Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of volunteers over more than 40 years. Your donations make it possible to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the creation of free electronic texts. We accept credit cards, checks and transfers from any country, in any currency.

Send a **Check** or **Money Order** (any currency) to:

  Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

  809 North 1500 West

### Credit Card Donations

Donate with a **Credit Card** by using one of these online services:

</p>

PayPal is a Web site that accepts credit card and bank transfer payments. You don't need to set up a PayPal account to donate via PayPal. Visa, MasterCard, Amex and Discover are accepted.

This is a Web site that accepts credit card donations and charges 3% overhead (similar to most credit cards). Donation is simple, similar to most online purchase transactions. A credit card with a mailing address in the US is required.
