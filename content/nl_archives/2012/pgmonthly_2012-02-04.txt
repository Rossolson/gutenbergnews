Project Gutenberg is off to a strong start in 2012.  Some fascinating
new eBooks have been released, and many updates have been made to
older titles.  Several new initiatives are underway, including efforts
to improve the appearance of PG eBooks on mobile devices such as
phones and tablets.  Stay tuned for progress, or join the discussions
on the gutvol-d list (http://lists.pglaf.org) or Distributed
Proofreaders forums at www.pgdp.net

The start of the year is a great time for new year's resolutions.  Perhaps
you would like to contribute to the corpus of free literature in the 
world?  Visit www.pgdp.net, or take a look at our submission guidelines:

The start of the year is also a time to think about how you can help
spread literature: give eBooks in 2012!  The Project Gutenberg CD/DVD
project, at www.gutenberg.org/cdproject, includes links to download
an entire disc's worth of eBooks.  This is a great start to a personal
library that you can share.

Thanks to all the Project Gutenberg volunteers, donors, and well-wishers.
