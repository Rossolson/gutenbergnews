This is the Project Gutenberg newsletter for January 2012.  Welcome to
the new year!  Historically, Michael Hart used this first Wednesday of
the new year to wrap up statistics for the prior year.

Production in 2011 was excellent, thanks to thousands of volunteers.
Project Gutenberg eBooks are in 60 languages, and most are available
as plain text and HTML.  2011 saw great progress in availability of
eBook reader and tablet formats.  You can find epub and MOBI (Kindle)
formats on the download pages at www.gutenberg.org.  For more

Bookshelves, linked from the main page at www.gutenberg.org.  Getting
started is easy!  In order to create or edit Bookshelves, you need a
