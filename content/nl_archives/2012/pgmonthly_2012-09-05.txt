** Thanks!

We received this email message at Project Gutenberg:

"I cannot properly express my gratitude and thanks to everyone at
Project Gutenberg. To yourself, the staff, including the people who
empty the trash bins, thank you.... thank you... thank you.

  You see, I'm dying of an inoperable brain tumor. Doctors tell me I
have a few months at most. While meandering around the internet, I
stumbled across the Tarzan series, authored by Edgar Rice Burroughs,
which your organization has made available in e-books. These are
absolutely the favorite books of my childhood. I haven't read them in
fifty years. Reading these books again after so many years brings an
enjoyment I thought I'd never feel again. To many, this may sound
trivial, but following the adventures of 'The Lord of the Jungle,'
which I loved so much as a child, allows me a few hours every day to
escape the harsh realities of life."


** A new mirror site in Bulgaria
