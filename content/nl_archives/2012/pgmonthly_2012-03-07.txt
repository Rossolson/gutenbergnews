Michael Hart would have turned 65 on his birthday, September 6 2012.

  Subhalekha, by Rama Mohana Rao Mahidhara
  www.gutenberg.org/etext/39004

This author, also known as Mahidhara Ramamohanarao, was a famous
novelist and journalist, a native of India.  He granted all of his
works to the Public Domain.  There is a nice biography of him, from
1997, at this location:

** Small grants available for digitization

Did you know that the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
can provide small grants to support people who are creating eBooks
for Project Gutenberg?  This can be for digitiation software,
or acquisition of printed books for digitization (up to $1/book only),
or similar purposes.  Email Greg Newby (gbnewby at pglaf.org) if you 
have ideas.


** Etext93, etext94 updated

Thanks to tremendous efforts from our posting team, especially
whitewashers David and Al, all files in etext93 and 94 have now been
updated and re-released.  In most cases, this includes updating or
adding HTML, and in some cases we used the new ReStructured Text (RST)
format.  RST is particularly friendly for conversion to mobile formats
including EPUB and MOBI.

Among these newly updated eBooks, you can find a video we posted in
1994 (many years before YouTube and similar services!) of the Apollo 11
moon landing:
  www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/116

Trivia: Contrary to popular belief, the first words spoken after humans
landed on the moon were not "The Eagle has Landed," nor "That's one small
step for [a] man...".  They were: "Contact light."
