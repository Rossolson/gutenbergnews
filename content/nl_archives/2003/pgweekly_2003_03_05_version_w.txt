If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
=09http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
=09http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:

Free Computers

Project Gutenberg has received a generous donation of over 20 Pentium
Pro 100 computers.  If you have a need for a computer to do Project
Gutenberg work or can make good use of computers please
let William Fishburne (william.fishburne@verizon.net) know!

The computers are physically in Northern Virginia and if you are not,
it would be necessary for you to arrange for the shipping cost.
Please send in your thoughts and ideas on how PG can make best use
of this dated windfall! =20

These are GREAT for any wordprocessing, etc. . .it's just about exactly
what I am using here,for all my Project Gutenberg work.  However, these
are NOT good for the "bloatware" operating systems and programs if you
are going to reload and reboot a lot. . .takes some real time for this.
However, I scanned the first books I ever OCRed on something much slower.=

Responses to the 'What is best for reading e-texts?' question

From: "Stewart C. Russell"

My choice is a palm and weasel reader (aka gutenpalm:=20
<http://gutenpalm.sourceforge.net/>). Fast, cheap, and light. Useful for=20
proofreading texts in preparation, too.

By curious coincidence, I've been using it to read Leacock books on the s=

I receive your Gutenburg newsletter each week, and have both a windows
based desktop computer and a Palm handheld using palm os. I found two=20
free readers for the palm os sytem that have free txt/html converters.
Isilo and weazel reader (formerly gutenpalm)are the ones that easy to
use free conversion tools.  The one for palm reader, Palm eBook Studio,
http://www.palmdigitalmedia.com/ebs.cgi , sells for $29.95 USD,
and is a little out of my reach at this time.

Recommended ebooks

From: Juliet Sutherland

When I started doing the post-processing work on "The Cruise of the=20
Kawa: Wanderings in the South Seas" by Walter E. Traprock, F.R.S.S.E.U.=20
1921c., I thought it was yet another travel book describing the author's
adventures in foreign lands. But certain phrases started to catch my eye=20
and I actually read some of the text. "Suddenly, as they do in the=20
tropics, an extraordinary thing happened. A simoon, a monsoon and a=20
typhoon met, head on, at the exact corner of the equator and the 180th=20
meridian. We hadn't noticed one of them..." Hmm, maybe not quite the=20
usual travelogue. "I heard it that time ... the faint, sweet note of the=20
male sea-robin." It took me awhile, but I eventually, with the help of=20
visiting relatives, figured out that the entire book is a wonderful=20
spoof. We spent the rest of the evening doing dramatic readings and=20
laughing until our sides hurt. I'd like to make a PG version that=20
includes the photographs, since they are an important part of the humor.=20
The description of the captain, "Captain Ezra Triplett was a hard-bitten=20
mariner. In fact, he was, I think, the hardest-bitten mariner I have=20
ever seen. He had been bitten, according to his own tell, man-and-boy,=20
for fifty-two years, by every sort of insect, rodent, and crustacean in=20
existence. He had had smallpox and three touches of scurvy, each of=20
these blights leaving its autograph." is amusing, but the true humor=20
comes from the accompanying picture of a baby-faced young man. A fine=20
book when you are in the mood for sophomoric humor.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can

help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

6) Headline News from around the world

RIGHT TO POSSESS OR RIGHT TO CREATE? WHICH CARD TRUMPS?
At the end of a recent mock trial sponsored by the Berkeley Center for La=
w
and Technology to debate issues of copyright in the digital age, the judg=
e
urged the participants: "Go back to work and clear up this mess for us. A=
nd
don't take too long to do it because we're losing ground fast." It's a ca=
se
of "digital rights management" (technology to place locks on DVDs and oth=
er
copyrighted material to prevent their being misappropriated) versus an
innovator's ability to make technological advances by taking a competitor=
's
products apart to understand how they work. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.),
who is introducing a bill to amend the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, says, "We have ceded too much power to copyright owners. People are
afraid to proceed on innovative measures." (New York Times 2 Mar 2003)

ALEXANDRIA LIBRARY PROJECT TO BUILD VAST ONLINE COLLECTION
A project at the new Alexandria Library in Egypt hopes to make
virtually every existing text available online. The Alexandria Library
Scholars Collective uses software called CyberBook Plus designed to
link archives of digital texts from around the world. In addition to
offering a single point of entry to access most of the world's texts,
the software includes virtual lecture halls, a hub for international
scholars, and a gateway for ordinary readers. David Wolff of
online-learning venture Fathom noted that doing any one of these
successfully would be challenging. The challenges confronting the
project include copyright, language barriers, and funding. The
project's primary sources of funding are currently the Egyptian
government and UNESCO.

EXPERTS FIND FAULT WITH CURRENT COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION
Experts speaking at a University of California at Berkeley conference
were in general agreement that copyright law is currently being applied
inappropriately. The event featured speakers from a range of companies
and institutions, representing a variety of perspectives on the issue
of copyright. Most speakers faulted the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (DMCA) and its application, saying the interests of the majority of
persons involved are not being served. Notable DMCA opponents Larry
Lessig and Edward Felten spoke out against the current state of
copyright enforcement. Alex Alben of RealNetworks also attended the
conference. He criticized a recent action by Lexmark, which has won a
preliminary injunction under the terms of the DMCA to prevent a
competitor from selling a chip that would allow Lexmark printers to
function with non-Lexmark toner cartridges. "This is a travesty," Alben
said. "This is not what we intended when we created the DMCA."

SENATOR OFFERS MARKET APPROACH TO COPYRIGHT
Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) has suggested that the answer to ongoing
wrangling over copyright is a policy of full disclosure. If content
producers are required to explain clearly to consumers how and under
what conditions a copyrighted work can be used or copied, users can
easily decide whether they will buy it. Wyden said his approach is a
market-based one; although the government would have to specify and
enforce disclosure provisions, market forces would compel action on the
part of media companies to keep consumers. Wyden argued that the
current influence of media companies on Congress will prevent any
legislative alteration of copyright law from passing any time soon.

NORWEGIAN TEEN FACES SECOND COPYRIGHT TRIAL
Jon Johansen of Norway was acquitted last month on charges of writing a
computer program that allowed copying of DVDs. The court ruled that
Johansen violated no laws because he used the program to make copies of
movies that were legally purchased. An appeals court has decided to
grant a new trial on behalf of the Motion Picture Association of
America, which had filed the original complaint against Johansen.
Johansen's attorney, Halvor Manshaus, said the appeal was not
unexpected and that he and his client are "confident with regard to the
final outcome," given that they won the case the first time it went to
trial. Rune Floisbonn, acting chief of the Economic Crime Unit's data
department, said, "This case is about important principles, and we are
very pleased that it will be tried again." The Motion Picture
Association of America estimates that the film industry loses $3
billion each year to piracy.

CHINA GETS LOOK AT MICROSOFT SOURCE CODE
China's Information Technology Security Certification Center will
participate in the Government Security Program (GSP), Microsoft's
initiative to share its Windows source code with international
governments to allay fears about the operating system's security.
During a two-day visit, Bill Gates met with President Jiang Zemin and
other Chinese dignitaries. Microsoft's promise to reveal any or all of
the Windows source code successfully wooed the Chinese government and
military, who were leaning towards open-source Linux as a more secure
option. Microsoft is promoting GSP to dozens of nations and
organizations and has announced agreements with Russia, NATO, and the
United Kingdom.
