[The Newsletter is now being sent in three sections, so you can directly
go to the portions you find most interesting:  1.  Founder's Comments,
2. News, Notes & Queries, and  3. Weekly eBook Update Listing.]


  This is Michael Hart's "Founder's Comments" section of the Newsletter


Over Our 32 23/53 Year History, We Have Now Averaged About 330 Ebooks/Yr
And This Year Averaged Over That Same New eBook Level. . .PER MONTH!!!!!


           We Are Averaging About 353 Per Month This Year!!!



***  HOT Requests!!!

We've had some requests for something like the Distributed Proofreaders
to take up various kinds of books, varying by subject, and by language.

Anyone interested in doing something like this, please contact us.

"Michael S. Hart" <hart@pobox.com>
Greg Newby <gbnewby@pglaf.org>

We want to make it easier for you to volunteer for what interests you!

However you want to do books, we'll try to find a way to support you.

***

For all those Portuguese readers out there, we have a new volunteer that
offered to coordinate and help anyone that wants to work on Portuguese
eBooks for project gutenberg. His name is Joco Neves and you can get in
touch with him at gutenberg@silvaneves.org.

If you don't have a specific book to work on, take a look first at
Distributed Proofreaders <http://www.pgdp.net/>. There are three
Portuguese eBooks on the first round, one in the second and two in
post-processing. We have the National Library of Portugal as a source of
eBooks, so how many eBooks and which books we choose is up to us.

Sim, i da tua ajuda que precisamos!!!

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

 http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/images

***

New site for PDA readable eBooks - now open for testing:

 http://mc.clintock.com/gutenberg/

The formats currently available are Plucker, iSilo, Doc, Rocket eBook,
and zTXT (as well as regular HTML). The etexts used are the ones on the
PG DVD image you released a few weeks ago, and they're stored in the
same directories, with the original archive names (e.g. ETEXT05/kafk10.zip).

Volunteers Needed For Some Harder-Than-Usual Reformatting

Please look at this URL, and see what we can use.  We have permission
for all of them.  Reformatting to plain text may be a challenge.

*** Requests For Assistance ***

Music Project

Interested in music?  Project Gutenberg's music project
(http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music) is seeking people to
digitize musical scores.  We also have a small budget to
work on publicity recruitment for our sheet music efforts.
Email Greg Newby <gbnewby AT pglaf.org> if you would like
more information.

***

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test 10K Special DVD here right now!!!
Nearly all of our first 10,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!


*** Project Gutenberg Is Seeking Legal Beagles ***

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have
regular needs for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby <gbnewby AT pglaf.org> ,
if you can help.

*** Continuing Requests For Assistance:

Project Gutenberg--Canada will be starting up soon.
Please let us know if you would like to volunteer!
Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,
and we have volunteers working on both of these.
We will also be seeking volunteers from others of
the "life +50" countries.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** HAVE WE GIVEN AWAY A TRILLION BOOKS/DOLLARS YET???

Statistical Review

In the 49 weeks of this year, we have produced 3957 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3957 eBooks!!!

         That's 49 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With 10,700 eBooks online as of December 10, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.93 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.53 when we had 6267 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 10,700 eBooks in 32 Years and 5.20 Months We Averaged
      330 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       27.5 Per Month
      .90 Per Day

At 3,957 eBooks Done In The 343 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     11.5 Per Day

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[Another Way To Keep Anyone From Buying Their Pills For Lower Prices?]

BAR CODES ON DRUGS
Pfizer Inc. is now placing tiny versions of supermarket bar codes on blister
packs of Dilantin, Lipitor and other pills sold to hospitals, and Abbott
Laboratories is putting bar codes on injected drugs. The FDA will soon be
issuing new rules forcing all manufacturers to begin phasing in bar codes on
hospital-sold drugs, although hospitals won't be required to use the codes.

[Remember, You Heard It Here First, Before Now]
[AND. . .THEY ARE ADMITTING THAT DIGITAL REPLICATION IS FOR *THEM*. . .
BUT ALL THE WHILE THEY PASS LAWS THAT KEEP US FROM REPLICATING WHAT WAS
*LEGAL* TO COPY BEFORE ALL THE COPYRIGHT EXTENSIONS!!!]

THE NEW ECONOMY IS BACK -- BUT NOT THE JOBS
The latest economic indicators -- rising productivity, fewer jobs -- could
signal a vindication for all those IT managers who spent big bucks on
technology improvements in the last decade, says Fortune columnist David
Kirkpatrick: "We may be entering the second great technology boom. The
first one, of the late '90s, was a boom in expectations, which pushed up
stock valuations and investor enthusiasm in the belief that the new
technologies born of the Internet would fundamentally transform the
economy^E Contrary to what over-eager investors thought in the '90s, the
users of the technology, not the producers, will be the bigger
beneficiaries." Comparing today's corporate processes with those existing
the last time the U.S. emerged from a recession, there are striking
differences. Today, most large manufacturers have built a significant,
sophisticated enterprise resource planning (ERP) infrastructure to automate
the supply chain and provide real-time data on inventory and profits.
E-commerce is now routine -- both for manufacturing giants and for
consumers. Communication among workers both within corporations and between
companies is now automated via e-mail and Web portals, speeding the
implementation of corporate edicts and the fulfillment of business orders.
Meanwhile the casualty of all this efficiency has been jobs -- about 2
million eliminated in the last two years in the U.S. as companies
streamline processes and outsource functions to overseas workers. And
that's not likely to change, says Kirkpatrick, who warns, "To keep your job
in this new world, you'd better be doing something that benefits from a
digitized economy." (Fortune.com 4 Dec 2003)

NEGOTIATORS DRAFT GLOBAL INTERNET GROUND RULES
Participants from 192 countries have succeeded in narrowing their
differences on the issue of how best to expand the Internet, but remain
undecided as to whether rich nations should foot the entire bill.
"Unfortunately, we didn't settle everything, but one has to be realistic.
We're probably at 98%," says Marc Furrer, the Swiss official who brokered
the negotiations prior to the start of the three-day World Summit on the
Information Society on Wednesday. More than 60 heads of state will attend
the U.N.-sponsored meeting and the hope has been to have draft agreements
prepared ahead of time for approval. African nations are advocating the
creation of a special "digital solidarity fund" to pay for expanding
Internet access to remote villages, but the U.S., Japan and European
countries have suggested that existing development aid should be used to
accomplish that. Meanwhile, negotiators have agreed to include in their
proposals wording supporting the commitment to press freedom taken from the
U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to maintain the status
quo on Internet governance, with the core systems based in the U.S. and
managed by ICANN. The declaration also calls on governments to work
together to combat spam and improve Internet security. (AP 8 Dec 2003)

SUMMIT PARTICIPANTS FACE 500-FOOT-HIGH VIRTUAL BILLBOARD
Participants at this week's World Summit on the Information Society will be
greeted by a 500-foot-high laser-light display that will beam thousands of
SMS messages onto a wall of water formed by the shooting jets of Lake
Geneva's Jet d'Eau, the world's tallest fountain. Internet users will be
able to post their messages almost instantly onto the fountain display, or
onto the northern fagade of the U.N. building in New York, a mountain face
in Rio de Janiero, or the front of a Bombay skyscraper. It's all part of
the Helloworld Project, the brainchild of Swiss Web designer Johannes Gees,
and is similar to a smaller version he debuted at the 2001 World Economic
Forum in Davos. "The idea is to use the media to allow people to get their
message across to powerful people," says Gees. "With this project's
intervention into public space, I give people who don't have money the
power to be present in a big, visible way." Requests from governments to
edit the messages have been refused, although Gees says his 12 multilingual
editors will screen out messages with personal insults, commercial content,
racism or sexism. He's also discouraging people from sending "Hi,
Mom!"-type messages. (Wired.com 8 Dec 2003)

FEDERAL AID RULES WAIVED FOR FIVE DISTANCE-ED PROVIDERS
The Department of Education has expanded the list of institutions
exempt from the 50-percent rule, which denies federal aid to students
of programs that teach more than half their courses at a distance or
enroll more than half of their students as distance students. The rule
was designed to discourage distance education programs that were not
reputable, but critics have complained that the rule stifles
development of legitimate programs. Added to the list of exempted
institutions as part of the Distance Education Demonstration Program
are the College of Court Reporting Inc., Graceland University, Jones
International University, National Technological University Inc., and
Northcentral University, bringing the total to 29. The demonstration
program will continue through 2005, though there are currently
proposals before Congress to permanently ease the 50-percent rule.

TASK FORCE URGES BETTER FEDERAL INFORMATION SHARING
A report issued by the Markle Foundation calls on the federal
government to move away from the "Cold War" mentality of its current
approach to national security and open networks to a range of law
enforcement officials. The report, "Creating A Trusted Information
Network for Homeland Security," was written by a task force co-chaired
by James Barksdale, former CEO of Netscape. The task force argues that
the intense level of security applied by federal officials is no longer
appropriate for the risks of today. Rather than hiding information
inside its own networks, the federal government should share that
information with state and local governments. The report also
encourages cooperation with the private sector in sharing information
to protect national security, but cautions that such sharing would need
to protect civil liberties.

More Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media

MORE REASONS WHY THE U.S. JOB MARKET LOOKS SO GRIM

Some recent research polls have indicated that of the jobs
advertised in U.S. newspapers, some 90% are given to those
who were already friends and acquaintances of the members
of the job search panels and committees.

HUGE GOVERMENT "PORK" EARMARKING PROBLEM

As you probably heard, the funding bill for thousands of
"pork barrel" projects was NOT passed today, and so won't
come up again until January 20.

What you may NOT have heard was the literally THOUSANDS
of reasons it wasn't passed, the silliest things money
can buy. . .or can't, in this case.

However, the Republician party leaders made a comment
that due to this dereliction of duty by the Democrats,
many people will not get flu vaccinations this year.

Sorry to say, but as far as I know, this is pure hokum.

Doctors told me several things in total contradiction:

1.  Flu vaccinations are mostly given before this time.

2.  The vaccines we have this year aren't particularly
    well targeted at the the specific flu we have now.

3.  It would take until well after the flu season for
    more vaccines to be made.  It's a long slow thing.
