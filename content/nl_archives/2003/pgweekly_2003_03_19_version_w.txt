Coming to our attention this week, with thanks to Alev Akman.

Author Uzanne predicted "The End Of Books" back in '94...

1894, that is. A scholar at the University of Iowa's Obermann Center for Advanced Studies has digitized an article from the July-December 1894 issue of Scribner's Magazine Illustrated. It's actually a broad set of predictions of what life will be like in the 21st Century, but the author's predictions about books and reading are of most interest to us: "My friend James Whittemore interrupted me. "And what will become of the libraries, dear friend, and of the books?" "Librarieswill be transformed into phonographotecks, or rather, phonostereoteks; they will contain the works of human genius on properly labelled cylinders, methodically arranged in little cases, rows upon rows, on shelves.

This is a fascinating site, beautifully put together, and the ideas are fabulous, a must read for any PGer. You can find out more at http://www.uiowa.edu/~obermann

4) Readers letters

Favourite Book

From: Tonya Allen

The Haunted Bookshop, a book-lover's book

I love discovering books and authors in a serendipitous and random way. If a book I'm reading mentions another book, you can be sure I'll try to track it down. A book about the Titanic led me to Project Gutenberg, mentioning that among the passengers of that ill-fated ship was John Jacob Astor IV, the builder of New York's Astoria hotel, and also the author of a science fiction novel, A Journey In Other Worlds. I started off on the trail of this 1894 book, and my search led me to PG and the world of etexts.

One of my favorite PG etexts is Christopher Morley's The Haunted Bookshop. Steeped in the immediate post-World War I mood of uncertainty and intrigue, the plot revolves around a copy of Carlyle's Oliver Cromwell which appears and disappears mysteriously from its place on the shelf. By the time the mystery is resolved, the bookshop's proprietor has strolled among many yards of shelves and pointed out many of his favorite books, which he regards more as living forces than inanimate objects:

"Did you ever notice how books track you down and hunt you out?
They follow you like the hound in Francis Thompson's poem.
They know their quarry!  Look at that book The Education of Henry Adams!
Just watch the way it's hounding out thinking people this winter.
And The Four Horsemen--you can see it racing in the veins
of the reading people.  It's one of the uncanniest things I know
to watch a real book on its career--it follows you and follows
you and drives you into a corner and MAKES you read it.
There's a queer old book that's been chasing me for years:
The Life and Opinions of John Buncle, Esq., it's called.
I've tried to escape it, but every now and then it sticks up
its head somewhere.  It'll get me some day, and I'll be compelled
to read it.  Ten Thousand a Year trailed me the same way until
I surrendered.  Words can't describe the cunning of some books.
You'll think you've shaken them off your trail, and then one day
some innocent-looking customer will pop in and begin to talk,
and you'll know he's an unconscious agent of book-destiny."

The list of books mentioned in The Haunted Bookshop is wonderfully random and includes many genres and topics--mysteries, romances, social history, a study of tea. Many have intriguing titles ("Confessions of a Thug", "Whispers about Women", "Somebody's Luggage", "The Story of My Heart"). The power of the written word in shaping history is expressed in a dramatic catalog of World War I writing:

"In regard to the War, think what books have accomplished.
What was the first thing all the governments started to do--
publish books!  Blue Books, Yellow Books, White Books, Red Books--
everything but Black Books, which would have been appropriate in Berlin.
They knew that guns and troops were helpless unless they could get the books
on their side, too.  Books did as much as anything else
to bring America into the war.  Some German books helped to wipe
the Kaiser off his throne--_I_ Accuse, and Dr. Muehlon's magnificent
outburst The Vandal of Europe, and Lichnowsky's private memorandum,
that shook Germany to her foundations, simply because he told the truth.
Here's that book Men in War, written I believe by a Hungarian officer, with
its noble dedication "To Friend and Foe."  Here are some of
the French books--books in which the clear, passionate intellect
of that race, with its savage irony, burns like a flame.
Romain Rolland's Au-Dessus de la Melee, written in exile in Switzerland;
Barbusse's terrible Le Feu; Duhamel's bitter Civilization;
Bourget's strangely fascinating novel The Meaning of Death.
And the noble books that have come out of England:  A Student in Arms;
The Tree of Heaven; Why Men Fight, by Bertrand Russell--I'm hoping
he'll write one on Why Men Are Imprisoned:  you know he was locked
up for his sentiments!  And here's one of the most moving of all--
The Letters of Arthur Heath, a gentle, sensitive young Oxford tutor
who was killed on the Western front.  You ought to read that book.
It shows the entire lack of hatred on the part of the English.
Heath and his friends, the night before they enlisted, sat up singing
the German music they had loved, as a kind of farewell to the old,
friendly joyous life.  Yes, that's the kind of thing War does--
wipes out spirits like Arthur Heath.  Please read it.
Then you'll have to read Philip Gibbs, and Lowes Dickinson
and all the young poets.  Of course you've read Wells already.
Everybody has."

This was the perfect book for me, and for any book-lover. I followed the example of the bookshop's proprietor, who during one journey along the shelves "took out a memorandum book and began jotting down the books that intrigued him." I opened a computer file and made my own list. I've been following it up ever since, and have found many of the titles at PG. All of the books mentioned qualify for PG at least as far as publication date goes, so anyone looking for ideas for new etexts might drop by.... The Haunted Bookshop.

The first in our 'Please explain this...' series.
We start with everyone's favourite question.

Hey, Alice,
Just to let you know I like the letters section -- it's always nice to hear about books...
This may sound stupid, but maybe someone, sometime, could explain how the numbering system works, and why books being processed now have dates two years heance, what reserved numbers are, etc.
I've only been doing this for about a year, so maybe I've overlooked some info somewhere...

So, thanks to Brett for the following:

Why do books have numbers 2 years hence?

Simple answer:  We didn't expect to do so well.  At some point or other, Michael set up 100 books/month as the standard PG production month {We have to start somewhere}.  Well, production picked up and soon we were over a year ahead, then two years. The theory was that there was a delay between posting and release to allow the readers of the newsletter to read these new books and find any mistakes. The practice is that so few people offer corrections it doesn't matter. As time went on, we were soon rushing ahead and anticipated being three years ahead. It was proposed that we increase the number per month to 150 with the thinking that we would soon catch up. I think that we are now within a year and in about two more years should catch these numbers.

What are reserved numbers?

Simple answer: Reserved numbers are book numbers grabbed in advance. We have some "special numbers" usually the numbers ending in "000" that are "reserved" for special books. In addition, we have some volunteers who do tens of books a month. They do this consistently and usually work on a group of books by the same author. Thus, we offer them a block of numbers which are reserved for their use. There are also some numbers reserved for books Michael anticipated getting but hasn't gotten yet.


I hope this helps, Alice

Subject: [ebook-community] Web based eBook Reading interface

For those whom are interested:

    I have recently completed a web-based eBook reading GUI using CSS and
XHTML. Naturally, how well it works will depend on your particular browser,
but I have gotten workable results using the following browsers:

    Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0
    Opera 7.0
    Mozilla 1.0
    Netscape 7.0

    This interface is the type of thing can could be easily implemented on a
floppy or CD for distribution, providing the user with a nice workable
reading environment, without the need for an application install (assuming
they have the appropriate browser).

    Feel free to try the GUI out at http://www.raptorbook.org/.

    When you view a book, you will see a link labeled "Read using the
RaptorBook Reader web interface". Click that, and you are off. :-)

    Quick examples:
        The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn ->
http://www.raptorbook.org/book.php?r=89
        Gettysburg Address -> http://www.raptorbook.org/book.php?r=90
        The Wisdom Of Father Brown ->
http://www.raptorbook.org/book.php?r=103

    If you try it, and find that it works in other browsers, feel free to
let me know -- any other comments are appreciated as well.

Sincerely,
    James Linden

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can

help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

6) Headline News from around the world

BEWARE THE SPELLCHECKER
A study at the University of Pittsburgh reveals that the ubiquitous
spellchecker software may be doing as much harm as good, when it comes to
writing. In the study, 33 undergraduate students were asked to proofread a
one-page business letter -- half of them using Microsoft Word, with its
spell- and grammar-checking features and the other half using only their
brains. Without the software, students with higher SAT verbal scores made,
on average, five errors, compared with 12.3 errors made by students with
lower scores. However, using the software, the two groups made about the
same number of errors -- 16 vs. 17. Dennis Galletta, a professor of
information systems at the Katz Business School, says people have come to
rely on spellchecking software too completely. "It's not a software
problem, it's a behavior problem." (AP 14 Mar 2003)

RECORD LABELS WARN COMPANIES OF 'SIGNIFICANT LEGAL DAMAGES'
The Recording Industry Association of America has sent letters to about 300 
companies, informing them that their computers were being used by workers 
for illegal file-swapping and threatening "significant legal damages" for 
employers and employees alike. The new tactic is the RIAA's first 
systematic effort to tackle digital music piracy that occurs using 
corporate networks, following a similar effort to enlist universities in 
the fight against illegal file-sharing. Copyright law experts said 
companies might be liable for piracy on their networks if they know about 
it and don't intervene, but it's unclear whether companies have an 
obligation to police their networks and remove unauthorized copies of songs 
without being asked to. "I think what they're trying to do is get people 
thinking 'Gee, I'm in this gray area, and I don't want to be the guy who 
gets fingered for the test case,'" says one intellectual property attorney. 
"As a corporation, do you really want to be in the news defending the right 
of your employees to have pirated music on your network?" About 35% of the 
letters went to information technology companies, 20% to healthcare firms, 
20% to manufacturers, and the rest to miscellaneous industries. (Los 
Angeles Times 18 Mar 2003)

NEW TARGET FOR COPYRIGHT ENFORCEMENT: ORGANIZED CRIME
Representatives from the Motion Picture Association of America and
Microsoft testified before Congress that organized gangs operating in
countries like Russia and Malaysia are stealing intellectual property
and profiting from making counterfeit software and DVDs. In addition to
counterfeit labels and discs covered under current federal
anticounterfeiting laws, Microsoft supports a change to the law to
cover fake holograms and other packaging material. Recent versions of
Microsoft Office have an edge-to-edge hologram etched into an entire
side of a CD-ROM. Counterfeiters can't replicate the technology, so
they deceive consumers with high-quality holographic stickers instead.
The importance of prosecuting such criminal activity was argued by a
Justice Department official who sees a link between copyright piracy
and terrorism.

SPELLING AND GRAMMAR CHECKERS ADD ERRORS
In a study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, computer spelling
and grammar checkers actually increased the number of errors for most
students. The study looked at the performance of two groups of
students: one with relatively high SAT verbal scores and one with
relatively lower scores. The group with lower SAT scores made an
average of 12.3 mistakes without the spelling and grammar tools turned
on and 17 mistakes with the tools. The students with higher SAT scores
made an average of 5 mistakes without the tools and an average of 16
errors with the tools. According to Dennis Galletta, a professor of
information systems at the Katz Business School, the problem is one of
behavior rather than of technology. Some students, he said, trust the
software too much. Richard Stern, a speech-recognition technology
researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, said that when computers
attempt to identify proper grammar, the computer has to make some
guesses. It becomes "a percentage game," he said.
