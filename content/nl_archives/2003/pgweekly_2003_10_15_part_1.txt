!!!

I need a copy of zip for AIX that can do the "-9" high compression,
and still unzip via the standard unzip programs!!!

***

I am working on trying to collect and convert some public domain folk tunes
to ABC notation.  Could use some help tracking down public domain versions
of the melodies or proof that these songs are in the public domain.  Songs
I'm working on at present include:
I Know Where I'm Going
Simple Gifts
She Moved Throught The Fair
A Sailor Courted a Farmer's Daughter (aka Constant Lovers)
The Fisher Who Died in His Bed
Ufros Alienu
If anyone's interesting in converting folk songs to a digital public
domain format and would like to help or if you want to contact me, you can
do so through the mailing list at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pdsongs

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test DVD here right now!!!  Nearly all
of our first 9,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have
regular needs for intellectual property legal advice

if you can help.

Project Gutenberg--Canada will be starting up soon.
Please let us know if you would like to volunteer!

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM OUR MIRROR SITES

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://gutenberg.net/list.html  can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer.


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 41 weeks of this year, we have produced 3263 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3263 eBooks!!!

         That's 41 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With 10,006 eBooks online as of October 08, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.00 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.63 when we had 6145 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 10,006 books each costing $.62 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 10,006 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 10,006 eBooks in 32 Years and 4.25 Months We Averaged
      309 Per Year   [We do more per month these days!]
      26 Per Month
     .84 Per Day

At 3263 eBooks Done In The 287 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     11.4 Per Day
     79.6 Per Week
    350.3 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was

From Newsscan:

MICROSOFT VOWS TO FIX WINDOWS SECURITY PROBLEMS
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has admitted the inadequacy the company's
current collection of security software patches for the Windows operating
system and says the company will modify them in the coming year. Customers
have complained that the company's system of frequently issuing new patches
is too time-consuming and difficult, so Microsoft is now designing
technology to shield Windows from malicious e-mail messages, viruses and
worms. The changes will include shipping Windows with an Internet firewall
turned on by default, which would have blocked the recent "Blaster" virus,
and will prevent attachments from executing commands -- a common method
network vandals use to hijack computers. (San Jose Mercury News 10 Oct 2003)

INTEL'S ANDY GROVE WORRIED ABOUT U.S. LEAD IN HIGH TECH
Telling the attendees at a global technology summit "I'm here to be the
skunk at your garden party," Andrew S. Grove, Intel co-founder and current
chairman, said that U.S. dominance in the software and technology service
businesses is under siege by countries like China and India that offer
cheap labor costs and strong incentives for new financial investment. Grove
noted that India's thriving software industry, which does a steadily
increasing proportion of the software and services work for U.S. companies,
could surpass the United States in software and tech-service jobs by 2010.
Grove said that the U.S. had no public policy to deal with this situation,
nor had he found that any of the presidential candidates had recognized the
problem. He also said the U.S. lags dangerously behind in popular use of
high-speed Internet connections, as well as funding for science and
technology research and education. (Washington Post 9 Oct 2003)

TEXT-MESSAGING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA
Text-messaging services in China have become wildly popular, to the extent
that 200 billion text messages will be sent this year through cell phones
across China. Internet analyst Nathan Midler for the research firm IDC says
the explanation is rather simple: "It's cheaper than actually making a
phone call." Midler also suggests a simple answer to the question of why
the U.S. technology companies have missed a great marketing opportunity in
China: "Why have companies like AOL and Yahoo not succeeded in China? The
simple answer is that the barrier to entry is pretty significant." (Knight

MICROSOFT MODIFIES IE AFTER COURT RULING
Microsoft has opted to make changes to the way its Web browser
functions after a court ruled that the software company had violated a
patent held by Eolas Technologies. The patent covers how Web pages
automatically call applications such as Flash or QuickTime to run audio
or video. A court ruled the Microsoft's Internet Explorer uses the
patented technology to accomplish this and that the company must pay
Eolas $521 million for the technology. Eolas suggested that Microsoft
keep the technology in its browser and arrange licensing terms.
Instead, Microsoft, which said it will appeal the ruling, will make
changes to Internet Explorer to sidestep the patented technology. As a
result, some users will be presented with a pop-up screen alerting them
that the browser will start the necessary application to run the Web
page. Microsoft said it will offer tips to Web developers on how to
change their Web pages to avoid the pop-ups even with the modified
version of Internet Explorer, which is expected early next year.

MICROSOFT ANNOUNCES REVISED PATCHING STRATEGY
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer this week announced major changes to the
company's strategy for software patches. Acknowledging that the
current schedule of weekly patches is onerous for many users and that
the patching systems are cumbersome, Ballmer said that Microsoft would
begin issuing patches no more frequently than once a month, except for
emergency situations. Ballmer noted that the company's current total
of 68 different patching systems was "a little extreme" and that future
patches would be of better quality than some previous patches. Users
will also have the ability to roll back future patches in the event of
incompatibility or other problems. Ballmer added that future patches
would be 30 to 80 percent smaller to help avoid problems for users on
slow connections.

[Could GM Sue For Saying You Can Exceed Speed Limits By Pushing Pedal Harder?]

COMPANY THREATENS TO SUE STUDENT
SunnComm Technologies said it will likely sue John "Alex" Halderman, a
graduate student at Princeton University, after Halderman published a
paper explaining how to defeat CD copy protections developed by
SunnComm. Halderman's paper pointed out SunnComm's copy protections
can be avoided simply by holding the "Shift" key when loading the
protected CD in a computer, which prevents the protection software from
installing. The paper also gave instructions for turning off the
software if it is installed. Peter Jacobs, CEO of SunnComm, said
Halderman had damaged the company's name and might be subject to
prosecution under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which
forbids circumventing copy-protection technologies. Some observers
believe that Halderman's actions fall outside the purview of the DMCA
because the paper was an academic publication, it uses features of all
Windows computers, and it was not distributed for profit.

SUNNCOMM BACKS AWAY FROM LAWSUIT THREAT
One day after security firm SunnComm Technologies threatened to sue a
Princeton University graduate student for revealing how to defeat the
company's CD copy-protection technology, CEO Peter Jacobs withdrew the
threat. When Princeton student John Halderman published a paper earlier
in the week with details about sidestepping SunnComm's technology,
Jacobs accused Halderman of defaming the company and threatened him
with civil and criminal prosecution. Jacobs on Friday conceded that
filing lawsuits would have been a mistake, saying, "It wasn't our
intention to strike a blow against research."

WEB SITE ABOUT DIPLOMA MILLS CAUSES CONTROVERSY
A physics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
has taken down a Web site with research on diploma mills after meeting
with university administrators. According to George Gollin, officials
from the university ordered him to remove the Web site from university
servers after some of the institutions profiled threatened to sue the
university. A spokesperson from the university denied that Gollin was
ordered to shut down the site, saying, "We were trying to help him find
a more appropriate place for his Web site." She noted that because
Gollin is a professor of physics, the issue of diploma mills and
accreditation falls outside his area of expertise and does not meet the
university's public-service requirement. Gollin's work will now be
available on the State of Oregon's Office of Degree Authorization
site. Alan Contreras, administrator of that site, called the research
"superb" and said it is "a very helpful consumer-protection tool."

Other Items Not Getting The Coverage They Should


Nobel Prize Committee Ignores Patent Holder In MRI Nobel Prize Awards

Dr. Raymond V. Damadian, president of the Fonar Corporation in Melville,
N.Y., who holds the basic patent on Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and who
was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1997, in which case General Electric
was ordered to pay $129 million for their patent infringment, has been
overlooked in this week's Nobel Prize's, which were instead offered to
Paul Lauterbur of the University of Illinois and Sir Peter Mansfield
of the University of Nottingham, England.

Damidian has received the other major awards for MRI, and no reason
has been given by the Nobel Committee for excluding Dr. Damidian.
