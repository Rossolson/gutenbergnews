DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!


Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


We will also have this
new address in Chicago!


Charles Aldarondo
701 Riverside Drive
Park Ridge, IL 60068


Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. <mr_der@hotmail.com> is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

From: Miranda van de Heijning <m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com>
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the 6 weeks of this year, we have produced 358 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1995 to produce our FIRST 358 eBooks!!!

         That's 6 WEEKS as Compared to 24 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 7,101 eBooks online as of February 12, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.41 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.19 when we had 4559 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing $.78 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

[My Comments In Brackets]

MOORE'S LAW GOOD FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS
Moore's Law -- the theory espoused by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that
the number of transistors on a computer chip would double every 18 months
or so -- is still valid, says Moore, who sees "no apparent roadblocks" for
at least another decade. "It gets complicated and expensive, but the
technological solutions seem to be there." Even if we get to the point where
we can't squeeze any more [transistors] in there, we'll be putting billions
of transistors on a chip. It's certainly not the end of creativity in the
industry." Moore predicted that growth in the semiconductor industry would
equal growth in the world's gross domestic product by 2017 if the industry
continues at its current pace. (AP 10 Feb 2003)

[Something I Have Been Pushing For Years]
LAPTOP HANDOUT COULD FREE UP CLASSROOM SPACE
The president of Miami-Dade County's teacher's union has told Florida
Governor Jeb Bush that the state could save $30 million by giving laptop
computers to all high school students and teachers and converting 1,680
computer labs to classrooms. United Teachers of Dade president Pat Tornillo
says buying the 644,000 laptops would be much cheaper than building 1,680
classrooms, noting that the number of computer labs represents the
equivalent of 34 high school buildings. (AP/Miami Herald 11 Feb 2003)

LIGHTBULB IDEA
Incandescent lightbulbs, neon tubes and fluorescent lamps are expected to
go the way of the gas lamp: into the history books. The emerging
"solid-state lighting" industry, based on LED (light-emitting diode)
microchips is expected to make its presence felt in the general home and
office lighting market as early as 2007. Currently used mainly in
large-scale projects such as the Nasdaq sign in Times Square, Chicago's
Goodman Theatre, or the White House Christmas tree, offer huge performance
advantages. An example: an LED traffic light consumes 80% less electricity
and lasts ten times longer than a traditional light.

[Of Course It's MBA's. . . .]
THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF ONLINE GRADUATE PROGRAMS
Tens of thousands of students are now obtaining MBA degrees using courses
taken over the Internet, and online programs through institutions such as
Phoenix University and Regis University produce more MBA graduates than
such schools as Harvard or Yale. The target market for such programs? The
traveling executive who completes the work on airplanes and in hotel rooms.
Degree programs offered by Regis or Phoenix might cost $25,000 or more;
institutions such as Duke University, which offers a Global Executive Program
which combines online learning and traditional classroom sessions meeting
every eight weeks, costs $100,500, which includes everything but airfare.

POWER COMPANIES TEST BROADBAND TECHNOLOGY
Energy utility Ameren Corp. and other power companies are testing
technology that would deliver high-speed Internet access over their power
lines, making every home electrical outlet an always-on Web connection. The
FCC has applauded the energy companies' efforts, with chairman Michael
Powell saying the technology "could simply blow the doors off the provision
of broadband." But existing broadband providers and others are skeptical,
saying that while they consider the technology intriguing, talk about it
has been around for years, with nothing to show for it. "I think they're a
long way from proving it, let's leave it there," says Larry Carmichael, a
project manager with the Electric Power Research Institute. "The tests to
date have been so small as far as looking at the financial and technical
viability. It's still at the very early stage of development."

AIRLINE TRAVEL DOWN, AIRLINE BOOKING SYSTEM UP
Profit margins for Sabre Holdings, the world's largest computer system, are
higher this year than airlines themselves ever achieve -- and certainly
better than in this year, when overall travel is down. An executive of
America West Airlines says: "They charge exorbitant rates relative to the
value they add. It is a cost that we don't find justified." But Sabre chief
executive William J. Hannigan brushes that accusation to the side: "I make
no apologies for our pricing structure. It is a structure that was created
by the airlines, and you always have to take it with a grain of salt when
they complain about it." A number of airlines are threatening to bypass the
reservation system and pull more of their best fares off of Sabre and its
rivals (Galileo, Worldspan, and Amadeus); if they follow through on their
threats, travel agents will find it harder than ever to find for their
customers the best itineraries at the best prices.

President Bush has signed a secret order allowing the government to proceed
with developing guidelines on circumstances under which the U.S. could
launch cyber-attacks against foreign computer systems. The directive

REPORTER PERPETRATES WEB HOAX ON FELLOW JOURNALIST
Although it violates journalistic ethics for a reporter to misrepresent his
identity, freelance journalist Brian McWilliams (whose work has appeared
Salon and Wired News) used a fake Web site and phony [name] to deceive
Computerworld's Dan Verton into believing that he was a Pakistan-based
terrorist who unleashed the recent Slammer network worm on the world.
Computerworld published, then quickly retracted, Verton's story. McWilliams
says he wanted to teach reporters "to be more skeptical of people who claim
they're involved in cyber-terrorism." Computerworld editor-in-chief
Maryfran Johnson says, "I couldn't believe a journalist could do this to
another journalist," and Verton says, "I feel like I've been had, and
that's never an easy thing to swallow. So, I'm left here scratching fleas
as the price you sometimes pay for sleeping with dogs."

[What Have I Been Saying About Pay-Per-Everything?]
STREAMING PATENT HAS NET RADIO SITES STEAMED
A company that says it owns patents on the process of transmitting
compressed audio or video online is flexing its muscle, demanding fees from
a host of Internet multimedia companies. Acacia Media Technologies says its
patents may even cover pay-per-view movies on cable TV and in hotel rooms.
And while Acacia's move has outraged Internet entrepreneurs, many of them
are reluctantly forking over the fees. "We did research on the claims and
found that they were pretty clear -- somewhat broad, but specific enough to
cover us," says Zack Zalon, general manager of the Radio Free Virgin Web
site. "We realized that they were tight enough that a license would be
substantially less expensive in the long run than litigation." Meanwhile,
the trend toward companies exercising ownership over what generally are
viewed as overly broad patents has drawn the ire of many experts, but
analysts admit it's a strategy that's likely to increase in popularity.
"With the economy the way it is, you see a lot more people trying to
leverage their intellectual property. It's one of the few ways left that
people can actually make money," says Rich Belgard, an independent patent
consultant. (CNet News.com 6 Feb 2003)

MICROSOFT SAYS ITS BUSINESS MODEL IS THREATENED BY OPEN-SOURCE
In its quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission
(SEC), Microsoft writes: "The popularization of the open-source movement
continues to pose a significant challenge to the company's business
model... The company's revenues would be unfavorably impacted if customers
reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing
products because new product offerings are not perceived as adding
significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers."
Not surprisingly, Microsoft also asserted its belief that "the commercial
software development model offers superior consumer value compared to the
open source model" because of its "powerful incentives to develop
innovative software that is useful, reliable, and compatible with other
software and hardware." (InfoWorld 5 Feb 2003)

HP OFFERS CONSUMER INCENTIVES FOR COMPUTER RECYCLING
Hewlett-Packard will offer e-coupons exchangeable for HP products when

range from $20 to $50 in value, depending on the amount a consumer spends
on recycling services, which cost from $17 to $30 depending on the size of
the equipment to be recycled. An HP executive said: "This is a way to learn
what our customers want. Do they even want an incentive? Or do they just
want to fill out a form and leave a box on their doorstep? We know that
waste is a growing problem in the industry, but no one has really studied
what consumers want to do to get rid of their computers.'' (AP/San Jose

PEOPLE WHO PLAY AT WORK, WORK AT HOME
What employers lose in productivity when workers goof off, bidding on eBay
and circulating jokes, is made up in the home, according to a survey by the
University of Maryland and Rockbridge Associates. The study found that
employees with Web access both at home and at work spend an average of 3.7
hours a week doing personal online chores in the office. Those same
employees, however, spend an average of 5.9 hours a week at home catching
up on work. "I think what this says is the Internet is actually helping
business productivity," says Roland Rust, director of the Center for
eService at the U. of Md.'s Robert H. Smith School of Business. Rust warns
that, based on his findings, employers should think twice about banning
personal online activities in the office. (Wall Street Journal 6 Feb 2003)

Mr. CARD: Every single day, the president gets a report on how we're doing
in the war against terror, and we're making
tremendous progress, I think unprecedented progress, thanks to the
assistance of allies around the world. We'd like to see
more of the leadership of al-Qaeda brought to justice, and we're working to
make that happen, but Osama bin Laden is clearly
not as great a threat as he was prior to September 11th, but his network and
he are still planning to do nasty things to us and
the president knows the challenges of being in a war on terrorism is
something that strains the country and the world, and yet it's
very important that we help to eliminate threats that would be compounded by
terrorists if they got access to weapons of mass
destruction. After all, the president's job is to make sure that that
ultimate fear of society, which would be anarchy, doesn't
happen, and terrorist acts are acts inviting anarchy, and this president's
going to do everything he can to make sure that we do
not have anarchy in this country.

THE ULTIMATE FEAR OF AMERICANS IS ANARCHY    [or is it???]


Andrew Card, President Bush's White House Chief of Staff, said,
in a trial-balloon just before The State of the Union Message:

"After all, the president's job is to make sure that that ultimate fear of
society, which would be anarchy, doesn't happen, and terrorist acts are acts
inviting anarchy, and this president's going to do everything he can to make
sure that we do not have anarchy in this country."


Apparently when they ran this up the flagpole to see who would salute it,
the hoped for support failed to materialize, and this was not included.

ADVISORY GROUPS TO OVERSEE TIA PROGRAM
The Pentagon formed an internal and an external committee to address
privacy concerns arising from the Total Information Awareness (TIA)
program in a move to prevent Congress from monitoring the program too
closely. Headed by John Poindexter, TIA aims to identify terrorists by
monitoring Internet usage and commercial and financial databases in the
U.S. and abroad. A Senate amendment last month banned deployment of the
program and curbed research for it. The Pentagon formed the advisory
panels to minimize the scope of the provision, now before a House-Senate
conference committee, by convincing Congress that the committees
will adequately address balancing security and privacy concerns.
Senator Ron Wyden, who sponsored the provision, noted that the panels
"did not get an election certificate" and that "Congress on a
bipartisan basis is going to continue to demand accountability,
oversight, and legally established safeguards."

ELECTRICAL OUTLETS OFFER POTENTIAL FOR INTERNET ACCESS
St. Louis-based Meren Corp. and other utilities are testing a
technology that would provide high-speed Web access through power
lines, potentially making every electrical outlet a connection to the
Internet. Federal regulators support the concept as a means of
bolstering broadband access, among other benefits, and tout the
advantage of employing an existing infrastructure of power lines.
Broadband providers, meanwhile, point out that the idea has been around
for years without concrete results. Network interference, transformers,
and surge arrestors have hindered broadband delivery, although improved
technology over the past few years has reduced many of these problems.
Tests to date have been small, and none of them has demonstrated the
concept's technical and financial viability.

Administration officials have confirmed that President Bush signed a
secret directive in July 2002 ordering the development of a national

[So, If You Pay the $13, Does That Make Your Downloads All Legal?]
GERMAN TWIST ON COPYRIGHT COMPENSATION
A nonbinding recommendation from the German Patent Office calls for
makers of personal computers to pay copyright owners about $13 (U.S.
dollars) for every PC they sell. The fee is intended to reimburse
copyright owners for the digital copies of copyrighted works that PC
users are likely to make. This latest move in Germany is the first
attempt at levying a copyright fee on computers, though other levies
already exist in some countries on products such as blank compact
discs, recordable digital videodiscs, and CD writers. The new
recommendation comes on behalf of so-called "collecting societies,"
which have been formed to represent copyright owners in ongoing
disputes with hardware manufacturers. Collecting societies endeavor to
collect monies from users or device manufacturers to compensate content
owners for copies that computer users are likely to make but that
otherwise would be subject to royalties. A spokesman for the law firm
representing Fujitsu Siemens said that company, as well as the rest of
the industry, are likely to fight the PC levy in court.

operating system and in Internet Explorer. Judge Frederick Motz, who is

shipping it with its operating system and browser. The U.S. Court of

order to ship Sun's Java should be held until the suit is resolved by
