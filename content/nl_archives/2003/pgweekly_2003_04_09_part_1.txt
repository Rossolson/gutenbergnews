Requests For Assistance:

For me, we'd like to have one of these, will pay for it plus shipping:

For value for money you can't beat the Franklin eBookMan, out of
production but currently on sale in the US for $30 at Fry's. The eBM is
quirky but lovable and has gradually accumulated a reasonable collection
of software in addition to the standard PDA bits and pieces, including
the MobiPocket Reader. Top-end models have a backlit screen. Ideal for
beginners. The main drawback is the daft protection system which
requires each individual eBM to be separately registered with Franklin
before it can be used - so no in-store demos, and if you lose the
operating system you've got to go online on your own PC to download it
again. It supports MMC cards but not Sdata.

Project Gutenberg--Canada will be starting up soon,

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Here Are The Updated Listings For This Week

Statistical Review

In the 6 weeks of this year, we have produced 358 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1995 to produce our FIRST 358 eBooks!!!

         That's 6 WEEKS as Compared to 24 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 7,101 eBooks online as of February 12, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.41 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.19 when we had 4559 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing $.78 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

[My Comments In Brackets]


[Now THIS is NEWS!]

LOW-BUDGET MAC CLONE
Businessman John Fraser has developed a low-budget entry-level Macintosh
clone (currently called iBox); it will sell for about $650 without a display
and can be paired with almost any kind of display: large or small, flat
panel or picture-tube, new or old. Fraser, who is about as polite
businessman as you could ever find, says: "Before I'm a businessman, I'm a
Mac lover. I don't want to hurt Apple. If it says I would do that, I will
back away." He's already volunteering to rename his product, to avoid
confusion with Apple's iMac or iPod. What a guy. (San Jose Mercury News 7

YAHOO REVAMPS SEARCH ENGINE
Yahoo is touting its new, improved search engine, which it hopes will lure
users away from rival/business partner Google. Yahoo says the rebuilt
version will combine Google's index with Yahoo's customized services
spanning sports, driving directions and weather reports, and is designed to
provide easier access to more useful information than Google. "We think
this is going to change the game a bit," says Yahoo senior VP Jeff Weiner.
"This is the first of many steps toward reinforcing our leadership in the
marketplace." Battle lines are being drawn between the two companies, says
Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Watch. "They are going to be duking
it out. Clearly, Yahoo would like to keep more people from going over to
Google to search and maybe even bring back some of the people that have
previously left." After encouraging Google's founders and licensing its
search technology, Yahoo has found that Google's popularity has eroded its
own user base: Google now fields an average of 112 million searches a day
vs. Yahoo's 42 million. To lessen its dependence on Google, Yahoo recently
bought search engine specialist Inktomi and plans to include some of its
features in its search engine by year's end. (AP 7 Apr 2003)

[Will it call you when dinner is ready?]

MICROWAVE DOUBLES AS FRIDGE WHILE YOU'RE AT WORK
Descriptions of futuristic remote-controlled kitchen appliances have always
seemed a little impractical because it's unsafe to leave your dish
unrefrigerated all day before cooking it in time for dinner. But a company
called Tonight's Menu Intelligent Ovens has solved that dilemma with a
refrigerated microwave that can be controlled by a cell phone or over the
Internet. The company has unveiled a prototype to demonstrate the
technology, using what is called a Peltier cooling device. "It has two
plates of metal over which you pass an electrical current and it either
heats or cools," says TMIO president David Mansbery. "It was somewhat of a
dumb appliance until we put our chips in it and turned it into a smart
appliance." The company uses the same embedded Web technology developed by
NASA to control its experiments without the need for a built-in computer in
every device. TMIO plans to build the ovens itself and sell them over the
Web. The first appliances should be commercially available by the end of
the year priced at about $2,000. (BBC News 6 Apr 2003)

CUSTOM CDs
Sony Music Entertainment has launched a site, www.custommixed.com, where
music lovers will be able to purchase CDs of songs of their choosing from
their favorite artists. A "mixed" CD of this sort will contain up to 12
songs or 78 minutes of music and will cost about $15. Forrester research
music industry analyst Josh Bernoff says, "What consumers have demonstrated
by their use of file-trading services is that they're very interested in
assembling the pieces of music they want from a wide variety of sources for
use in whatever format they want. What they're not willing to do is back up
and have only certain stuff from certain artists from certain labels." (New
York Times 7 Apr 2003

NEW SEARCH ENGINE FROM YAHOO TARGETS GOOGLE
In an effort to become the most widely used Internet search resource,
Yahoo is offering a new search engine promoted as more powerful and
easier to use than Google's. The new version will combine Google's
index with Yahoo's customized services for sports, weather reports,
and the like. Industry analysts expect a struggle for dominance to
ensue between Yahoo and Google. Currently Google handles an average of
112 million searches a day compared to Yahoo's 42 million, which are
generated by Google's software. Yahoo supported Google's creation and
licensed its software three years ago for searches on Yahoo's portal.
To wean itself from Google, Yahoo purchased Inktomi and will use its
search-engine tools instead.

NATIONAL ARCHIVE DOCUMENTS GO ONLINE
Fifty million historical records in the National Archives are now
available online. Instead of visiting the Archives or requesting
records by phone, researchers, genealogists, and others can now search
for records ranging from the details of battles to immigration
information remotely and free of charge. Veterans in particular are
expected to welcome the system to search for information on military
action, casualties, and prisoners of war. The database of searchable
records contains only a small portion of the archive's electronic
holdings and is compiled from 20 federal agencies. To ensure their
integrity, the records from the different agencies have not been
altered, so some contain typographical and historical errors.

ENGINEER DESIGNS MAC CLONE
The last time anyone produced an Apple clone was in 1997, when Apple
ended a three-year licensing program. John Fraser, an engineer in
Minnesota, hopes to change that with an Apple clone he has designed,
called the iBox. The iBox, which some have likened to a pizza box in
appearance, is made of a case Fraser designed with components built by
Apple that are sold to repair shops as spare parts. Fraser's plan is
to offer customers many options for configuring the iBox, including
processor speed, hard-drive size, and other pieces. Unlike the current
iMac and eMac choices from Apple, the iBox can be substantially
upgraded. Customers will provide the Macintosh operating system. Fraser
hopes his approach to building clones will avoid licensing or patent
problems, but those questions have yet to be answered. Intellectual
property lawyer Mark Dickson noted there is a wide range of trademarks
and patents that must be observed. He said the look of the machine or
how the pieces are put together could be grounds for legal action if
they fall under patents held by Apple or possibly even by another PC maker.
