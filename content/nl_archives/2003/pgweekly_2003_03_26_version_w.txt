EDITORIAL (?):

Due to unknown technical difficulties, and the fact that Michael Hart
is still on vaction in Hawaii, this week's Project Gutenberg Newsletter
wasn't sent out.  This edition of the newsletter is being sent out to
provide the listing of new eBooks posted thus past week, as well as
corrections, updates and new formats of previous postings. Also, to
update everyone on the progress of Project Gutenberg as we add to our
ever-growning collection.

Due to these circumstances, this week's edition will be relatively
brief compared to what you usually receive.  If there are any
announcements or requests that are missing and absolutely should have
gone out with this newsletter, please let us know, and we can send out
a brief update.

The collection is fast approaching 7,500 postings.  A couple of this
week's highlights include more Illustrated works of Mark Twain from
David Widger, and he also continues his postings of the works of
Edward Bulwer-Lytton.

One of the many things I was taught many years ago in journalism class
was that something should be included for all readers.  So, for those of
you who like to find errors, be certain that we have scattered at least
a few in this week's edition.  Enjoy!

I'm pretty certain this is the only edition of the newsletter you'll
be receiving this week.  But you never know! <g>

This week's guest (ghost?) editor.

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list: http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

    eBook community.

 From Newsscan:

ONLINE ADVERTISING STAGING COMEBACK
Market research firm Nielsen/NetRatings has reported that the top 100
traditional advertisers of such products as household good and automobiles
bought more than 30% of all banner-type online ads in 2002, twice as much as
they bought in 2002. The three greatest beneficiaries of this surge were the
Yahoo, AOL, and MSN portals. Charles Buchwalter of Nielsen/NetRatings says:
"The lion's share of the cautious optimism that's being felt through the
online space is due largely to the traditional advertisers who are learning
to reach critical segments who spend their time online. That's the future of
this industry." (Wall Street Journal 19 Mar 2003)

SUPER DIGITAL WATERMARK IN THE WORKS
SunnComm Technologies is working with Stealth MediaLabs to develop a kind
of super-watermark that could be embedded inside digital music files and
would be robust enough to withstand digital compression, or being recorded
off the radio or rerecorded through an analog connection. The technology,
originally developed at the University of Miami, could also be used to
embed other information. "The intention was for protecting the security of
intellectual property. Adding pictures and liner notes inside a song is
kind of a byproduct," says SunnComm COO Bill Whitmore. The technology works
by encoding binary data inside the stereo audio signal itself, taking
advantage of acoustical properties and human hearing characteristics to
make it imperceptible to the listener. Because the signal is embedded in
the sound itself, the data is hard to remove without significantly changing
the sound of the song. SunnComm plans initially to market the
super-watermark technology to record labels, which could use it to detect
which recipients of advance discs are putting songs online before the
albums' official release dates. "With that anonymity gone, people will be
less willing to put advance songs on file-sharing networks," says Whitmore.

ONE CHARGER FITS ALL
A UK startup called SplashPower has developed a technology that can
wirelessly charge any handheld gadget, including mobile phones, MP3 players
and PDAs, simply by placing them on a small flat mat that's plugged into
the wall. "You pick up your phone, drop it on the pad and it charges. The
pad does all the thinking for you," says SplashPower VP David Whitewood.
The system is based on the principle of magnetic inductive power transfer
and works by generating a magnetic field which transfers energy into any
gadget equipped with a special SplashPower module. That in turn transforms
the energy into the direct current that the battery uses to recharge. The
company says the cost of adding SplashPower technology to a handheld device
will cost only about 25 cents each, and points out that the benefits for
manufacturers could be considerable. "You don't have to put a charger in
every box if you implement SplashPower in your products," says Whitewood,
"and there's a green pay-off in that. Every time you change your mobile
phone, you perhaps keep your charger in a drawer or throw it away. With
SplashPower you wouldn't have to do that." (BBC News 21 Mar 2003)

NEW ICANN CHIEF TO CONTINUE POLICY FOCUS
Succeeding Stuart Lynn as CEO of the often-controversial Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), in-coming chief Paul
Twomey says that in addition to focusing on technical coordination, the
organization will also have to continue its efforts to deal with the policy
issues such as intellectual property, privacy, and law enforcement: "The
consequences of those technical issues flow into other arenas, like
intellectual property, consumer protection, and privacy, potentially even
into commercial relationships between infrastructure providers. The law
enforcement issues are potentially issues like identification for Whois
databases (which list information on domain name owners), identification of
those people who are committing computer crimes, (and) ensuring that
financial scams don't take place on the Internet." Twomey, an Australian,
has been a consultant and government bureaucrat. (CNet News.com 19 Mar 2003)

NEW ANTI-SPAM SYSTEM BEING DEVELOPED
A California start-up company created by well-known software designer Phil
Goldman (formerly of Apple, General Magic, WebTV and Microsoft) has
designed an e-mail service that takes a "challenge-response" approach to
blocking spam. When a user receives a bulkmail message from an unknown
source the system intercepts the message and requires the sender to give
indication (by filling out a form) that the message is not an instance of
spam. The service will cost $9.95 a year, so Forrester Research analyst Jim
Nail note skeptically: "It's a really nice product, and it's pretty easy to
use. The question is how big a market. Do people want to pay anybody
anything for these features?" (New York Times 24 Mar 2003)

REPORT SHOWS SHRINKING DIGITAL DIVIDE
A report released March 19 indicates that the digital divide in the
United States is shrinking as children from all ethnic groups and
income levels increasingly use the Internet. The Corporation for Public
Broadcasting reported that children under 17 spend nearly as much time
using computers as watching television, with Internet use among
minority and low-income children surging over the past two years. More
than two-thirds of low-income households have a computer at home,
compared to fewer than half two years ago. Gaps persist, however,
particularly with respect to high-speed Internet access at home.
