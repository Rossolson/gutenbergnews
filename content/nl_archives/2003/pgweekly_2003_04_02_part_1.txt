***The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, April 2, 2003***
******eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Over 31 Years******

*A personal Newsletter from Michael S. Hart, Founder of Project Gutenberg*


               ***7,500 eBooks from Project Gutenberg***   !!!


Over Our 31 3/4 Year History, We Have Now Averaged About 200 Ebooks/Year--
And Last Year Averaged About That Same 200 eBook Level. . .PER MONTH!!!!!


             This Year We Have Averaged Over 250 Per Month!!!


This past week we provided 86 new eBooks, and our total is now over 7,550
as most of you read this, and we are still accelerating!

Our weekly averages:

57.40 January
62.25 Februry
67.25 March

Monthly Average is 268.33

That average would get us to 9,964 by the end of the year.

We will continue to accelerate, and I just bet Charles Franks a dinner
that we will make #10,000 in November. . .he said December. . . !

Of course, since we did #5,000 last April 10th, we would have to get
to #10,000 by October 10th, to keep up with Moore's Law, so there is
certainly plenty for us to strive for as we close in on #10,000!!!

October, November or December. . .it looks like 2003 will be the big
year for Project Gutenberg's 10,000th eBook. . .

and

WE OWE IT ALL TO YOU!!!

***Many, Many Thanks To All The Project Gutenberg Volunteers***


Michael

***

We will soon be starting a public relations campaign to promote PG's
arrival at the 10,000 eBook mark and to get these 10,000 eBooks to a
wider readership than just the 1.5% we have been targeting.

If you can find contact information for the major media:  snailmail,
phone, email, etc., please send them for inclusion in this effort.

***

We will be making some changes as we pass the 10,000 eBook mark and
head off on our mission to get to 1,000,000.  Stay tuned to these
Project Gutenberg Newsletters to find our more about these updates,
and please send in your own suggestions of what we should do after
we reach #10,000.
