I need a copy of zip for AIX that can do the "-9" high compression,
and still unzip via the standard unzip programs!!!

I am working on trying to collect and convert some public domain folk tunes
to ABC notation.  Could use some help tracking down public domain versions
of the melodies or proof that these songs are in the public domain.  Songs
I'm working on at present include:
I Know Where I'm Going
Simple Gifts
She Moved Throught The Fair
A Sailor Courted a Farmer's Daughter (aka Constant Lovers)
The Fisher Who Died in His Bed
Ufros Alienu
If anyone's interesting in converting folk songs to a digital public
domain format and would like to help or if you want to contact me, you can
do so through the mailing list at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pdsongs

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test DVD here right now!!!  Nearly all
of our first 9,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have

if you can help.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://gutenberg.net/list.html  can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer.


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 42 weeks of this year, we have produced 3325 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3325 eBooks!!!

         That's 42 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With  10,068 eBooks online as of October 22, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.99 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.62 when we had 6108 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing $.63 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 10,070 eBooks in 32 Years and 4.60 Months We Averaged
      309 Per Year   [We do more per month these days!]
       25 Per Month
      .81 Per Day

At 3,325 eBooks Done In The 294 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     11.3 Per Day
     79.1 Per Week
    346.4 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.


***Headline News***

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


From Newsscan:

APPLE iTUNES DOES WINDOWS
Apple is expanding its popular iTunes music download service into Windows
territory, promising a wider selection of songs and some new features to
maintain its lead in an increasingly competitive market. The launch was
accompanied by the usual Apple glitz -- CEO Steve Jobs chatted via remote
link-up with U2 lead man Bono and the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger in a
prelude to a live performance by singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan. "It's
like the pope of software meeting up with the Dali Lama of integration,"
gushed Bono -- referring to the iTunes software and Apple's integrated
online music store. Analysts say that iTunes faces stiff competition in the
Windows space, but that its flexibility to download tunes onto multiple
devices gives it an edge. "There's going to be a lot of jockeying for
position in the next 12 months," says a Forrester Research analyst. "But I
think iTunes is a real winner because it has the portable player, the
jukebox and the store all together." (Reuters 16 Oct 2003)

INTEL TO CALIFORNIA: WE'RE OUTTA HERE
Intel chief executive Craig Barnett says his company -- one of the biggest
success stories of California's Silicon Valley -- has ruled out any plans
to expand in that state, because of what he characterized as 20 years of
political mismanagement of the California economy. "California has to treat
business as something it has to attract and nurture." Over the past decade,
Oregon has displaced California as the state with the largest number of
Intel employees, and Arizona now has more Intel employees than Silicon
Valley, where the company's headquarters remain. Barrett notes  that, while
much of the world seeks to lure high-tech businesses, California is focused
on providing  support to such "19th century" industries as agriculture,
steel and shrimp farming. He also pointed out that India, China and Russia
alone now have somewhere between 250 million and 500 million highly
educated knowledge workers between them, a number that surpasses not just
the population of California but that of the entire U.S. (Reuters/21 Oct 2003)

CHALLENGE TO THE WEB WEAVED BY MICROSOFT
The U.S. Justice Department and 19 states have complained to U.S. District
Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly about a design feature of Windows that compels
consumers who buy music online to use only Microsoft's Internet Explorer
browser and guides them to a Microsoft Web site. The dispute may become the
first test of the Microsoft antitrust settlement approved by a federal
court in October 2002. In response, a Microsoft executive said, "We believe
that the use of Internet Explorer by the Shop-for-Music-Online link in
Windows is consistent with the design rules established by the consent
decree, and we will continue to work with the government to address any
concerns. At issue is a design feature in Windows XP called "Shop for Music
Online," which lets consumers purchase compact discs from retailers over
the Internet, but when consumers click the link to buy music, Windows opens
Microsoft's browser software even if consumers have indicated that they
prefer using rival browser software. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 20 Oct 2003)

MICROSOFT TOUTS SELF-DESTRUCTING E-MAIL
Microsoft's new Office 2003 software, set to debut on Tuesday, will include
an e-mail feature that can be used to time-stamp messages, directing them
to delete themselves on a certain date. In addition, senders will be able
to restrict forwarding and printing of messages by the recipient. The new
Information Rights Management software could run into opposition from U.S.
regulators, who view destroying e-mail as on a par with shredding
documents. Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley was fined $1.65 million for
failing to keep e-mail records, despite the company's claim that it due to
oversight rather than a deliberate attempt to evade financial
investigation. (BBC News 19 Oct 2003)

INTERCEPTING E-MAIL IS A CRIME
An Arizona woman was sentenced to 60 days of home detention for
intercepting at least 215 e-mail messages directed to her husband's
ex-wife. Law enforcement officials said Angel Lee fraudulently obtained the
ex-wife's user name and password, allowing her to log in and read mail.
Ex-wife Duongladde Ramsey said Lee's actions were comparable to breaking
into her house and reading her diary, and the judge agreed, saying Lee's
penalty is a warning to others who might be tempted to spy on others'
e-mail accounts. "Privacy is still a cherished value," said U.S. District
Judge Richard P. Matsch. (AP 19 Oct 2003)

INFO TECHNOLOGY HELPS WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS
The overall number of microbusinesses (companies with no paid employees)
increased by 9% between 1997 and 2001, and the number of those owned by
women increased by 14% over the same few years. By exploiting such
technology as PCs, fax machines, and color printers to start
information-based companies, women are changing the face of traditional
mom-and-pop ventures. "This is definitely not your father's small
business," says consultant Terri Lonier. Information technology has
liberated many women who want to leave corporate jobs for self-employment
in the same field. One example of the trend: Jennifer Lawson, who started a
TV production consulting firm in her Washington home, equipped with
video-screening equipment. Another: Jaime Caris of Las Vegas, who has
become a virtual administrative assistant, offering clients across the U.S.
assistance with word processing, accounting and other services from her
home office. (AP/USA Today 19 Oct 2003)

VERISIGN SHEDS NETWORK SOLUTIONS
VeriSign is selling its Network Solutions domain registrar business to
Pivotal Private Equity for about $100 million, but plans to retain control
over the .com and .net database that Network Solutions operates. The domain
registration business has essentially become a commodity service as more
registrars have entered the field. VeriSign has been in the news recently
for its controversial Site Finder service, which redirects all mistyped
URLs to a search page that it operates. It suspended the service under
pressure from ICANN, which expressed concern over the technical
ramifications of the Site Finder service, but VeriSign said Wednesday that
it plans to restart the service after having found "no identified security
or stability problems" in the system. (CNet News.com 16 Oct 2003)

TEXT-SEARCHING OR TEXT-MINING?
Whereas Google and other Web search engines retrieve information and
display links to documents that contain certain keywords, text-mining
programs dig deeper in order to categorize information, make links between
seemingly unconnected documents, and provide visual maps that lead down new
pathways of exploratory learning. Unlike data mining, text mining works on
unstructured data -- such as e-mail messages, news articles, internal
reports, phone call transcripts, and so on. A good example of the problem
it seeks to solve is suggested by the comment of researcher Randall S.
Murch, who says: "I was an FBI agent for 20 years. And I have yet to see
anyone who is able to model the way an agent thinks and works through an
investigation." And a good example of the solution offered by text-mining
is its use in the 1980s University of Chicago information scientist Don R.
Swanson in studying the medical literature on migraines. Starting with the
word "migraine," he downloaded abstracts from 2,500 articles from Medline
and noticed a reference to a neural phenomenon called "spreading
depression" -- which prompted him to look for articles with that term in
their titles, which in turn led him to the discovery that magnesium was
often mentioned as preventing this spreading depression. Thus, as a result
of text-mining he was able to hypothesize a link between headaches and
magnesium deficiency -- a link that was later confirmed by actual
experiments.  (New York Times  16 Oct 2003)

[TeraBYTES Compared To GigaBITS. . .Didn't Those People Learn UNITS???]
[That's .5+ GigaBYTES per second. . .meaning it took ~2 kiloseconds, or
over half an hour. . .no WONDER they didn't want to be specific. . . ;-)]

RESEARCH CENTERS SET NEW RECORD FOR SPEEDY DATA TRANSFER
Two of the world's top research centers -- CERN (the European Organization
for Nuclear Research) and the California Institute of Technology -- say
they've set a new world record for speed in sending data across the
Internet: 1.1 terabytes at 5.44 gigbits per second. That's more than 20,000
times as fast as a typical home broadband connection and would be
equivalent to sending a full-length DVD in seven seconds. The previous top
speed -- 2.38 gigabits per second -- was achieved last February by a joint
team from CERN, Caltech, Los Alamos and Stanford. (Wired.com 15 Oct 2003)

APPLE EXPANDS INTO WINDOWS MUSIC
Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Thursday unveiled his company's
expansion of its iTunes music service to include Windows computers.
Jobs also announced deals Apple has struck with America Online (AOL)
and PepsiCo. Under the first arrangement, AOL will direct users of its
music site to Apple's iTunes store, where they can purchase music with
their AOL memberships. Jobs and AOL CEO Jonathan Miller said the deal
was "exclusive." PepsiCo and Apple will launch a marketing campaign
that features 100 million free iTunes songs, given away through special
caps on PepsiCo bottles. Apple's iTunes has been extremely successful
as a Macintosh-based service, and Jobs said the company has sold 1.4
million of its iPod music players. With the Windows-based version of
its service, Apple will compete with online music services including
RealNetworks, MusicNet, and BuyMusic.com.

QUICK START FOR WINDOWS ITUNES
Early reports from Apple Computer's foray into Windows-based online
music indicate exuberance among consumers for the company's iTunes
service. Apple has sold more than one million songs to iTunes for
Windows customers since the service was launched last week, and
computer users have reportedly downloaded more than one million copies
of the Windows version of iTunes software in the past three days. Apple
launched iTunes for Macintosh-based computers in April of this year,
and since then the company has sold 14 million songs at 99 cents each.
The company said it hopes to have sold 100 million songs by the first
anniversary of the service next April.

[Of Course, No Mention That There Was No Evidence That HE Did It, Either]

HACKER'S ACQUITTAL RAISES CONCERNS OVER TROJAN HORSE DEFENSE
Some security experts fear that a British teen's acquittal on charges
of hacking into the computer system of the port of Houston will weaken
future prosecutions of computer crimes. Aaron Caffrey was charged with
a 2001 attack that left the port's computer system crippled. Although
Caffrey acknowledged that the attack originated from his computer, he
argued in court that a trojan horse program had been installed on his
computer without his knowledge. That application, Caffrey insisted,
allowed someone to remotely launch the attack from his computer.
Although no evidence of such an application was found on Caffrey's
computer, the jury ruled in his favor. Graham Cluley, senior technology
consultant for Sophos, said of the jury's decision that even without
evidence of a trojan horse application, defendants in similar cases
"might still be able to successfully claim that they were not
responsible for what their computer does."

[It's OK For Academics To Look At This Information, Just Not OK For YOU]


COMPROMISE REACHED ON DATABASE-PROTECTION BILL
A House of Representatives subcommittee has passed a bill that would
extend strong intellectual-property protections to databases after
opposition from three academic groups was withdrawn. The Database and
Collections of Information Misappropriation Act, introduced last week
by Howard Coble (R-N.C.), had stirred objections from academic groups,
which saw it as a threat to researchers. The original version of the
bill included a vague exception for academics, but the version that
passed the subcommittee this week has a much stronger exception.
According to the revised bill, "no liability shall be imposed under
this act" on higher education and research institutions or their
employees. With that language, the Association of American
Universities, the American Council on Education, and the National
Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges have ended
their opposition to the bill and assumed a neutral position. Other
groups, including the National Academies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
and academic-library organizations, continue to oppose the bill.

FEDS SEEK REVERSAL OF COMPUTER ADMINISTRATOR'S CONVICTION
Federal prosecutors have asked an appeals court to overturn the
conviction of Bret McDanel on charges that he intentionally caused
damage to the computer system of his former employer, Tornado
Development Inc.  While an employee of Tornado, McDanel discovered a
flaw that could have compromised customer accounts. He notified the
company, but it refused to fix the flaw. After leaving the company,
McDanel sent several e-mails to customers, warning them of the flaw.
Because the e-mails caused Tornado's computer system to crash and
resulted in monetary losses, McDanel was tried and convicted to 16
months in federal prison. McDanel argued that he did not intend to
cause damage to Tornado's system, and federal prosecutors conceded
they had no evidence that the damage caused was intentional.
Prosecutors have admitted the error and requested that the conviction
be overturned, though McDanel has already served his sentence.
