1) Editorial

Hello,

Slightly quieter this week, with a little cheering as we flash past
8750. Interestingly the pages completed counter over at DP has
recently racked up over 90,000 pages for this month. Their target is
95,010, so this is a real possibility and there is a lot of
excitement. Good luck to them.

Happy reading,

Alice

send does not reach me and disappears into the ether.)

We welcome feedback and awkward questions at the address above. Please
feel free to send our general ramblings to a friend.

Does anyone even read this bit?

Apparently not. I could write utter rubbish here and no-one would
know. Mind you, who would notice the difference!

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

2) News

Newsletter Website Update

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/newsletter/index.html

Added to the website this week, more ebook listings. This time from
March 1995, and two from 1996. This week's hidden gems include a
Beatrix Potter collection, both constitutions of Japan (for those who
don't know, the constitution of Japan was changed in 1946), and a
rather interesting item entitled 'CodexJunius 11', which is a
selection of translated Anglo-Saxon poetry. Whilst looking for it in
the alphabetical index I noticed the item above was entitled 'Code of
Honor, The, Or Rules For The Government Of Principles And Seconds In
Duelling'. You never get bored here at PG.

Review: Things Mother Used To Make by Lydia Maria Gurney 

Now, it's not often I get a new book to review here at the newsdesk
(for the pedantic, it's a table, but let's leave that to one side). So
when the message hit my inbox with a small beep earlier this week I
was intrigued.

The book was originally published in 1914 and includes recipes that at
the time were one hundred years old. There are also useful household
hints and tips, that tend to get forgotten and made redundant over the
years.

The recipes start with a selection of breads and then range through
cakes, desserts, candies and the essential instructions for how to
boil an egg! As the book is aimed at 'those who have had no
experience, no practice and possibly have little judgment', this
shouldn't be a surprise. There are also instructions for growing yeast
and making pickles, activities that are reviving in the UK at the
moment (well, at least they are in this house).

A fascinating set of recipes is followed by an appendix which provides
an amazing insight into daily life at the beginning of the last
century, such as plans of the working week:

Monday--Wash, if you have it done in the house. If sent out, use
that day for picking up and putting things in order, after the disorder
of Sunday.

Tuesday--Iron.

Wednesday--Finish ironing and bake; wash kitchen floor.

Thursday, Friday--Sweep and dust, thoroughly.

Saturday--Bake, and prepare in every way possible, for the
following day.

There are instructions for making tea and coffee, making use of old
underclothes, cleaning zinc and copper along with a great many others.

Altogether a really good read if you want something short to browse
and are interested in how we used to live. If you want to know how to
make your broom last longer, the best way to stop an iron sink
rusting or how to sweep a room, this is the book to go for.

New and Improved service

In a bid to make the newsletter more helpful to readers who may be
blind or visually impaired and using screen reading software, we are
now able to offer the booklisting normally contained in part 3 in a 
different format to make your life a little easier. An example of the
new style listing is given below. If you would like either a daily or
weekly version of this list please email me at newsletter at
schiffwood dot co dot uk, and state which version you require. 

{Note to the unwary: this is an example, the real booklist is in part 3.}

Archive Foundation, which oversees financial and organizational
aspects of Project Gutenberg.  Greg's volunteer role of CEO
follows increasing responsibilities for Project Gutenberg since
1991, when he first met Michael Hart in Urbana, Illinois.  He

Request for sponsorship

From Ted Garvin

There are some books of historical/literary significance that I would
like to get through ILL (Inter Library Loans). Only one problem (aside
from finding time to scan them, but I seem to manage in that area),
and that is lack of funds.

So this is a plea for sponsorship. Email Ted at garvint at yahoo.com

                    -------------------

Tabloid Scanning Now Available.

Project Gutenberg has purchased a tabloid-sized flatbed scanner,
capable of scanning pages up to 12" by 17" (30cm x 42.5cm). Do you
have a book, magazine, sheet music, or broadside that requires an
oversized scanner?

E-mail Suzanne Shell at shells at pglaf dot org to discuss the
details.

It would be helpful to include the following in your message:
Title/author, Copyright clearance, Time constraints, Format and/or
image resolution needed (and any other special requirements). The
scanner (and Suzanne) are located in North Carolina; get in
touch--we'll figure out how best to handle your project.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://www.gutenberg.net allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Please visit the site:
http://www.pgdp.net for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

 If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

 Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

********

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time or
technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Send email to
dphelp@pgdp.net saying that you are interested in post-processing and we
will help you find a project to work on.
