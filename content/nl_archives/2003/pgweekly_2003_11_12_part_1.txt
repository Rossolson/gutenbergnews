***  HOT Requests!!!

For those of you who are trying to get some PR for Project Gutenberg,
the UPI said this week:

"These are momentous times in the digital content industry. . . .

"Project Gutenberg - the pioneering and largest depository of free,
mostly "plain-vanilla" (text only) e-books - added the 10,000-th
title to its unsurpassed collection.  In the meantime, e-book
aggregators, such as blackmask.com, now proffer tens of thousands
of free titles for download in up to 8 file formats. Even Microsoft
has spent the last few months offering a free weekly selection of 3
commercial titles each, exclusively readable on its MS-Reader application."

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test 10K Special DVD here right now!!!
Nearly all of our first 10,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have
regular needs for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby <gbnewby AT pglaf.org> ,
if you can help.


*** Progress Report

[Disclaimer:  We have several people and programs who count
up the Project Gutenberg eBooks and help create the statistics
we provide.  Every once in a while these don't agree, and we
have numbers that slightly disagree, even as to the number of
weeks in a given year. . .for example, 2003 has 53 Wednesdays,
so we will have 53 Newsletters, and thus will count 53 weeks,
at least some of us will. . . .   ;-)   This week is unusual,
because we are in the process of reestablishing our databases
after reaching eBook #10,000 a few weeks ago, and the programs
are not yet back to running at full capacity.  Thus, we have
had several mere mortals counting up the books and disagreeing
on how many there are.  I counted 87, George counted 84, and
one day we didn't get any reports at all, so we could both be
somewhat off.  Hopefully next week we will get back to normal.]

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???


Statistical Review

In the 45 weeks of this year, we have produced 3570 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2002 to produce our FIRST 3570 eBooks!!!

         That's 45 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With 10,313 eBooks online as of November 12, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.97 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.59 when we had 6297 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing $.62 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 10,313 eBooks in 32 Years and 4.25 Months We Averaged
      319 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       27 Per Month
      .87 Per Day

At 3,570 eBooks Done In The 315 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     11.3 Per Day
     79.3 Per Week
    348.3 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


From Newsscan:

FTC TAKES AIM AT MESSENGER POP-UPS
The Federal Trade Commission has obtained a temporary restraining order
against D Squared Solutions, accusing it of "high-tech extortion" for its
annoying marketing campaign, which bombards Microsoft Windows users with
pop-up ads touting its $29.95 pop-up blocker software designed to prevent
such intrusions. The company set out "to create a problem for consumers and
then try to charge them for a solution," said Howard Beales, head of the
FTC's consumer protection unit. The FTC is seeking to recoup "hundreds of
thousands" of dollars that beleaguered consumers paid to D Squared
Solutions for the ad-blocking software. The ads take advantage of a
security feature in Microsoft's Windows Messenger service that was
originally designed to enable corporate network administrators to send
internal messages. These messages are different from the ones imposed on
users who visit a Web site, said Beales. "What we are challenging is this
'backdoor' kind of advertising, particularly when it is done in a way and
with a frequency that threatens to impair consumers' ability to use their
computers." (Los Angeles Times 7 Nov 2003)

PENN STATE STUDENTS BLAST NAPSTER DEAL
Pennsylvania State University is catching flak for yesterday's announced
deal to provide all students with access to Napster's revamped
music-subscription service, paid for by the university's existing
information technology fees. The school had viewed the university-wide
arrangement as a way to circumvent the music download controversy and
provide students with a legal alternative, but some students say they
resent this use of their funds. "The money I pay could go to much better
things such as rebuilding the network or better lab equipment," says one
disgruntled student. "Almost every single student I have talked to is
outraged that their money is going to a program that they don't even want^E
(and that) their money is being sent to the music industry without their
consent." Penn State president Graham Spanier said he had not personally
received any complaints about the new deal and that students didn't protest
over cable TV service and newspaper subscriptions, which were also covered
by mandatory student fees. (CNet News.com 6 Nov 2003)

[Why Is It So Hard For MicroSoft NOT To Play MicroHardball???]
[And You Thought This Was Only About People Pointing Nasty Bugs]

OOPS! MICROSOFT DROPS THE BALL ON U.K. HOTMAIL DOMAIN
Microsoft apparently forgot to renew its registration for hotmail.co.uk,
sending the domain name back into the pool of available names. It was
snapped up immediately by a do-gooder, who then contacted Microsoft to
alert it to its oversight and arrange a transfer of ownership back to the
software giant. However, these efforts to do the right thing were rebuffed
and it was only when The Register contacted the company to inquire about
the snafu that the matter was "escalated" to upper-level officials who then
sought to work out a deal. By all accounts, hotmail.co.uk will be restored
to the Microsoft fold within the next few days. (The Register 6 Nov 2003)

TURNER, BARKSDALE UNLOAD TIME WARNER SHARES
Ted Turner, James Barksdale, and two other directors of Time Warner's board
of directors have been heavy sellers of the company's stock this year,
unloading a total of more than 68 million shares. There have been 52
reported sales and 4 purchases of Time Warner stock by corporate officers

Primrose said that the four directors "all continue to have significant
holdings in Time Warner," and that each of them is "pursuing some form of

sale of shares or the exercising of options, which is in keeping with sound
financial practices." (Washington Post 11 Nov 2003)

From Edupage

PENN STATE TO OFFER FREE MUSIC TO STUDENTS FROM NEW NAPSTER
Pennsylvania State University has struck a deal with the recently
launched second-generation Napster to provide online music to all of
the university's students, faculty, and staff. The university
negotiated a discounted fee from Napster--which otherwise charges $9.95
per month--and will pay the cost of the service out of a mandatory,
$160 information technology fee that students pay each year. Penn State
users will be allowed to download unlimited numbers of songs on up to
three computers. Students who want to keep songs after they have left
Penn State, or users who want to save the songs to CDs, will have to
pay 99 cents per song. Officials and student leaders from Penn State
hope that this approach will appease student demand for online music
while satisfying record companies by using the now-legal Napster
service. Some students expressed reservations that a portion of student
technology fees is being used for online music. Students also said that
the restrictions of the new Napster/Penn State deal will encourage some
to continue using peer-to-peer networks that have no restrictions.

FTC FIGHTS WINDOWS POP-UPS
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) this week shut down a marketer for
taking advantage of a feature of Microsoft Windows to send unwanted
pop-up ads, even to users who were not browsing the Internet. According
to the FTC, D Squared Solutions used a tool called the Windows
Messenger Service--which is enabled by default in Windows systems--to
send pop-up ads selling software to block pop-up ads. Calling such a
tactic extortion, the FTC has temporarily shut down D Squared. The
agency also advised users to disable Windows Messenger, which is not
related to instant-messaging programs. Last month Microsoft recommended
that users disable Windows Messenger as a precaution against the spread
of Internet viruses. Microsoft's Sean Sundwall said the pop-up ads
that take advantage of Windows Messenger do not pose any threat to a
system's security.

Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media

The Grocery Store Employees Union strike and lockout
in California isn't getting much coverage, but the
last time something like this happened, it was with
the Meat Cutters Union.  That event finished up ~10
years ago with a total drop in meat cutters' pay of
30% during a period in which inflation and the cost
of living rose ~10%, leaving the meat cutters with
just over 50% of their original buying power from

The current event has been sparked by fear of the
proposed Wal-Mart expansion that is scheduled to
build some 40 new Wal-Mart Super Centers in the
affected area, which includes 850 grocery stores
that are currently on strike or in lockouts.

Obviously the media DID report on that major high school
drug bust in which a dozen students were handcuffed as
the police ran up and down the halls with guns drawn,
at the request of the school principal.

Amazingly enough, not one single illegal drug was found,
even with the aid of the famous drug sniffing K-9 corps,
nor were any guns found. . .the two stated objectives.

Not even one pill was found from a parent's prescription,
given illegally by a parent to a student for allergies,
or anything else that a parent might give them what was
in a student's legitimate interest, but techinally illegal.
Not even any Viagra was turned up.  [Don't forget the grade
school kid who was kicked out of school for bringing some
just a few days earlier.]

People are asking if a similar surprise bust of school staff
and the police station would have come up so empty handed.

There Oughta Be A Law. . . .

From personal experience I have the following news report:

In trying to buy my tickets to the upcoming December 10 PG
events, I ended up getting tickets from Orbis that had never
even appeared on the screen.  I could see some kind of error
that might have gotten me tickets I had on the screen earlier,
but these were for some other flight than had appeared.  They
were to the right places, but at the wrong times.  I called up
their 800 number immediately, and was told there would be some
serious fees for cancellation, but I managed to get the flights
cancelled without these fees by insisting that I had called in
only a few minutes after the fact.  However, they said they are
going to keep my $800 for 3-4 billing periods on my Visa card.
At the normal Visa rate of 18%, that would be around ~$50.
They just wrote themselves a loan of my $800 for 3-4 months.

There Oughta Be A Law Against This:

Anyone want to inquire with the Federal Trade Commission
or whoever oversees this sort of thing?

They can take your $800 in one second, but it takes 3-4 months
to give it back, even if you call immediately.

Low Cost Jobs Are Filled Outside The U.S. Via "Outsourcing,"
While High Cost Prescriptions Must Be Filled Inside the U.S.

The U.S. goverment encourages your employers to send your jobs
to other countries, but won't allow you fill prescriptions in
other countries. . .insuring ever decreasing big business costs
by cutting hiring inside the U.S., and insuring ever increasing
business big business profits by insisting you pay twice as much
for products sold in the U.S. as they are in Canada.
