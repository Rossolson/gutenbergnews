REMINDER: GUTINDEX Has Moved to Five Digits!

As we have recently posted our first eBook with a five digit eBook number
(#10701), we have made an adjustment to the GUTINDEXes to accomodate this
change. Basically, the alignment of eBook numbers less than 10,000 have
been moved one space to the right.  This change is also reflected in the
eBook listings below.
