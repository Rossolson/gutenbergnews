3) News

Free Computers

Project Gutenberg has received a generous donation of over 20 Pentium
Pro 100 computers.  If you have a need for a computer to do Project
Gutenberg work or can make good use of computers please
let William Fishburne (william.fishburne@verizon.net) know!

The computers are physically in Northern Virginia and if you are not,
it would be necessary for you to arrange for the shipping cost.
Please send in your thoughts and ideas on how PG can make best use
of this dated windfall! =20

These are GREAT for any wordprocessing, etc. . .it's just about exactly
what I am using here,for all my Project Gutenberg work.  However, these
are NOT good for the "bloatware" operating systems and programs if you
are going to reload and reboot a lot. . .takes some real time for this.
However, I scanned the first books I ever OCRed on something much slower.=

Thanks!!!

Please let us know if you can make use of these items, it would be a real=

shame to let them go to waste.

Wives and Daughters - A Review

What a gem! That's what I said to myself when I finished reading Elizabet=
h=20`
Cleghorn Gaskell's last novel, Wives and Daughters. I consider it a must =
for=20
anyone who enjoys Victorian literature or literature of any period in whi=
ch=20
characters are exquisitely drawn in minute detail and become real people.

Wives and Daughters has characterization in spades! At least a dozen=20
characters stand out. Foremost, of course, is the heroine, Molly Gibson -=
=20
intelligent, honest, proper, usually shy but bold when determined - all t=
hat=20
a Victorian heroine should be. The book opens with Molly not quite grown,=
=20
warmly attached to her widowed father, a diligent and warm-hearted countr=
y=20
doctor. During a prolonged visit to the nearby home of Squire Hamley, Mol=
ly=20
becomes attached to and beloved by the Hamley family, including the sons=20
Osborne and Roger.

Stubborn, outspoken Squire Hamley has breeding (his family has owned the=20
estate since before the Norman conquest) but no education and little mone=
y;=20
he expects his sons, especially Osborne, the elder, to marry for wealth a=
nd=20
social position (a theme often explored by Trollope). During Molly's stay=
 at=20
Hamley Hall, her father decides she needs a stepmother, and he marries a=20
widow with a daughter Molly's age. The second Mrs. Gibson, one of the=20
memorable characters in literature, a born schemer and social climber=20
unencumbered by veracity, takes charge of Molly and, in trying to make he=
r=20
into a "lady," makes her life miserable.=20

Mrs. Gibson's daughter Cynthia is all that Molly is not - beautiful,=20
fashionable, flirtatious, and irresistibly attractive to young men. But b=
oth=20
Cynthia and Mr.Osborne Hamley have secrets which are about to blow up. Mo=
lly=20
unintentionally learns the secrets and does her best to put things right.=
 The=20
action takes place in and about a placid country village whose inhabitant=
s=20
are wonderfully described, based on the author's personal experience.

Mrs. Gaskell (as she was called by Victorian readers) died before complet=
ing=20
the last one or two chapters. A modern reader would never know it, but=20
Victorians would have missed the final acknowledgment of love and uniting=
 in=20
marriage required by their customs. Those who saw the magnificent Exxon-M=
obil=20
Masterpiece Theatre dramatization on PBS saw one possible ending, but not=
 the=20
one planned by Mrs. Gaskell.

Elizabeth Gaskell was unusual in many ways by Victorian standards. She an=
d her=20
husband, a Unitarian minister, did not subscribe to the Victorian convict=
ion=20
that women should be subordinated to men. Her novels and short stories, w=
hile=20
portraying Victorian life in accurate detail, explored the relationships =
of=20
men and women, the worth of individuals accorded by character and achieve=
ment=20
as opposed to social rank, and the plight of workers in the new industria=
l=20
society. One of her novels, Ruth, shocked her contemporaries by dealing w=
ith=20
illegitimate pregnancy and its consequences in a society with a dual set =
of=20
behavioral standards.

She left fewer than a dozen novels, by the mid-twentieth century largely=20
forgotten by all but scholars. She has, in modern parlance, been=20
"re-discovered," deservedly, and the quality of her writing has earned he=
r a=20
place among the acknowledged greats of Victorian literature. To me, Wives=
 and=20
Daughters is far more skillfully written and has a better plot than=20
Thackeray's best-known novel, Vanity Fair, and rivals the best of Trollop=
e's=20
bountiful output.

Trust me, and try it!

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can

help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).
