Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to only ONE DVD burner, on a laptop
belonging to a personal friend.  If you have a DVD burner
or plan to get one in the next 6 months, please email me,
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November while
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

We are seeking pro bono or very cheap legal assistance to pursue
Project Gutenberg trademark infringers and similar issues.  Please
email Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com>.

may need more around December 10.]

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 23 weeks of this year, we have produced 1478 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our FIRST 1478 eBooks!!!

         That's 23 WEEKS as Compared to 27 YEARS!!!


With 8,221 eBooks online as of June 11, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.22 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.87 when we had 5355 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing $.65 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 8221 eBooks in ~31 Years and 11.25 Months We Averaged
    257 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     21 Per Month
     .7 Per Day

At 1478 eBooks Done In 2003 We Averaged
      9 Per Day
     64 Per Week
    282 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

[Will They Require RFID Tags Embedded In Your Dog?]
[Your Robot Dog Will Definitely Come With One]

IT'S A RADIO WORLD
Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, has recently told its top supplier
that they'll need to have all their products "chipped" -- i.e., provided
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags that can be tracked by remote
radio receivers for inventory tracking and management. And now Microsoft
has announced that it will develop software and services for RFID
technology, and make its desktop, server and applications software all work
with RFID. (Reuters/Yahoo 10 Jun 2003)

DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING MADE EASY
Berkeley scientist David Anderson has devised a cheaper and easier way to
write distributed computing software, paving the way for more projects that
rely on the combined power of millions of idle computers to seek solutions
to some of life's mysteries -- such as a cure for cancer or whether there's
extraterrestrial life out there. About a dozen research projects now depend
on distributed computing, but up until now the software needed to exploit
the unused power of volunteers' PCs has been expensive and time-consuming
to create. Anderson's open-source software will eliminate those barriers.
"The more projects that start using distributed computing the more people
will be interested in lending their computers for research," says
Anderson.(Popular Science Jun 2003)

ANDREW SULLIVAN SAYS: 'THE INTERNET DID IT'
Prominent blogger-journalist Andrew Sullivan, former editor of the New
Republic magazine, says that the Internet should be given much of the
credit for forcing the resignation of top New York Times editors Howell
Raines and Gerald Boyd: "Only, say, five years ago, the editors of the New
York Times had much more power than they have today. If they screwed up, no
one would notice much. A small correction would be buried days, sometimes
weeks, later... The blogosphere in general created a growing chorus of
criticism that helped create public awareness of exactly what Raines was up
to." Sullivan quotes a letter from one of his readers: "Now in newspaper
journalism, as in so many other traditional industries (real estate,
banking, computers, retail sales, airlines, travel, etc.), we see that the
Internet strips away discretion, power and secrecy. It is very hard to
withstand the forced transparency induced by this new technology." To which
Sullivan adds: "And you ain't seen nothing yet." (The Daily Dish 6 Jun 2003)

PALM BUYS HANDSPRING FOR $192 MILLION
Palm is acquiring struggling Handspring for $192 million in stock in a deal
that reflects the new stark reality of Silicon Valley economics. Back in
its late-2000 heyday, Handspring -- the scrappy upstart founded by Palm
veterans Donna Dubinsky, Jeff Hawkins and Ed Colligan -- was valued at $9.2
billion. Dubinsky will now assume a position on Palm's board, while Hawkins
will become Palm's chief technology officer and Colligan will lead a Palm
division. The deal is expected to boost Palm's presence in the
up-and-coming "smartphone" market -- an area in which Palm has been
conspicuously absent. According to IDC, sales of handheld computers will be
flat this year, while smartphone sales are expected to triple to more than
13 million units. The acquisition will coincide with Palm's official
spinoff of its PalmSource software unit. (Wall Street Journal 5 Jun 2003)

NOVELL CLAIMS UNIX PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS NEVER TRANSFERRED
Conflicting claims of Unix intellectual property ownership have come to
light, with Novell saying it sold SCO Group broad rights to the Unix
operating system but retained the copyrights and patents. According to a
1995 contract, Novell sold "all rights and ownership of Unix and UnixWare"
to SCO's predecessor, the Santa Cruz Operation. But the asset purchase
agreement filed with the SEC specifically excludes "all copyrights" and
"all patents" from the purchase. "This agreement is kind of murky. You end
up with a lot of questions, to put it mildly," says one intellectual
property lawyer. The question of Unix patent and copyright ownership is
central to SCO's attempt to force companies using Linux software to pay
royalties for Unix software code that SCO says was illegally incorporated
into Linux. On May 14, SCO sent letters to 1,500 of the world's largest
corporations warning them that using Linux could open them up to legal
liability for infringement. SCO CEO Darl McBride acknowledged last week
that the contract contained "conflicting statements," but added: "It
doesn't make sense. How would you transfer the product but not have the
copyright attached? That would be like transferring a book but only getting
the cover." Novell CEO Jack Messerman, meanwhile, said his company is
basing future operating system products on Linux: "Novell is an ardent
supporter of Linux and the open-source development community."

[Merger Mania Continues. . .With Some Interesting Twists]

TECH CONSOLIDATION ON THE HORIZON?
Oracle's hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft is a harbinger of things to
come, say many analysts, who've been watching for signs of an impending
consolidation in the software market. "This is the first week of what will
be a decade of consolidation in the applications space," says a Banc of
America securities analyst. "The large suite vendors are going to get
larger and stronger, and everyone else is going to get weaker. If
stand-alone firms are attractive, they'll be swallowed." Experts say Oracle
CEO Larry Ellison's surprise move is a shrewd one -- one that will benefit
his company whether or not he actually makes the acquisition. If the deal
goes through, Oracle will surpass Microsoft in the market for
business-application software, and if it's rebuffed (as expected), Oracle
may still succeed in sowing doubt among PeopleSoft's customers following
Ellison's pledge to stop selling PeopleSoft's HR management software.
Either way, Oracle has thrown a potential monkeywrench into PeopleSoft's
plans to acquire J.D. Edwards. If PeopleSoft backs out, Oracle may snap up
J.D. Edwards for itself, and if Oracle's bid for PeopleSoft doesn't pan
out, it's rumored that No. 1 business applications maker SAP might make a
play for it. (Los Angeles Times 10 Jun 2003)

FTC ASKS FOR NEW POWERS TO FIGHT SPAM
U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chairman Timothy Muris is asking Congress to
broaden the FTC's authority to investigate and prosecute spammers. The
request follows congressional hearings on the subject and an FTC study
concluding that two-thirds of spam is fraudulent or misleading. Meanwhile,
several bills to fight spam have been introduced in Congress, the
frontrunner of which is sponsored by Rep. W.J. Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Tauzin's proposed legislation
would require e-mail marketers to reveal their true e-mail addresses, honor
consumer requests to be removed from mailing lists, and require that
p*ornographic spam be labeled as such. The bill would authorize ISPs, state
attorneys general and federal law-enforcement officials to track down
suspected spammers and would allow fines up to $1.5 million and jail time
up to two years for guilty parties. Consumer groups have criticized the
Tauzin bill, saying it would override tougher state laws and is full of
loopholes. (Wall Street Journal 11 Jun 2003)

[Hollywood Rules. . .Or Is It "Hollywood Rules?"]

REPLAYTV BLINKS IN FIGHT WITH HOLLYWOOD & NETWORKS
When Digital Networks North America acquired the ReplayTV brand from
SonicBlue, it evidently decided to establish better relations with the film
and TV industries, which had sued SonicBlue because ReplayTV allowed
consumers to skip commercials (offending the TV industry) and sharing
movies with friends (offending the movie industry). And so the latest
version of ReplayTV's digital video recorder comes without the "automatic
commercial advance" and the "send show" features. Phillip Swann of
TVPredictions.com says that the moves indicate "a whole new approach to
marketing ReplayTV. It's a smart one -- at least it's a heck of a lot
smarter than what the previous regime was doing." Others are less happy.
Gwen Hinze of the Electronic Frontier Foundation sees what's happening as
blows to both consumers and innovators: "There's a pretty clear message
being sent that Hollywood can dictate what technologies consumers can and
cannot use. What we are concerned about is there's little room for
technological innovation." (San Jose Mercury News 11 Jun 2003)

WAL-MART LAUNCHES ONLINE DVD RENTALS
Wal-Mart has launched its online DVD rental business, in a move that pits
it head-to-head against similar offerings from Netflix and Blockbuster. A
Netflix spokeswoman said she thought Wal-Mart and Blockbuster would end up
battling for the No. 2 spot, noting that her company had already signed up
1 million customers. "We're not sure what Wal-Mart has, but we're sure it's
a fraction of that. Until Wal-Mart hits 100,000 they won't be a threat,"
she added. The Wal-Mart service will feature 13,000 titles, which customers
can browse through and order online. The DVDs will then be shipped from
distribution points in Arkansas, California, Georgia, Indiana, Nevada and
New York, ensuring two-day delivery to 90% of the U.S. Pricing plans start
at $15.54 a month for unlimited rentals with a maximum of two movies out at
a time. To keep three or four movies the monthly fees rise to $18.76 and
$21.94, respectively. (AP 10 Jun 2003)

INTEL: FOLLOW THE MARKETS (AND GO EAST)
Since the fastest-growing markets for Intel chips are India, China, Russia,
Eastern Europe and South America, Intel president and chief operating
officer Paul Otellini says that's where new development centers will be
located: "Our resources will go where our markets are." The company will be
investing in a software development hub in Bangalore and expanding its
staff in India to 3,000. Otellini explains: "We can access incredible
talent for software engineering in India. To get these skills, we may not
be able to hire and train people quickly in the United States."

JUDGES UPHOLD PHONE-NUMBER PORTABILITY
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled against
Verizon Wireless and a cell phone trade group, upholding a rule passed
by the Federal Communications Commission that allows cell phone
consumers to change carriers but keep their phone numbers. Wireless
carriers had argued that the rule was unnecessary, but the judges
concluded that having to change a phone number constituted a
significant barrier to changing carriers. The Cellular
Telecommunications and Internet Association, which had challenged the
rule, said it was disappointed with the appellate court ruling.
Land-line phone carriers are already required to allow customers to
keep phone numbers when they change carriers.

[If It Were Students' Grades Or Scholarship Info, Would They Shut Down?]

ROGUE E-MAILS AT STANFORD CIRCULATE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
The rapidly spreading Bugbear.B computer virus hit Stanford University,
randomly sending out files from campus PCs, including highly confidential
information about employee salaries and bonuses. Some within Stanford's
35,000 user computer system received rogue e-mail generated by the virus,
including Chris Handley, who directs the campus computer system.
Handley's team subsequently intercepted messages containing salary
and bonus information. Although it is not known if the e-mails were
read by those outside Stanford, Handley made the decision to block
outgoing e-mails. Handley called the president of the university
to inform him that network would be down until the problem is resolved.

FEDERAL DO-NOT-CALL LIST CLOSE TO LAUNCH
Officials from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) now say that the
federal do-not-call registry will be available on or before July 1,
almost two months earlier than the agency had previously predicted.
Eileen Harrington of the FTC said, "We initially thought things would
take longer ... but now we're really confident we can get the entire
system up quickly." Marketing organizations including the Direct
Marketing Association fought the registry in court and in Congress, but
ultimately the registry was allowed to proceed. Consumers will be able
to add their names to the registry, and, beginning in September,
marketers will not be allowed to call anyone whose name appears on the list.
Those who violate the statute face fines of up to $11,000 per violation.

STUDY SHOWS RISKS TO BROADBAND USE
A new study from the National Cyber Security Alliance indicates a gap
between broadband users' perceptions of how secure their systems are
and the real level of security. According to the study of 120 broadband
users, 77 and 86 percent consider their systems safe from hackers and
online threats, respectively. More than 40 percent, however, do not
have a firewall. A majority of the users in the study have antivirus
software installed on their systems, but most do not regularly update
that software, leaving them vulnerable to new viruses. Keith Nahigian,
spokesman for the alliance and a consultant to the Office of Homeland
Security, noted that broadband users are at significantly higher risk
for security problems than dial-up users because of the speed of
broadband connections and the fact that they typically are always on.

ROYALTY DEAL REACHED FOR NON-COMMERCIAL WEBCASTERS
The recording industry and non-commercial Webcasters have reached an
agreement on royalty rates that will avoid a potentially lengthy and
expensive arbitration process and will allow most stations to continue
Webcasts. Non-commercial stations, including many college radio
stations, had been involved in a lengthy dispute over the royalty rates
set by the Librarian of Congress, rates the stations said were too high
for non-commercial operations. Under the deal, non-commercial
Webcasters can choose to pay 0.0762 cents per song per listener or
0.0117 cents per listener hour. The deal is retroactive to 1998, the
year in which Congress mandated that Webcasters must pay royalties to
artists and music labels.

[How Much Fast Would The Internet Run Without Spam???]

NO CONSOLATION IN NEW DATA ON SPAM
A recent survey by Symantec finds that significant percentages of
children are exposed to spam regularly, often outside the scope of
parental supervision. According to the survey, 47 percent of kids
between the ages of 7 and 18 have received pornographic spam, and 21
percent read spam. Nearly a third said they do not know if spam is good
or bad, and 22 percent said their parents have not talked to them about
spam. Forty-six percent said they give their e-mail addresses to
friends or to Web sites without parental permission. Separately, the
Radicati Group released new estimates for the monetary costs of spam.
According to the group, if nothing is done to curb the spread of spam,
by 2007 there will be more than 33 billion corporate spam e-mails per
day, costing businesses nearly $200 billion annually. The group
projects that spam could account for 49 percent of all corporate e-mail
traffic by 2007, compared to 24 percent in 2003.
