============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

2) News

May 2003 Broadcast of Gutenberg Radio.

Featured :

The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne.
[The conclusion of Nemo's tale, Captain of the submarine Nautilus.]

Stereo : The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

Mono : The Legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles.

For Download :
[all downloads are in stereo, .mp3, zipped, one file per chapter.]

Franz Kafka Metamorphosis.
Jules Verne 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
Jules Verne The Mysterious Island.
H. G. Wells The Time Machine.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Bram Stoker Dracula.

All Gutenberg Radio broadcasts become part of the official Gutenberg
archives after review, possible editing and approval.  This usually
takes 6 to 8 weeks. And books are frequently reissued to leverage advances in
audio technology.

So don't despair if you miss a broadcast!  Soon it will be available at
http://www.promo.net/pg/ for download.  You are free to start a broadcast of
your own, as long as you abide by the Gutenberg copyrights
and procedures.  Basically, broadcast but DON'T SELL.

If you want to mark up a book for broadcast, watch these announcements.
We will be publishing a manual to help you do so in these pages. At the moment,
we would like novels and short stories in English more than anything
else. But Spanish is in our immediate future, as are biographies and histories,
though these will be introduced somewhat later.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not updated instantly, as additional research may need to be done by our professional Chief Cataloguer, so for those who wish to obtain these new ebooks, please refer to the following section.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS: A PAGE A DAY OR MORE IS ALL IT TAKES

If you haven't already, please visit the Project
Gutenberg Distributed Proofreading (DP) project:

	http://texts01.archive.org/dp

By spending a few minutes per page, you can help
Project Gutenberg to reach our goal of 10,000 eBooks
by the end of 2003.  Proofreading is easy and fun,
and there are easy books for newcomers to select from.

Distributed Proofreading is seeking post-processing
people, too.  After you have completed a number of
pages, you can start doing final assembly on eBooks.
There are hundreds of eBooks ready for post-processing,
and you could help to get them added to the Project
Gutenberg collection!

Got books suitable for destructive scanning (where the
binding is chopped off so the pages may be fed to an
automatic scanner)?  Check whether they're already in
the collection, and if not send them to our scanner
site:

	Charles Franks
	9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
	Las Vegas, NV 89117

To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  The
In Progress list includes eBooks that are not yet completed:
http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

For more information about Distributed Proofreading,
