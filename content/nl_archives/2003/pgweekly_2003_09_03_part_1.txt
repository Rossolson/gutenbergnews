*** Requests For Assistance

!!!

I need a copy of zip for AIX that can do the "-9" high compression,
and still unzip via the standard unzip programs!!!

***

I am working on trying to collect and convert some public domain folk tunes
to ABC notation.  Could use some help tracking down public domain versions
of the melodies or proof that these songs are in the public domain.  Songs
I'm working on at present include:
I Know Where I'm Going
Simple Gifts
She Moved Throught The Fair
A Sailor Courted a Farmer's Daughter (aka Constant Lovers)
The Fisher Who Died in His Bed
Ufros Alienu
If anyone's interesting in converting folk songs to a digital public
domain format and would like to help or if you want to contact me, you can
do so through the mailing list at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pdsongs

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me,
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test DVD here right now!!!  Nearly all
of our first 9,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

We are seeking pro bono or very cheap legal assistance to pursue
Project Gutenberg trademark infringers and similar issues.  Please
email Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com>.

[We received 3 replies from the US, 1 from Australia, but
may need more around December 10.]

The Future Of Project Gutenberg

We have had renewed interest in various areas of music, from publishing
more song lyrics and scores to listenable pieces in MIDI, WAV, and MP3.
We would LOVE to expand our Music Team to all kinds of music:  classical,
folk, jazz, and music from a wide variety of countries and cultures.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help a lot, by simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 35 weeks of this year, we have produced 2584 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 2584 eBooks!!!

         That's 35 WEEKS as Compared to ~30 YEARS!!!


With 9,327 eBooks online as of September 3, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.07 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.70 when we had 5870 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 9,327 books each costing $.63 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 9,327 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 9327 eBooks in 32 Years and 3.00 Months We Averaged
    289 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     24 Per Month
    .80 Per Day

At 2584 eBooks Done In The 245 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     10.5 Per Day
     73.5 Per Week
    321.5 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production, each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


From Newsscan:

CALLING ALL SPAMMERS
Who would ever have thought? It turns out that spammers need online
community, too, and they can find it at The Bulk Club -- a support group
for junk e-mailers. The overnight success of The Bulk Club (159 members
signed up since its launch six months ago) belies the stereotype of the
spammer as lone sociopath, lurking in the Internet's shadows. In fact, the
club's rapidly swelling membership signals a move on the part of spammers
to circle the wagons in an effort to protect and legitimize the embattled
bulk e-mail industry. And what do members get for their $20 per month fee?
Access to a variety of how-to articles (such as "How to Spoof"), spamming
software, a members' message board and "300,000 FRESH e-mails/week." Also,
thanks to a Web site security flaw uncovered last week, they received a bit
of unwanted publicity -- the entire Bulk Club membership roster was
revealed, including some of the biggest names in bulk e-mailing: Damon
Decrescenzo, a Florida junk e-mail who's been sued by both Microsoft and
Amazon; Internet porn king Seth Warshavsky; and John Milton -- an alias used
by former neo-Nazi Davis Wolfgang Hawke -- and Jon Thau, both of whom are
responsible for many of those penis enlargement ads you might have received.
(Wired.com 2 Sep 2003)
http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,60224,00.html

AMAZON SUES SPAMMERS
Amazon.com has filed federal lawsuits against 11 e-mail marketers it
accuses of faking their e-mail addresses to appear as though the messages
were sent by Amazon (a practice that is known as "spoofing" and is linked
with spam abuses). The research firm IDC predicts that half of all external
corporate e-mail -- more than 2 trillion messages this year -- will be
spam. (USA Today 26 Aug 2003)
www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/2003-08-26-amazon-sues-spammers_x.htm

EARTHLINK SUES SPAMMERS
EarthLink, the third largest U.S. Internet service provider, has sued 100
spammers located mostly in Alabama and Canada, alleging they used stolen
credit cards, identity theft and banking fraud to pay for Internet accounts
used to send out more than 250 million junk e-mails. The spammers eluded
detection for about six months by creating bogus accounts and leasing phone
lines that would automatically connect to EarthLink, even if the bogus
users were kicked off. "Our investigation has been ongoing for a number of
months, and this is a very tech-savvy spam ring which has made this a
particularly challenging investigation," says Karen Cashion, lead counsel
for EarthLink's lawsuit. The spam messages included ads for herbal
impotence treatments, mortgage loans and fake company Web sites used for
"phishing" personal and financial information from unsuspecting victims.
EarthLink says it is still working to identify each spammer (the lawsuit
lists the Alabama culprits as John Does 1-25), but plans to contact law
enforcement officials once it can finger individuals. (AP 27 Aug 2003)

[At Least The Broadcast Media ID'd Him As An 18 Year Old Boy]

TEENAGER IDENTIFIED AS 'BLASTER' VANDAL
An 18-year-old man has been identified as one author of the Blaster and
LovSan computer worms that have slowed corporate networks throughout the
world. The FBI says he will be arrested today. Another individual
apparently alerted authorities after seeing the man testing the code. All
the Blaster virus variants took advantage of a flaw in that part of Windows
software that's used to share data files across computer networks. Infected
computers were programmed to automatically launch an attack on a Web site
operated by Microsoft, windowsupdate.com, where Microsoft customers will
find software patches to ward off attacks by computer vandals.

WEBCASTERS SUE RIAA
Webcaster Alliance, an organization of 400 music broadcasters, has filed a
federal lawsuit charging that the major music labels and the Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA) are monopolists who violated federal
antitrust laws when they went about setting music royalty rates for the
Internet. The webcasters seek an injunction to prevent the major labels
from enforcing their intellectual property rights and collecting royalty
payments. The RIAA calls the suit a publicity stunt without merit." (AP/USA

OPERA, MOZILLA DEBUT NEW BROWSER BETAS
Two of the remaining rivals to Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser
each released new beta versions, touting improved speed and performance.
The Mozilla beta, based on an open-source version of the Netscape browser,
offers better Internet Relay Chat and XML support, a spell-checker for
e-mail, faster loading and improved standards support. Opera's beta version
features faster loading, improvements in the version designed for handheld
browsing, and support for Arabic and Hebrew. According to OneStat.com, more
than 95% of today's Web surfers use Microsoft IE, compared with about 1.6%
that choose Mozilla and just 0.6% choosing Opera. (CNet News.com 28 Aug 2003)

[Of Course Linus Torvalds Just Recommends Not Keeping Data So Private]
["Only wimps use backup:  _real_ men just upload their important stuff
on FTP, and let the rest of the world mirror it ;)" -- Linus Torvalds]

BATTLING THE THREAT OF DATA EXTINCTION
Because most digital files are dependent on the operating systems in which
they're stored and the software applications used to create and access
them, would-be archivists are faced with the task of retaining and
maintaining the digital hardware necessary to read digital files as well as
the files themselves. "With each passing day, the reservoir of digital
documents grows," says Eastman Kodak manager Andrew Lawrence. "Often, there
is no associated hard-copy output to archive via conventional means. Over
time, the problem is that media decays and hardware and software platforms
evolve, placing the electronically stored information at risk." Lawrence
suggests the best approach to digital preservation is a dual track. For
short-term needs, users can maintain structured electronic archives in
their native formats. But for longer-term purposes, Lawrence suggests
creating a referenced archive of permanent document images in analog
format, such as microfilm, that could provide a technology-proof
repository. Glenn Widener, director of Internet technology at Swiftview,
has a different solution. He recommends using the Printer Control Language
(PCL) format, invented by Hewlett-Packard for its LaserJet family of
printers, as an easy way to preserve documents. "Many PCL viewers can view
15 to 20 years back. There will always be commercial tools readily
available to read it." Meanwhile, Dan Schonfeld, director of products for
Artesia, says his company's digital asset management software enables users
to archive viewers, readers and players along with files. "Because we can

TEEN ARRESTED FOR BLASTER VIRUS
Federal authorities have arrested an 18-year-old Minnesota boy for his
part in the recent "Blaster" virus attack. Jeffrey Lee Parson admitted
that he modified parts of the Blaster virus and distributed it under
several other names, including "Blaster.B." Computers infected with
Parson's version of the virus registered themselves on a Web site
Parson operated, and Parson told the FBI that his variant of the virus
allowed him to reconnect with infected computers later. Parson's
version of the virus reportedly infected at least 7,000 computers,
causing damages far in excess of the $5,000 threshold for most hacker
cases. Worldwide, an estimated 500,000 computers were infected by all
versions of the Blaster virus, making it one of the worst attacks all year.

RIAA REVEALS TRACKING METHODS
Included in court documents filed by the Recording Industry Association
of America (RIAA) are details about some of the group's tactics and
methods for determining which file swappers are trading copyrighted
files. The group has subpoenaed the ISP of a woman suspected of trading
copyrighted works, to obtain her identity. The woman, who remains
unidentified, is challenging the RIAA's subpoena. Her attorney has
said that all the files on her computer were copies of legally
purchased songs. In its filings, however, the RIAA indicates that
so-called "hashes," or digital fingerprints, indicate that at least
some of the files on the woman's computer came from Napster as long
ago as May 2000. The RIAA flatly stated that the woman's recordings
were not from her own CDs and that she is "not an innocent or
accidental infringer." The RIAA's court filings also reveal that the
group examines metadata tags, which are buried inside many MP3 files,
as a tool for determining the source of the files.

[Interesting This Never Happened Until Copyrights Were Extended]

FRESHMAN ORIENTATION COVERS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Across the country as students show up on college campuses, an
increasingly common component of orientation is a lesson on copyrights,
possible infringements using technology, and the potential
repercussions. The Recording Industry Association of America is
continuing to serve ISPs--including many colleges--with subpoenas to
identify suspected copyright violators, and the group has said it will
begin filing lawsuits against the most egregious abusers. Educating
students about the realities of intellectual property is the approach
many university officials have taken to limit their institutions'
potential liability, as well as to control bandwidth-usage problems
created by file trading. Some students remain unconvinced, however.
Samuel Hicks, who is entering American University this fall, was not
persuaded by the presentation he attended. "This isn't going to stop
me from downloading anything," he said. "[The recording industry would]
have to do a lot of work to catch me."
