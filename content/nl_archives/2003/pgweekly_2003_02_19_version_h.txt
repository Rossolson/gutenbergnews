Requests for Assistance:

Project Gutenberg has received a generous donation of over 20 Pentium
Pro 100 computers.  If you have a need for a computer to do Project
Gutenberg work or can make good use of computers (setting up a
"Project Gutenberg" section at a local library or school) please
let William Fishburne (william.fishburne@verizon.net) know!
The computers are physically in Northern Virginia and if you are not,
it would be necessary for you to arrange for the shipping cost.
Please send in your thoughts and ideas on how PG can make best use
of this dated windfall!  There are no boxes for most of these, so it
would be MUCH easier to organize a sort of "bucket-brigade" of people
who COULD get to the DC area [20 miles down towards Manassas] and get
some of these a day or two closer to others who may be able to make a
trip part way to get them, etc., etc., etc.  These are GREAT for any
wordprocessing, etc. . .it's just about exactly what I am using here,
for all my Project Gutenberg work.  However, these are NOT good for
the "bloatware" operating systems and programs if you are going to
reload and reboot a lot. . .takes some real time for this.  However,
I scanned the first books I ever OCRed on something much slower. . . .


***

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

Statistical Review

(This number includes the etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)


In the first 7 weeks of the new year, we have produced 422 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production.

With 7165 eTexts online as of February 19, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.40 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.16 when we had 4620 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7165 books each costing $0.77 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7165 books each costing 35% less a year later???


At 7165 eBooks in 31 Years We Averaged 19.26 eBooks per month

At 422 eBooks Done in 2003 We Averaged 135.00 eBooks per month

Headlines From Newsscan:

FILM, MUSIC GROUPS TARGET WORKPLACE PIRATES
The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture
Association of America have published a guide for employers, asking major
corporations to curb illicit file-swapping by workers on company time. The
guide, titled "A Corporate Policy Guide to Copyright Use and Security on
the Internet," requests that businesses advise employees against copyright
abuse using corporate computer systems and warns that such abuse is
illegal, damages corporate reputations, increases corporate network
security risks, and can put organizations at risk of legal liability. The
guide cites a case in which an Arizona company paid a $1 million settlement
in April 2002 to the RIAA after workers were found to be accessing and
distributing thousands of music files via the company server. (Reuters 13

EUROPEAN COMMISSION PLANS CYBERSECURITY AGENCY
The European Commission proposed creating the European Network and
Information Security Agency to provide advice for the 15 EU members on
cybersecurity issues. The agency is scheduled to begin operating in
January 2004, at a site to be chosen by the governments of the 15
member states. The commission has set aside $26 million to fund the
agency over the next five years, with additional funds planned to
support the 10 new member states expected to join in 2004. The agency
will assist EU members' own cybercrime authorities, specifically
computer emergency response teams. The increased coordination among
member states is expected to benefit the EU as a whole in achieving a
high level of security for Internet use.

ADVISORY GROUPS TO OVERSEE TIA PROGRAM
The Pentagon formed an internal and an external committee to address
privacy concerns arising from the Total Information Awareness (TIA)
program in a move to prevent Congress from monitoring the program too
closely. Headed by John Poindexter, TIA aims to identify terrorists by
monitoring Internet usage and commercial and financial databases in the
U.S. and abroad. A Senate amendment last month banned deployment of the
program and curbed research for it. The Pentagon formed the advisory
panels to minimize the scope of the provision, now before a
House-Senate conference committee, by convincing Congress that the
committees will adequately address balancing security and privacy
concerns. Senator Ron Wyden, who sponsored the provision, noted that
the panels .did not get an election certificate. and that .Congress on
a bipartisan basis is going to continue to demand accountability,
oversight, and legally established safeguards..
