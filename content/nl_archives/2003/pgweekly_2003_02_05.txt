DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!


Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


We will also have this
new address in Chicago!


Charles Aldarondo
701 Riverside Drive
Park Ridge, IL 60068


Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. <mr_der@hotmail.com> is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

From: Miranda van de Heijning <m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com>
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the 5 weeks of this year, we have produced 287 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1995 to produce our FIRST 287 eBooks!!!

         That's 5 WEEKS as Compared to 24 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 7,055 eBooks online as of January 1, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.42 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.23 when we had 4492 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing $.81 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 7030 eBooks in 31 1/2 Years We Averaged
    223 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     19 Per Month
     .6 Per Day

At 287 eBooks Done In 2003 We Averaged
      8 Per Day
     57 Per Week
    287 Per Month

[From Project Gutenberg's Very Own Janis Ian, Recording Superstar]

"Janis Ian ... has written this editorial in the Los Angeles Times.
Janis says, "After I first posted downloadable music, my merchandise
sales went up 300%. They're still double what they were before the MP3s
went online." And the RIAA's stated goal in preventing this type of
activity with their lawsuit against Verizon is to increase sales..."

INTERNET WORM TOOK ONLY 10 MINUTES TO CAUSE GLOBAL HAVOC
The "SQL Slammer" worm that slowed Internet traffic significantly last week
managed to infect computer servers worldwide in about 10 minutes, making it
the fastest such virus seen, according to a University of California at San
Diego team. "At its peak, achieved approximately three minutes after it was
released, the worm scanned 55 million Internet hosts per second. It infect
ed at least 750,000 victims, and probably considerably more," says one team
member. The SQL Slammer worm was only the third of its type seen on the
Net, and managed to spread nearly 100 times faster than the Code Red
infection 18 months ago. (The Independent 4 Feb 2003)

NEW $2.1B DEBT MAY LOWER AOL TIME WARNER'S CREDIT RATING
Standard & Poor analyst Heather M. Goodchild says that AOL Time Warner's
announcement of plans to add $2.1 billion to restructure finances of its
cable operations may result in a lower credit rating for the company:
"Deferral of a cable IPO, loss of momentum with other de-leveraging or a
weakening of the operating outlook could lead to a downgrade."

AOL TIME WARNER: "CAN ANYONE HERE RUN THIS COMPANY?
With AOL Time Warner humiliated by two years of failure (declining
revenues, subscribers and advertisers), one close observer remarks: "It's
sort of like Casey Stengel in his first year at the Mets. If you remember,
they were a bunch of boobs and Casey asked, 'Can anyone here play this
game?' With AOL, it's 'Can anyone run this company?'" Just about everyone
agrees that AOL Time Warner needs a new corporate vision -- and quick! Will
the company's chief executive and (soon-to-be) chairman Richard D. Parsons
be up to the task. Everyone hopes so, but one institutional investor who
sold his stock pointed out all the company's current problems "happened
under his watch." Parsons said the company is on track for meeting its
goals, which include substantial reduction of a $27 billion debt --
possibly by selling such assets as AOL itself, its half interests in the
Comedy Central and Court TV cable networks, or its money-losing Atlanta
sports teams, the Braves, Hawks, and Thrashers. (New York Times 2 Feb 2003)

CHESS MOVES: HAVE COMPUTERS DUMBED-DOWN THE ANCIENT GAME?
The current closely-contested match between world chess champion Garry
Kasparov and a computer has been the occasion for some chess fans to
complain that computers are ruining the game. Chess master Evgeni Bareev
says, "We don't work at chess anymore. We just look at the stupid computer,
we follow the latest games and find small improvements. We have lost
depth." In agreement with Bareev are Maurice Ashley, a grandmaster from New
York, and Hans Berliner, a former world correspondence chess champion.
Ashley: "People don't experiment as much anymore. That's a loss." Berliner:
"What's happening with chess is it's gradually losing its place as the par
excellence intellectual activity. Chess is winding down." But Frederic
Freidel, the founder of the leading chess software company, strenuously
disagrees, and says that chess-play is now better than ever: "The
combination of man and computer is much more powerful than either on its
own." Freidel has been promoting "advance chess," in which human players
openly use computer software as they compete against each other in games.

AO-HELL
Will the bad news from AOL Time Warner ever stop? Hard on the heels of huge
new losses ($98.2 billion) and continuing high-level executive defections
(Ted Turner being the latest), the company now has the embarrassment of
revealing that in the last three months of 2002 the number of subscribers
to its America Online component dropped by 170,000. That's the first time
AOL's subscription numbers have ever fallen, and the fall has come despite
a recent $1 billion advertising and promotion campaign and on top of a
plunge in the company's advertising revenue. CNBC has referred to the
situation as AO-Hell, and the J.P. Morgan Chase investment firm warned its
clients that "the modest decline in AOL's subscription base will spark
renewed fears over AOL's long-term viability." But it concluded its
investment advisory on a more positive note: "We continue to believe that
the AOL business is fixable and that the core Time Warner businesses remain
valuable." (Washington Post 31 Jan 2003)

VERIZON GOES TO COURT TO DEFEND CUSTOMER PRIVACY
Verizon Communications is asking a federal appeals court to declare
unconstitutional a lower-court decision that ordered it to reveal the
identity of a customer suspected of downloading copyrighted music files
over the Internet. Verizon deputy general counsel John Thorne says, "I see
a great jeopardy of privacy for people who are not doing anything wrong,"
and notes the lower court's ruling would make it possible for "strangers,
stalkers, telemarketers, pollsters, creditor and anybody else" to obtain
the identity of almost any Internet user. "No matter where you go, your
identity can be compelled to be revealed under this process." (Reuters/USA

WHAT'S GOING ON? AOL TIME WARNER LOSES $98.7B & ANOTHER BIG-WIG
Ever since the much-ballyhooed merger two years ago of "new media" America
Online with "old media" publishing, music, and movie empire Time Warner,
there's been nothing but corporate recriminations, infighting, and anguish
there. The two men who created the merger, Gerald Levin and Steve Case,
have already departed, as has Bob Pittman. And now vice-chairman Ted Turner
has resigned, following announcement that the company's taking a $98.7
billion loss for 2002, the worst annual loss ever. Turner says he will
devote more time to personal interests and to several "socially responsible
business efforts." (Atlanta Journal-Constitution 30 Jan 2003)

MICROSOFT AGREES TO CHANGE PASSPORT FOR EU
Responding to concerns from the European Union (EU) over its .NET
Passport authentication system, Microsoft this week agreed to various
changes including "a radical change of the information flow." EU
members had expressed concern that Microsoft's system, which is
designed to share authentication information with affiliated sites so
users are not required to re-enter names and passwords, did not
adequately protect personal information, such as addresses, ages, phone
numbers, and credit card numbers. The changes agreed to will allow
users to see information that would be shared among systems and to
decide which of those pieces of personal data they will allow to be
shared. A spokesman for Microsoft said the company welcomes the changes
and that the process of deciding on the changes was an example of
"necessary collaboration between government and industry in order to
achieve a common goal."

[What Was That We Were Saying About Everything Becoming Pay-Per-Whatever?]
PAYING FOR RADIO?
Two start-up companies, Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio
Holdings, are heavily promoting radio-for-pay in private homes and
cars. XM Satellite launched a $100-million national campaign in August
of 2001 to sell the service to the public. Its partners, General
Motors, which offers cars with satellite receivers, and Delphi
Corporation, which sells a $200 portable car boombox, have also
promoted the service. Sirius lags far behind its rival in spending and
subscribers. With 30,000 members compared to XM Satellite's 360,000,
Sirius has hired a prestigious Miami-based advertising firm to launch a
late-night talk show TV campaign to build its customer base. In
addition to more than 100 music channels, Sirius offers news, sports,
religious, and comedy channels for $12.95 a month. Capitalizing on the
notion of music as "social currency," the ads promote Sirius as
anti-establishment by offering subscribers commercial-free, alternative
music. Still far from the two million subscribers needed to break even,
XM Satellite hopes the Sirius campaign will boost its membership as
well by raising consumer awareness.
