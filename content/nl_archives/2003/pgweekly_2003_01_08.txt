**The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, January 8, 2003**
******eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Over 31 Years******

***

This is rather an *emergency* edition of the newsletter, as a LOT of email
has been lost, and many functions of my mainframe are not back online so I
am VERY limited in what and how I can do things right now.

I am just *guessing* that we did 41 eBooks this week, but I only have some
27 listings right now to include in the Newsletter.

There may actually BE 41 eBooks from this week, but I cannot NAME them all
. . .much less provide unique filenames. . .some were duplicated, because
our file counter died along with everything else in the crash. . . .

My apologies, major crash, slow recovery, I may send out a replacement
Newsletter in another day or two with more/all the details. . . .

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the 1 week of this year, we have produced 27 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our *FIRST* 27 eBooks!!!

         That's 1 WEEK as Compared to 21 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 6,742 eBooks online as of January 1, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.48 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.31 when we had 4335 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.83 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 6770 eBooks in 31 1/2 Years We Averaged
    214 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     18 Per Month
     .6 Per Day

At 27 eBooks Done In 2003 We Averaged
    3 eBooks Per Day
   27 eBooks Per Week
  204 eBooks Per Month [Last Year]

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

EU COPYRIGHT LAWS SPAWN 'FREE-SWAPPING ZONE' FOR OLDIES
European and Canadian copyright protections for audio recordings last just
50 years, compared with 95 years in the U.S., a disparity that has spawned
a boomlet in legitimate sales of golden oldies from 1950s artists, ranging
from Miles Davis to Elvis Presley. The expiration of music copyrights
overseas just adds one more piece to an antipiracy puzzle that is growing
increasingly complex. "There are some implications for enforcement,
creating an additional wrinkle," says Neil Turkewitz, executive VP for
international affairs at the Recording Industry Association of America.
"But it doesn't affect the legality of a U.S. user accessing a foreign hard
drive and downloading a file." Record industry officials say they are
keeping an eye out for the emergence of Web sites that offer archives of
material that is in the public domain in a foreign country but still
illegal to trade freely in the U.S. If a Web-based service comes online, it
may be possible to block access to the site from the U.S. by going through
ISPs, says Turkewitz. Trying to shut down peer-to-peer services would be
more difficult, however, he acknowledges. That's part of the reason that
the RIAA has been pressuring European policy-makers to extend their
copyright protections to match those of the U.S., but so far those efforts
have met with little success. (CNet News.com 7 Jan 2003)

[Time To Start Your Own Software Company?]

ONLINE POLLS REFLECT CONSERVATIVE OUTLOOK
While both Democrats and Republicans were likely to turn to the Internet as
a source of news and political information during last fall's midterm
elections, Republicans were much more likely to register their views in
online polls, according to a study by the Pew Internet and American Life
project. Nearly half of the Republicans who went online in search of
election news said they liked to participate in online polls, compared with
23% of Democrats. The bottom line is that Web sites operating online polls
should take those results with a grain of salt, says Lee Rainie, director
of the Pew project. "They very much skew toward more conservative views.
People who rely on Internet polls are relying on a false indicator."

'DVD JON' ACQUITTED BY NORWEGIAN COURT
Jon Lech Johansen (also known as DVD Jon), who was accused of illegally
developing and distributing the DeCSS program for breaking the digital
copy-protection mechanism on DVDs, has been acquitted in a Norwegian court.
The rationale for the judge's decision was that the software could be used
for legal purposes as well as illegal ones. "If a person's motive is to
solely encourage or solicit illegal actions, then it would be illegal to
distribute it" -- but the court made the judgment that Johansen was not
motivated in that way. (PC World 7 Jan 2003)
http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,108462,00.asp

SUPREME COURT BACKS OFF ON DVD DESCRAMBLING CODE
The U.S. Supreme Court has rescinded an emergency stay barring defendant
Matthew Pavlovich from distributing DeCSS, a software utility that
descrambles the digital lock on most DVDs to prevent copying them.
Pavlovich is now free to distribute the code, but could be sued again if he
[odd comment]
decides to do so. "The entertainment companies need to stop pretending that
DeCSS is a secret," says Cindy Cohn, legal director for the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, which is assisting Pavlovich. "Justice O'Connor
correctly saw that there was no need for emergency relief to keep DeCSS a
secret. It doesn't pass the giggle test." The rescission is just the latest
twist in a case that has been winding its way through the courts since
1999, when the DVD Copy Control Association -- a coalition of movie studios
and consumer electronics makers -- filed a lawsuit against scores of people,
alleging violations of California's trade secret laws.

PUBLISHERS EXPUNGE ARTICLES, UPSET RESEARCHERS
Elsevier Science, the largest publisher of scientific journals, has
begun removing certain articles from its database. In place of the
articles, an online search now offers a note that simply says the
article has been removed "for legal reasons." Other publishers have
taken steps to expunge particular articles, for reasons ranging from an
article's having been published previously elsewhere to inclusion of
political statements that the publishers deemed "inappropriate" for
publication in a particular journal. Many researchers object to the
practice, however, saying that altering the historical record of a
journal distorts efforts at scholarship and, in certain cases, can lead
to faulty research or even poor medical decisions. Mark S. Frankel of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science said, "There
should be a digital trail which allows these things to be seen,
observed, and studied."

JUDGE IMPOSES INJUNCTION AGAINST DOMAIN REGISTRY
Internet domain registrar Register.com has won an injunction against
the Domain Registry of America (DROA) from a federal judge.
Register.com has accused DROA of violating trademarks and of misleading
domain holders to trick them into changing registrars for their
domains. The judge in the case compared the practice to "slamming," a
ploy used by some phone companies to trick customers into thinking
their phone service had been changed to a new company. A court action
this summer prevented VeriSign from sending similarly misleading
messages to domain holders. Register.com said it will seek significant
monetary damages in the case. A trial date has not been set.

SWITCHING CARRIERS GETS EASIER
As of November 24, 2003, switching wireless carriers will be much
simpler than it is now. A regulation requiring phone number portability
will go into effect, allowing users to change carriers without changing
numbers. The wireless industry had fought against the rule, earning a
one-year extension of the deadline, but ultimately lost to pressure
from consumers and regulators. The process of switching Internet
service providers (ISPs) is being simplified as well, due in part to
efforts from ISPs and from companies such as Esaya, which has developed
a tool that streamlines migrating to a new ISP. Research shows that a
majority of users see the difficulty of switching e-mail addresses,
calendars, and the like as an obstacle to changing ISPs. According to a
representative of Esaya, however, the market is largely saturated, and
most of any ISP's current customers have transferred from another provider.
