1) Editorial

Hello,

In a hard week for PG, where the petty cash looks petty and the
computers keep going on the blink, sometimes it's hard to keep your
enthusiasm up and the motivation goes out of the window. Well, get
enthused and motivated folks, PG needs you to keep doing what you are
doing and not give up now! If you have any comments following
Michael's message from earlier this week please feel free to send
them. Here at the newsletter we would like to hear your views.

Also, today the newsletter brings you not one, but two new
correspondents, and if you are a reader of DP forums you are in for a
real treat! Talking of DP, just got room to sneak in a quick WELL
DONE! to Prishan, I'm sure you'll find more information below.

Happy reading,

Alice

(news@pglaf.org - If you hit reply, the mail you
send does not reach me and disappears into the ether, it's an
anti-spam policy.)

We welcome feedback and awkward questions at the address above. Please
feel free to send our general ramblings to a friend.

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

2) News

Distributed Proofreaders Update

August is traditionally a time of the year when the 'Net quiets down
somewhat and people enjoy off-line activities. Nobody seems to have
told this to the folks over at Distributed Proofreaders. In fact,
things seem to be gaining more momentum this month around
DP. Attendance is steady, yet the number of pages proofed continues to
follow the upward trend of previous months. It already looks like the
August goal of 128,000+ will be well met and surpassed.

Behind the scenes, the tireless DP developers are finishing the next
major upgrade to the site. Joseph Gruber has been working on (among a
dozen other things) a new statistics page for proofers which provides
a variety of information to measure accomplishments. More about this
in upcoming issues.

Another buzz this week is about the Project Release Queue. These are book 
projects which are in line with tickets, waiting to begin the proofreading 
process. At this stage each book or text has been fully prepared for
proofreaders. There are presently over 1250 projects in the Q'. To
underscore the significance of this figure, two months ago there were
less than 250 projects prepared and waiting. All we need are 
willing proofreaders to sail well beyond the 10K marker. The books are there, 
ready and waiting

Finally, it would be an injustice to close out the week's review without 
acknowledging the milestone of DP's ace proofer Prishan, who completed
his 50,000th page this week.
That's quite a stack of books!

Next week we'll take a closer peek into the Release Queue and get a glimpse 
at the future shelves of Project Gutenberg.

Radio Gutenberg Update

http://www.radio-gutenberg.com

This week RG is running AEsop's Fables on channel 1 and The Lion, the
Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis on channel 2.

Many thanks are due to Robert Sheckley who has kindly donated
non-exclusive rights to a live reading of his story 'Bad Medicine'.

If you are interested in creating a slide-show with a soundtrack
from your favourite book, or piece of literature please mail us here
at news@pglaf.org and we will pass your message on.

a different format to make your life a little easier. An example of
the changed listing is given below. If you would like either a daily
or weekly version of this list please email news@pglaf.org, and state

3) Notes and Queries

Notes about home economics archive e-text collection. 

At the beginning it was an email from Anne reminding Project Gutenberg
volunteers about an e-text collection available on the internet and
waiting for its proofreaders. The site is called Home Economics
Archive. It contains, according to the info on their home page, 605
books and 106 journal volumes connected to the degree studies in
housewifing, from the first third of 19th century. There are a lot of
praises and curses said about the Home Economics themselves, besides
my own deeply philosophical thoughts around the subject (but since all
this is not connected to the e-texts, I'll leave it to oneside).   

Foremost, this an awesome collection of the articles on wide variety
of themes which reminded me of the cracked sea-chest packed with
dusted fashion-journals 150 years old from the loft in a grandparents'
house. Take for example, The art of rearing silk-worms? composed in
the year 1825 A.D. by Vincenzo Dandolo, in London. It definitely has
an aroma of the fairy-tale, where people in the foggy (in contrast to
nowadays) British capital used to grow up long cylindrical
caterpillars in their living rooms. Of course, besides the oddness of
the subject, it provides an interesting insight into natural sciences
before the theory of evolution. 
Second, while not everybody, I guess, will share my excitement about
that kind of curiosity, then perhaps, an article by S. Freud dated
1920, may awake interest of most serious readers.

Finally the third aspect, as Anne mentioned in her email, can be
purely utilitarian to apply the actual knowledge of those people who
could (at least in theory) sew an evening dress or make wonderful jams
from strawberries grown in the backyard of their self-made
summer-houses. It certainly may serve this purpose, however, rather
than people in third world countries (who do not have usually an
access to the internet or even knowledge about computers, while they
do have a lot of personal experience about making jams and sewing
clothes), it may serve curious habitants of the lands covered with
supermarkets and shopping malls. Why not to try to build the cottage
using the designs of more than century ago or to cook according to
some old recipe. [Some of us do indeed do this - Ed]

So with all above in the mind, can one classify this type of e-texts
as suitable for PG or not? The PG search directions clearly state that
'Our Collection of E-texts is mainly about Literature, so don't be
surprised if it will be hard to find books on other subjects', there
are some, but they are a minority. Is it going to stay like this or is
it going to change? The contras of the expansion are quite clear:
impossibility to seize the immense and the limited amount of
proofreader/hours in a day. However, as times go by the boundary
between literature and non-literature becomes more and more blurred,
and who can tell what will be more interesting for the future
generations of e-readers, the fiction novel or the real such as 'Young
Woman's Guide to Excellence' written centuries ago?

The collection is well sorted, has easy and usable search engine and
provides both the images of the original pages and the plain
texts. However the plain texts are not formatted according to PG
standards and have plenty of typographical mistakes (like 'nothing; ;T
was mine, t is his' in Shakespeare quotation), so the reading is a bit painful. 

As the concluding sentence, I want to say that in my still outsider
eyes, this collection is definitely worth having a proud PG mark on
it. May these notes serve a cause, and nice proofreading to all of you!

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Please visit the site:
http://www.pgdp.net for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

 If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

 Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

********

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time or
technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Send email to
dphelp@pgdp.net saying that you are interested in post-processing and we
will help you find a project to work on.
