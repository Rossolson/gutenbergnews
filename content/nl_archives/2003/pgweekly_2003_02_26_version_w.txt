the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:

3) News

As mentioned last issue, Project Gutenberg and Distributed Proofreaders was 
mentioned in Time Out New York last week (issue 387). The feature is not yet 
up on the website. You can however, find a summary of the article on the 
General forum of the DP site, you do need to register to read this (of 
course, you are registered and proof-reading already!). I will be happy to 
run the article in the newsletter if someone can send me a scanned version at 
newsletter@schiffwood.demon.co.uk. If you have a fax, please mail me and we 
will sort something out.

4) Readers letters

Hi Alice,

I'd be interested to read any suggestions from Gutenbergers and others on
a convenient and reasonably-priced item of hand-held equipment for reading
etexts. I haven't got a hand-held computer and have no interest in
getting one as such, but should I look out for a second-hand machine simply
as an etext reader?  I have heard of the REB machines, but they don't seem
to be available in the UK, and anyway, I think there was some sort of
restriction on what could be loaded(?),  --   there was also mention 
recently of a Chinese "ebook v1.0" being produced by Culturecom  --  
does anyone know of progress on that?

Regards,

Les.

{Unfortunately, I cannot add to this debate myself as I use my lap-top, hint 
for birthday prezzie there. However, I do know that a lot of Gutenbergers use 
PDAs, I am sure that this has been a topic on the DP forums, so please send 
in your thoughts. Any contributions to newsletter@schiffwood.demon.co.uk 
please.}

                    -------------------

More hidden gems from DP

1) Stephen Leacock is probably familiar to many, but
for those who have never read him, some of his best
work is in PG. He was a Canadian economics professor
who wrote some of the most entertaining humour of the
early twentieth century in his spare time.
Particularly recommended in PG are Arcadian Adventures
with the Idle Rich, My Discovery of England, Nonsense
Novels and Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town.

More info on him is available at
http://www.leacockmuseum.com/

2) Jerome K. Jerome's classic comic favourite Three
Men in a Boat may be unknown to some; this
late-Victorian tale ranks as one of the most popular
and well-loved comedies of the 19th century, and
remains hilarious today.

See http://www.jeromekjerome.com/ for more info.


3)There are several books of literary criticism in PG.
Browsing through some of these could easily lead to
ideas for specific authors and works to seek by
delving deeper into PG. Andrew Lang has a few for
starters.

Sorry if these seem too obvious! :/

All the best!

Wives and Daughters - A Review

What a gem! That's what I said to myself when I finished reading Elizabeth 
Cleghorn Gaskell's last novel, Wives and Daughters. I consider it a must for 
anyone who enjoys Victorian literature or literature of any period in which 
characters are exquisitely drawn in minute detail and become real people.

Wives and Daughters has characterization in spades! At least a dozen 
characters stand out. Foremost, of course, is the heroine, Molly Gibson - 
intelligent, honest, proper, usually shy but bold when determined - all that 
a Victorian heroine should be. The book opens with Molly not quite grown, 
warmly attached to her widowed father, a diligent and warm-hearted country 
doctor. During a prolonged visit to the nearby home of Squire Hamley, Molly 
becomes attached to and beloved by the Hamley family, including the sons 
Osborne and Roger.

Stubborn, outspoken Squire Hamley has breeding (his family has owned the 
estate since before the Norman conquest) but no education and little money; 
he expects his sons, especially Osborne, the elder, to marry for wealth and 
social position (a theme often explored by Trollope). During Molly's stay at 
Hamley Hall, her father decides she needs a stepmother, and he marries a 
widow with a daughter Molly's age. The second Mrs. Gibson, one of the 
memorable characters in literature, a born schemer and social climber 
unencumbered by veracity, takes charge of Molly and, in trying to make her 
into a "lady," makes her life miserable. 

Mrs. Gibson's daughter Cynthia is all that Molly is not - beautiful, 
fashionable, flirtatious, and irresistibly attractive to young men. But both 
Cynthia and Mr.Osborne Hamley have secrets which are about to blow up. Molly 
unintentionally learns the secrets and does her best to put things right. The 
action takes place in and about a placid country village whose inhabitants 
are wonderfully described, based on the author's personal experience.

Mrs. Gaskell (as she was called by Victorian readers) died before completing 
the last one or two chapters. A modern reader would never know it, but 
Victorians would have missed the final acknowledgment of love and uniting in 
marriage required by their customs. Those who saw the magnificent Exxon-Mobil 
Masterpiece Theatre dramatization on PBS saw one possible ending, but not the 
one planned by Mrs. Gaskell.

Elizabeth Gaskell was unusual in many ways by Victorian standards. She and her 
husband, a Unitarian minister, did not subscribe to the Victorian conviction 
that women should be subordinated to men. Her novels and short stories, while 
portraying Victorian life in accurate detail, explored the relationships of 
men and women, the worth of individuals accorded by character and achievement 
as opposed to social rank, and the plight of workers in the new industrial 
society. One of her novels, Ruth, shocked her contemporaries by dealing with 
illegitimate pregnancy and its consequences in a society with a dual set of 
behavioral standards.

She left fewer than a dozen novels, by the mid-twentieth century largely 
forgotten by all but scholars. She has, in modern parlance, been 
"re-discovered," deservedly, and the quality of her writing has earned her a 
place among the acknowledged greats of Victorian literature. To me, Wives and 
Daughters is far more skillfully written and has a better plot than 
Thackeray's best-known novel, Vanity Fair, and rivals the best of Trollope's 
bountiful output.

Trust me, and try it!

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can

help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

6) Headline News from around the world

COPY PROTECTION EFFORTS MISGUIDED, SAYS LESSIG
Lawmakers will be making a big mistake if they bow to Hollywood pressure 
and enact new copyright-protection legislation based on today's Internet 
use patterns, says Stanford University professor Lawrence Lessig. 
Currently, millions of consumers are downloading music to their PCs because 
slow dialup connections make it impractical to stream content quickly to a 
variety of devices. "In the future, it will be easier to pay for 
subscription services than to be an amateur database administrator who 
moves content from device to device. We're legislating against a background 
of the Internet's current architecture of content distribution, and this is 
a fundamental mistake," Lessig told participants at the Digital Rights 
Management Summit held at Intel headquarters. (AP 20 Feb 2003)

GOOGLE AND THE WORLD OF BLOGGING: YOU ARE WHAT YOU POINT TO
Google's purchase of Pyra, creator of the Blogger software for people who 
want to publish their own Web logs ("blogs") has puzzled some, because the 
businesses seem diametrically opposed: Google is used for finding 
information whereas Blogger is used for producing it. So what's going on? 
Meg Hourihan, one of the founders of Pyra, suggests that the acquisition of 
Blogger will give Google a way of gaining faster access to links in the Web 
logs. "I very much think it's about having the Blogger database, not so 
much the words but what people are pointing to, and getting their finger on 
that in real time." (New York Times 24 Feb 2003)

UNIVERSITY TESTS CONTROVERSIAL MONITORING SOFTWARE
For several months the University of Wyoming has been testing software
from Audible Magic that allows network operators to see exactly what
files are passing through the university's routers. The software goes
beyond bandwidth-shaping applications, which allocate portions of a
network's capacity to certain types of traffic, and recreates files
that use FTP (file transfer protocol) or the Gnutella technology to
identify the content. The next step, theoretically, is to compare files
passing through the network and block transmission of any that are
copyrighted. That prospect has many up in arms about what critics call
censorship, particularly in a university setting. In a letter to
universities last fall, the Electronic Privacy Information Center said,
"Monitoring the content of communications is fundamentally incompatible
with the mission of educational institutions." Brad Thomas, a network
specialist at the University of Wyoming, noted that he doesn't want to
look at what's being sent across the network, and users don't want
their communications monitored. "But," he said, "it's getting to be
the only way to control our bandwidth."

MICROSOFT FILES UNFAIR COMPETITION BRIEF AGAINST SUN
In the latest chapter of the ongoing battle between Microsoft and Sun
Microsystems, Microsoft has filed a court brief accusing Sun of
anti-competitive practices and of violating an earlier agreement
between the two. Sun has tried to convince the courts to prevent
Microsoft from distributing its own version of Java, a technology
originally developed by Sun. In July 2001, Microsoft settled a similar
case with Sun. That settlement, according to Microsoft, gives it the
right to use and distribute its own Java Virtual Machine until 2008.
Sun's current case attacks the method for that distribution--Microsoft
offers Sun's Java as an optional download while its own Java is
included with operating systems. Microsoft argues that Sun's complaint
violates the 2001 settlement and that Sun's continued legal action is
designed "to cause competitive injury to Microsoft."
