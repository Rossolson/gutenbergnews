Hello,

Lots happening here this week. If you are new to Project Gutenberg
through the appearances Michael Hart has made in the media this past
week, then I extend a warm welcome to you. 

Happy reading,

Alice

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

2) News

Radio Gutenberg

http://www.etc-edu.com

May 24, 2003

Third Week in May "Memorial Weekend" broadcast.

On the technical front, we are pleased to announce the first Gutenberg
Audio Book to feature "Dialog Management", a scripting feature that
automatically recognizes dialog passages in a book, and shifts to a
different audio context, just as live readers do when action takes
place. This is the first step in automatically generating unique
character voices for a work, a feat we expect to accomplish this very summer.

Edgar Rice Burroughs' "Tarzan" is the vehicle for our first offering
that uses this exciting new form of TTS automation.

Now that we have introduced a synth voice reader that can beat the
average volunteer reader 9 times out of 10 for consistency, clarity
and plain ole excitement (yep, that was a challenge to anyone one
there that thinks he can do better ...), we wanted to put a live
benchmark out there that highlights the virtues of a good live reading.

For that task, Bugsy makes a new reading of Ring Lardner's "The Real
Dope", a comedy classic of World War I, and a big favorite of American
Doug-boys in France.  Now Bugsy is a real actor, so we don't want to
pit synth against him! His reading illuminates the good will and hope
in the hearts of all the men who went to save France in her hour of need.
His letters to Al are as fresh as the morning dew, bringing his
character to life -- I can smell his cigarette!

So here it is, Tarzan - an adventure classic - done better than you
(or your screen reader) can manage for yourself, courtesy of
"Dr. Kula", and "The Real Dope" the way you wish you could do it.

Enjoy!

"American Antiquities" series:

Memorial Day in the US seemed a good time to start posting this series
of illustrated html files.

The exhaustive title page goes on:  "With a Variety of Reliques,
Antiquities and Modern Autographs(1861)".

There will be fourteen more eBooks of these "American Antiquities"
to follow in the next weeks.   Many of the large images require use
of the "Full Size" button under each image to appreciate detail.
Anyone with a bit of time to explore old American history might
download the following volume  (Plate 46 in this Vol. 7 will
tear your heart out):

http://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05/aa07w10h.zip

For this project we took advantage of Internet Archive's kind offer
of their orbital scanner as many of the images are well beyond the
size of an ordinary flatbed. The 14"x19" books were surface mailed
from New York to California to Geof Pawlicki who scanned the double
page images.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not updated instantly, as additional research may need to be done by our professional Chief Cataloguer, so for those who wish to obtain these new ebooks, please refer to the following section.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS: A PAGE A DAY OR MORE IS ALL IT TAKES

If you haven't already, please visit the Project
Gutenberg Distributed Proofreading (DP) project:

	http://texts01.archive.org/dp

By spending a few minutes per page, you can help
Project Gutenberg to reach our goal of 10,000 eBooks
by the end of 2003.  Proofreading is easy and fun,
and there are easy books for newcomers to select from.

Distributed Proofreading is seeking post-processing
people, too.  After you have completed a number of
pages, you can start doing final assembly on eBooks.
There are hundreds of eBooks ready for post-processing,
and you could help to get them added to the Project
Gutenberg collection!

Got books suitable for destructive scanning (where the
binding is chopped off so the pages may be fed to an
automatic scanner)?  Check whether they're already in
the collection, and if not send them to our scanner
site:

	Charles Franks
	9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
	Las Vegas, NV 89117

To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  The
In Progress list includes eBooks that are not yet completed:
