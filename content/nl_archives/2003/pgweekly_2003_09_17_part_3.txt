New Project Gutenberg Documents
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE, if you are considering adding a new eBook to the Project
Gutenberg collection:

Please make sure that any books you want to work on are _not_ already
in the collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL  (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Also, please be sure
to check David Price's "In Progress" list at:
http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html
to ensure no one is currently working on your selection.  It would also
be helpful if you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books.
More information on this can be found in Parts 1 and/or 2 of the
newsletter.

Note:  this listing best viewed with a fixed-width font, such as Courier New
       or similar.
