***  HOT Requests!!!

For those of you who are trying to get some PR for Project Gutenberg,
the UPI said this week:

"These are momentous times in the digital content industry. . . .

"Project Gutenberg - the pioneering and largest depository of free,
mostly "plain-vanilla" (text only) e-books - added the 10,000-th
title to its unsurpassed collection.  In the meantime, e-book
aggregators, such as blackmask.com, now proffer tens of thousands
of free titles for download in up to 8 file formats. Even Microsoft
has spent the last few months offering a free weekly selection of 3
commercial titles each, exclusively readable on its MS-Reader application."

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test 10K Special DVD here right now!!!
Nearly all of our first 10,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have
regular needs for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby <gbnewby AT pglaf.org> ,
if you can help.


*** Progress Report

[Disclaimer:  We have several people and programs who count
up the Project Gutenberg eBooks and help create the statistics
we provide.  Every once in a while these don't agree, and we
have numbers that slightly disagree, even as to the number of
weeks in a given year. . .for example, 2003 has 53 Wednesdays,
so we will have 53 Newsletters, and thus will count 53 weeks,
at least some of us will. . . .   ;-)   This week is unusual,
because we are in the process of reestablishing our databases
after reaching eBook #10,000 a few weeks ago, and the programs
are not yet back to running at full capacity.  Thus, we have
had several mere mortals counting up the books and disagreeing
on how many there are.  I counted 87, George counted 84, and
one day we didn't get any reports at all, so we could both be
somewhat off.  Hopefully next week we will get back to normal.]


    In the first 10.50 months of this year, we produced 3,653 new eBooks.

     It took us from 1971 to 2001 to produce our first 3,653 eBooks!

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS

EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???


Statistical Review

In the 46 weeks of this year, we have produced 3653 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2002 to produce our FIRST 3653 eBooks!!!

         That's 46 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With 10,396 eBooks online as of November 19, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.96 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.57 when we had 6297 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing $.61 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 10,396 eBooks in 32 Years and 4.50 Months We Averaged
      321 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       27 Per Month
      .88 Per Day

At 3,653 eBooks Done In The 315 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     11.3 Per Day
     79.4 Per Week
    347.9 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


From Newsscan:


[I Know People Like This!!!]

HELP! I'M BEING HELD PRISONER BY MY TIVO!
TiVo -- the personal video recorder that cleverly records programs all day
on its hard drive based on the preferences of owners -- is being blamed for
turning otherwise-casual TV watchers into slaves shackled to their sofas,
unable to keep up with the flood of their favorite shows. Fanatical TiVo
users complain that their hard drives -- which come in either 40-hour or
80-hour sizes -- quickly fill up with programs they can't bear to delete,
but don't have time to watch. "For something that is supposed to be
relaxing and unwinding at the end of the day, you (think), 'Wow! I have a
lot of shows to watch,'" says Scott Bedard, technology director at an
online media company in San Francisco. Kevin Coto, a financial systems
consultant in New York, can relate: "I get to the point now where I skip
going to the gym so I can keep up with watching 'Dawson's Creek' reruns,"
which are broadcast for two hours each day. "I look forward to when they
end so I won't be so stressed." Nevertheless, most TiVo aficionados can't
imagine life without their favorite device. "If the box was broken I would
have to go out and buy a new one right away. I can't see myself going a
week without it," says Coto. (Reuters 11 Nov 2003)

[Will 100's of Millions of Present Day TVs End Up In Our Landfills?]

'MUST CARRY'? MAYBE NOT
The Federal Communications Commission plans to reject a request by TV
broadcasters to force cable companies to show both digital and analog
versions of network programs to expand the television audience to viewers
who own new high-definition TV sets. Cable companies oppose a so-called dual
"must-carry" requirement because it would force them to duplicate their
current network programming, and perhaps squeez out other cable channels.
All five FCC commissioners have decided individually to deny the
broadcasters' request, and Legg Mason analyst Blair Levin says,
"Commissioners seem to think there'd be too much of a burden on cable
without sufficient public benefit."

FCC WANTS TO EXPAND WIRELESS TO UNDERSERVED AREAS
The Federal Communications Commission is reserving a new portion of
high-frequency spectrum for wireless Internet users to encourage the spread
of high-speed data access in rural and other underserved areas. Although
WiFi networks are in widespread use in coffee shops and hotel lobbies across
the country, the goal now is to expand high-speed data connections to
sparsely populated communities and entire neighborhoods.

Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media


GDP IS LITERALLY A DILUTED SPIN DOCTORING OF GNP

GDP = Gross Domestic Product  GNP = Gross National Product


Do you ever wonder why Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings
and even Jim Lehrer started reading off GDP statistics instead
of GNP numbers?

It's just more spin doctoring to make the U.S. economy not
look as weak as it really is.  I wondered about his when it
started, and downloaded much of the following:

It is literally impossible to count every single product the U.S.
makes and every single hour of labor we provide. Therefore our GNP
is only an estimate. The way the government figures GNP is to put
products and services into five major categories: consumer (C),
investment (I), government spending (G), exports (X), and imports (M).

GNP = C+I+G+X-M is the formula. We add up the first four categories,
then subtract our imports because imports, of course, are not made in
this country. Lately the U.S. has not really counted exports and imports.
The government is now just adding up C+I+G and forgetting about the
X and M. This new measure is called Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
The formula is GDP=C+I+G. Notice that GDP is actually larger than GNP
because the dollar value of our imports is greater than the dollar value
of our exports. By using GDP, our economy doesn't show up as being as weak
due to the fact our imports outweigh our exports by a huge amount.

This is now simply eliminated from the news by the stroke of a gov't pen.

Try counting up just how much of the Evening News is written by such pens.

We noticed another one of these since writing the above:

re:  the news about the U.S. economy, particularly the NON-trickling-down
of the recent economic booms to the public.  You've probably all heard a
few reports that unemployment is finally down, even to the point of going
back a few months and saying, "Oops!  Those were really UP. . .NOT down."

However, the previous booms, much larger and longer than at present, if
you can call that a boom, never "trickled-down" to any real improvement
in the public buying power. . .nothing in the past several decades.

One way you can tell the Spin Doctors are in total control, is that none
of the reports being issued are continuing to say "seasonally adjusted."

Obviously right now there is a serious "seasonal" boom in employment,
as all the retail outlets have hired on every possible employable person
for "only 68 more shopping days until Christmas," which obviously slants
the employment figures for October, November and December, and "Back To
School" slanted those for August and September.  Once the post-holiday
figures come out in February and March, things may look different.
