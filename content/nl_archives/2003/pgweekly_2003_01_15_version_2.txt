PGWeekly_January_15.txt

**The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, January 15, 2003*
******eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Over 31 Years******

***

Last Week We Said:

"This is rather an *emergency* edition of the newsletter, as a LOT of email
has been lost, and many functions of my mainframe are not back online so I
am VERY limited in what and how I can do things right now."

We ended up with one less than we thought, so last week's total was 26 and
the grand total was 6,769.  Also reported 105 new eBooks, there were 115 !

My apologies for the errors, it was a challenge just doing the Newsletter.

***

Also, you may note we are working up a slightly new Newsletter format, and
your suggestions and comments are important to us; let us now how you feel.
We have combined most of the statistical information into one section, and
thus reduced much of the redundancy.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!


Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


We will also have this
new address in Chicago!


Charles Aldarondo
701 Riverside Drive
Park Ridge, IL 60068


Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

From: Miranda van de Heijning <m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com>
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the 2 weeks of this year, we have produced 101 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1993 to produce our *FIRST* 101 eBooks!!!

         That's 2 WEEKS as Compared to 22 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 6,844 eBooks online as of January 15, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.46 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.29 when we had 4376 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.83 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS OFFER ONLINE COURSES
Elite schools like Harvard University, which largely have avoided the
"distance-learning" boom, are bowing to the popularity of online education
and are beginning to offer a few courses via the Internet. Harvard's
fledgling effort is a master's degree program in public health set to start
in 2004. Brown University is participating in a consortium of schools
developing an online medical-school curriculum, and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, which has a small master's program in engineering
offered partly online, is exploring degree-granting distance learning in a
joint venture with Cambridge University in England. The University of
California at Berkeley offered its first all-online undergraduate course on
gemology last semester, and Stanford University is expanding its online
engineering master's program to include a fourth discipline --
bioinformatics. "The No. 1 reason people take this way of learning is
convenience," says Michael Lambert, executive director of the Distance
Education and Training Coucil. He estimates that 2.5 million U.S. students
took online courses for credit last year. (Wall Street Journal 15 Jan 2003)

SUN AND MICROSOFT GET SET FOR JAVA LEGAL BATTLE
Sun and Microsoft are appearing in federal court to argue their positions
before U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz, who will be ruling on Sun's
request for an injunction requiring Windows to include Sun's latest Java
software immediately, pending resolution of the larger Sun lawsuit against
Microsoft. Sun claims Microsoft has gained an unfair advantage by shipping
Windows with a version of Java that is both outdated and strongly biased
toward Windows, even though Java is meant to make it possible for programs
to run on all computers, regardless of the operating system.

[You might have heard this here first, only we weren't quite as tough
on Mr. Case as was the New York Times, though he may have deserved it.]

AOL TIME WARNER: SYNERGY/SHMINERGY
The resignation of supersalesman and high-tech "visionary" Steve Case as
chairman of AOL Time Warner marks an obvious admission of the failure of
that company's merger, which was intended to create synergy between an "old
economy" publishing and media empire and a "new economy" Internet venture.
New York Times journalist Steve Lohr says the idea was for AOL to give Time
Warner "sex" and Time Warner to give AOL "class." Industry analysts are now
suggesting that the company will succeed only if it undergoes a serious
attitude adjustment; Jordan Rohan of Soundview Technology Group says:
"If AOL continues to tilt at windmills in terms of trying to generate
spectacular growth, I think it will be a waste of shareholders' capital.
If they begin to treat AOL as a mature business and focus on consistent
returns, I think they can succeed. Case's departure could accelerate
that shift."   (New York Times 14 Jan 2003)

MUSIC, TECH GROUPS REACH COMPROMISE ON COPYRIGHT ISSUES
The Recording Industry Association of America, the Business Software
Alliance and the Computer Systems Policy Project have hammered out a
compromise agreement that they say will protect copyrights on music and
movies without the need for further government intervention. The pact is
intended to head off efforts by Congress to legislate the inclusion of
government-approved copy restriction technology in all new "digital media
devices." This latest agreement, described by participants as a "landmark
consensus," politically isolates the powerful Motion Picture Association of
America, which was noticeably absent from the negotiations. MPAA has
aggressively advocated new government requirements for built-in locking
controls on new devices, such as DVD players. (AP 14 Jan 2003)

VCR TO GET NEW INITIALS: R.I.P.

[You definitely heard this one here first!]

The VCR is dead (or dying), long live the DVD (at least for a little while,
for crying out loud). Stores like Circuit City and Barnes & Noble's either
are sharply reducing their inventories of VHS tapes or no longer carrying
them at all. (The video category of Best Buy's offerings is already more
than 80% DVD.) And the storyline is the same out in Hollywood: MGM
Entertainment's VHS library now numbers only 200 films (compared to 1,800
at one previous point), and Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment is phasing
out certain VHS catalog titles once they are released on DVD. Industry
analyst Tom Adams says, "The issue was always will VHS have the stink of
death of the eight-track tape. By now it's pretty clear that it will."

U.S. TECH COMPANIES RANK LOW IN RECYCLING EFFORTS
The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) has released its annual Computer
Report Card comparing the environmental records of 28 high-tech firms, and
reports that most U.S. companies lag behind their Japanese competitors when
it comes to recycling equipment and safe disposal of hazardous substances
used in the manufacturing process. Of the companies surveyed, only Fujitsu
received a passing grade. It's one of a handful of Japanese companies that
has sought to eliminate toxic chemicals by developing and using lead-free
products. "The leadership continues to be by and large the Japanese
companies, and the U.S. companies tend to be far behind," says SVTC founder
Ted Smith. "A lot of (U.S. manufacturers') initiatives are piecemeal and
not really designed to address the vast majority of consumer concerns.
There is still an enormous amount of computer waste being exported to
China." The Computer Report Card notes that some U.S. companies use a
double standard when it comes to recycling. Divisions located in Europe and
Japan, where safe recycling is mandated by law, have implemented programs
but their U.S. operations have not. Meanwhile, Congressman Mike Thompson
(D-Calif.) has introduced a bill that would require the EPA to create
grants for private and governmental organizations to develop computer
recycling programs and the National Electronics Product Stewardship
Initiative is working on a nationwide plan for recycling obsolete
electronic devices. (Wired.com 10 Jan 2003)

IBM RENTS OUT SUPERCOMPUTING POWER

[The Return of Timesharing!]

IBM has launched a new program to rent out processing power on its
supercomputers, and has signed up Petroleum Geo-Services, a petrochemical
company, as its first customer. PGS has about 1,000 of its own
dual-processor Linux computers clustered into a single computing resource,
but it's renting another 400 from Big Blue, says a company spokesman. The
new service reflects IBM's push toward "utility computing," which enables
companies with fluctuating needs for computing power to pay for it as they
use it. An e-commerce operation, for instance, may need to beef up its
processing power during the busy holiday shopping season, but that demand
drops off in January. IBM also expects to find many of its customers in the
petrochemical and life sciences industries. (CNet News.com 8 Jan 2003)

RETINAL SCANNING AT U.K. SCHOOL
The Venerable Bede school in London will use advanced eye-recognition
software to determine which students are to be billed for their lunches and
which may eat for free because they are poor. The school decided to use the
technology to protect poor children from being ridiculed by the more
well-off children. [As an historical aside, it might be noted that the
concern for poor would probably please the school's namesake. Venerable
Bede, the 8th century monk best known for his history of ecclesiastical
history, said on his deathbed: "I have a few treasures in my box, some
pepper and napkins and incense. Run quickly and fetch the priests of our
monastery, and I will share among them such little presents as God has
given me."] The school's headmaster said that the software will also be
used in the library for book check-out and return but added: "This is not a
James Bond school for spies... This is not science fiction. This is
technology that exists." (USA Today 9 Jan 2003)

WRITER OF DECSS PROGRAM ACQUITTED
In a blow to the U.S. film industry, Norwegian teen Jon Lech Johansen
was found innocent on all counts in a complaint filed against him for
violating computer break-in laws by the U.S. Motion Picture Association
and the DVD Copy Control Association in January 2000. Now 19, "DVD-Jon"
was 15 when he wrote and posted on the Internet the DeCSS software,
which decodes the Content Scrambling System (CSS) used by the film
industry to prevent illegal copying of DVD films. CSS also prevents
consumers from playing DVDs on certain devices, however, and from
making legal copies of DVDs. Head Judge Irene Sogn ruled that there was
no proof that Johansen or others had used the program for illegal
purposes and that consumers have rights to DVDs obtained legally "even if
the films are played in a different way than the makers had foreseen."
No decision has been made about an appeal in the case.

MICROSOFT BACKS AWAY FROM .NET BRANDING STRATEGY

[Could this also be due to backlash from the "real" .net community?"]

Less than six months after Microsoft announced that its next major
operating system would be called "Windows .NET Server 2003," the
company has decided to call the product simply "Windows Server 2003."
The change is part of Microsoft's revised approach to marketing its
NET technology, which is designed to support Web services. After
several months of attaching the .NET tag to most of its products,
Microsoft now will simply refer to those products as ".NET connected,"
indicated with a logo. Ted Schadler of Forrester Research said
Microsoft's strategy should never have been to lump everything under
the .NET umbrella, which many consumers did not understand and found
mysterious. The .NET technology included in Microsoft's products will
not change, but the ".NET connected" logo can be applied to independent
software vendors' products based on the technology, according to an
official from Microsoft.

IBM TO PROVIDE SUPERCOMPUTING ON DEMAND

More about "The New Timesharing"]

IBM recently announced its supercomputing-on-demand service, targeted
to businesses whose computing needs are cyclical, that offers an
alternative to the costly practice of building and maintaining computer
infrastructure used only during busy periods. The service uses a Linux
cluster of rack servers based on Intel's Xeon processor or a network
of UNIX servers running IBM's Power4 processors. Customers sign a
contract with IBM detailing the project length and resources required,
with price contingent on these factors. PGS Data Processing, an energy
company, has signed up for the Linux-Intel service. The clusters are
currently located at IBM's facility in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., with plans
to roll the technology out to IBM data centers worldwide. IBM hopes to
evolve the technology to the point where clients could access computer
resources like "flipping a light switch."

REPORT CHARGES E-RATE PROGRAM RIDDLED WITH FRAUD
A report from the Center for Public Integrity says that the federal
government's E-Rate program is rife with "fraud and financial
shenanigans." The E-Rate program gives subsidies for telecommunications
projects and is credited with bringing Internet access to thousands of
schools and libraries that would otherwise have difficulty affording
them. The report is based largely on information collected by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which, according to the author
of the report, "found problems everywhere they've looked, and they
haven't looked very hard." A review by Arthur Anderson uncovered
several million dollars' worth of "inappropriate" payments under the
program, and recently the first criminal charges were filed against a
New York company for attempting to steal millions of dollars from the
program through misrepresentation. The inspector general of the FCC
said the program is "subject to unacceptably high risk of malfeasance."
Representatives from the Universal Service Administrative Company,
which administers E-Rate for the FCC, and from the American Library
Association defended the program, arguing that although some abuse is
likely, the problem is not excessive and may turn out to be less than
indicated by the Center for Public Integrity's report.

PUBLISHER ACCEPTING DISSERTATIONS AND THESES ONLINE
Developers of a new online-submission tool for dissertations and
master's theses hope the system will make the submission
process--required by most institutions--easier for students and will
speed availability of the papers. ProQuest Information and Learning
receives about 55,000 dissertations and theses each year, but only
about 3,000 are submitted online. The $55 fee for submissions is the
same for online and paper submissions, and some observers predicted
that the ability to submit papers electronically will encourage
students to include less traditional features in their work, such as
embedded databases or audio and video files. The University of Texas at
Austin, which has one of the nation's largest populations of graduate
students, will begin testing the system this month, and it will be
available to other institutions later this year.

NEW PLAGIARISM SERVICE FOR BRITISH UNIVERSITIES
The Plagiarism Advisory Service, based at the University of
Northumbria, is a new electronic plagiarism-detection service available
to all British colleges and universities. Papers are returned four
hours after being submitted to the service and are color-coded to
indicate the level of matching to documents available on the Internet.
Red indicates that more than 75 percent of the text has been copied,
blue means less than 10 percent, and other colors are spread in
between. Instructors also see which Web site(s) the copied content
comes from. Because of the ease with which students can cut and paste
content from the Web, plagiarism is a growing problem in the United
Kingdom, as well as in many other parts of the world.
