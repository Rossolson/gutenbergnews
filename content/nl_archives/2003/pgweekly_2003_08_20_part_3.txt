REMINDER: GUTINDEX eBook numbers now have five digits.!

As we have recently posted our first eBook with a five digit eBook number
(#10701), we have made an adjustment to the GUTINDEXes to accomodate this
change. Basically, the alignment of eBook numbers less than 10,000 have
been moved one space to the right.  This change is also reflected in the
eBook listings below.

Note:  this listing best viewed with a fixed-width font, such as Courier New
        or similar.

TOTAL COUNT as of today, Wed 20 Aug 2003:   9,079 (incl. 263 Aus.).

Last week the Total Count was 9,036, including 262 at PG of Australia.
This week we added 44 new (incl. 1 at PG of Australia); however, we had to
remove one posted previously, for a net gain of 43 for the week (details
below).

RESERVED count:   39

A "?" at the beginning of the filename indicates that the eBook is
available in both 7-bit (plain text) & 8-bit (accented) versions.
