NEWS

New website for literature

http://litteratureaemporter.free.fr

My personnal library made accessible for all. French and English literature
(mostly from the Project Gutenberg) presented in the HTML format. Allowing
readers greater flexibility in font size, color and the background color
for easier reading. The texts are split into chapters to ease reading and
the PG licence or ABU licence (French counterpart for the PG) are included
when available. Footnotes are visible in "balloons" when the mouse is over
a link in the text and disapears when the mouse leaves the link.{This is
really cool to see. Ed}

These HTML pages have been tested with the following browsers : MS Internet
Explorer 5.0 and 6.0, Netscape Communicator 4.6 and 7.0, Mozilla 1.2.1
(under Windows 95/98 and XP) without any problem except for minor
differences in presentation due to the browsers. Cookies are not used in any
way, no popups, no annoying things like on many other sites. Just upload a
zip file containing a book, expand it on your hard drive and have a good
read !

Many, many, many thanks to the PG members who provide us with so many books.

The "Public Domain" and Copyright Law in Australia
By Col Choat

There has been some discussion recently about copyright provisions in
different parts of the world. Some pundits have even suggested, perhaps
facetiously, that Project Gutenberg might better be based in another country,
such as Australia, (henceforth described as Oz, as in "Oztralia", as we
pronounce it) where the copyright laws seem more liberal with regard to
releasing books into the public domain.

In this regard, it is important to understand the copyright law provisions in
Oz. The Australian Copyright Council has a web site at
http://copyright.org.au and states that "There is no system of registration
for copyright protection in Australia. You do not need to publish your work,
to put a copyright notice on it, or to do anything else to be covered by
copyright--the protection is free and automatic. There are no forms to fill
in, and there are no fees to be paid. You do not have to send your work to
the Australian Copyright Council or to anyone else. . . As a result of
international treaties, such as the Berne Convention, Australian copyright
works are protected in most other countries, and copyright works from most
other countries are protected in Australia."

Under Oz copyright law, literary, dramatic, and musical work published,
performed, communicated, or recorded and offered for sale (anywhere in the
world) in an author's lifetime are, in Oz, protected for the life of the
author plus fifty years from the end of the year of the author's death. After
the protection period, they enter the "public domain". However, they may
remain copyrighted in other countries. In countries where copyright
protections can extend more than 50 years past an author's death, the
author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral rights to
oversee the work in those countries.

During 2003, if an author died before 31 December 1952, any work published in
his/her lifetime is now in the public domain in Oz. If a work is first
published AFTER the author's death, the protection period is 50 years from
the end of the year of FIRST publication, performance or broadcast.

Once copyright has expired it cannot be revived by subsequent publication, or
otherwise. New editions cannot extend copyright, however new work (such as an
introduction) will be copyright. Translators, editors, and illustrators have
similar rights to those of the author of the work.

Because we, in Oz, are not concerned about editions and publication dates,
copyright checking is quite straightforward. The volunteer (and eventually
_I_) must simply be satisfied that the author died before 1 Jan 1953 (during
2003) and that the work was first published during the author's lifetime.
Naturally, if the work is a translation the same rules apply to the
translator. If the work was published posthumously, the protection period is
50 years from first publication. That's it! Easy, isn't it.

Of course, if the author of a book posted at the Project Gutenberg in the US
died AFTER 1952, then he/she is not in the public domain in Oz. Hence,
Hillaire Belloc (1870-1953) could have works at PG in the US, none of which
would be in the public domain in Oz until 1 January, 2004.

An Australian author, Norman Lindsay (1879-1969), wrote books which were first
published before 1923, and which may be in the public domain in the US,
however NONE of his works will be in the public domain in Oz until 2020. This
point is often overlooked by the pundits who advocate Project Gutenberg in
the US moving to another country.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can

help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY

Literary (mostly) Dates of Interest this week

Birthdays this week include Charles Darwin (today) author of 'On the origin
of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured
races in the struggle of life (Phew!), Sax Rohmer (15th) best known for his
creation of master criminal Dr. Fu Manchu, Georges Simenon (13th) creator
of the marvellous Inspector Maigret, Andre Breton (18th) French poet and
member of the surrealist movement and Nobel Literature Prize winner Toni
Morrison (18th). You will find etexts for both Charles Darwin and Sax
Rohmer on the Project Gutenberg website.

On St Valentine's day we have the anniversary of the death of PG Wodehouse,
and on 15th Feb celebrate the 84th birthday of UPS. (Let's hope that first
parcel has made it by now. An article in my local newspaper this week
reported the delivery of a holiday postcard 98 years after it was first
posted!)

And slightly late, but definitely worthy of a mention. February 3rd saw
the 535th anniversary of the death of Johannes Gutenberg.

Many thanks to George Davis for his suggestions about this feature.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

STATISTICAL REVIEW

(This number includes the etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)


In the first 6 weeks of the new year, we have produced 350 new eBooks.

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production.

With 7093 eTexts online as of February 11, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.41 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.19 when we had 4559 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7093 books each costing $0.78 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7093 books each costing 35% less a year later???


At 7093 eBooks in 31 Years We Averaged 19.07 eBooks per month

At 350 eBooks Done in 2003 We Averaged 63.00 eBooks per month

Australia's first literature
----------------------------

The first fleet of ships which arrived in Botany Bay (Sydney) from England, in
January 1788, heralded the beginning of white settlement in Australia. Watkin
Tench (1759-1833), Captain of the Marines, was one of the four captains who
made the voyage. In his autobiographical "A Narrative of the Expedition to
Botany Bay" Tench states that "our number was...twelve sail: His Majesty's
ships 'Sirius', 'Hyena', and 'Supply', three Victuallers with two years
stores and provisions on board for the Settlement, and six Transports, with
troops and convicts.  In the transports were embarked four captains, twelve
subalterns, twenty-four serjeants and corporals, eight drummers, and one
hundred and sixty private marines, making the whole of the military force,
including the Major Commandant and Staff on board the Sirius, to consist of
two hundred and twelve persons, of whom two hundred and ten were volunteers.
The number of convicts was five hundred and sixty-five men, one hundred and
ninety-two women, and eighteen children; the major part of the prisoners were
mechanics and husbandmen, selected on purpose by order of Government."

In "A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay" and his subsequent work "A
Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson", Tench provides a first
hand account of the voyage and then goes on to describe the subsequent
settlement in Sydney, New South Wales. He details the natural environment of
Port Jackson and its environs; the efforts to establish food production; the
exploratory trips into the hinterland; and, most interestingly, the first
interaction between Europeans and the Australian Aborigines.

This is a remarkable eye-witness account by a thoughtful, humane man who was
also a talented writer. Tench was interested in everyone and everything
around him. These two works may be considered the first works of Australian
literature. Both are both available at Project Gutenberg
(http://gutenberg.net) or from http://www.gutenberg.net.au/tench.html.

Headlines From Newsscan

DELL FLIPS THE OFF SWITCH ON FLOPPIES
Dell announced it will stop installing floppy drives in its desktop
computers next month, offering them only as an option. "What Dell has done,
I expect every major vendor to do in the next 12 months," says technology
consultant Tim Bajarin. "The utility of the floppy disk is just no longer
there for most users." Instead of the floppy, Dell brand 16-megabyte USB
flash memory drives will be offered in high-end models, and the company
will consider making them standard equipment on all desktops, depending on
customer response. (AP 6 Feb 2003)

HP OFFERS CONSUMER INCENTIVES FOR COMPUTER RECYCLING
Hewlett-Packard will offer e-coupons exchangeable for HP products when
users recycle old computer hardware through the company. The coupons will
range from $20 to $50 in value, depending on the amount a consumer spends
on recycling services, which cost from $17 to $30 depending on the size of
the equipment to be recycled. An HP executive said: "This is a way to learn
what our customers want. Do they even want an incentive? Or do they just
want to fill out a form and leave a box on their doorstep? We know that
waste is a growing problem in the industry, but no one has really studied
what consumers want to do to get rid of their computers.'' (AP/San Jose
Mercury News 6 Feb 2003)

SALES TAXES CREEP ONTO THE WEB
Internet sales traditionally have been exempted from sales taxes, providing
the buyer lived in a different state than the e-tailer they purchased from.
But a collective push by states to institute Internet sales taxes is
gaining momentum, and several big-name retailers -- including Marshall
Fields, Target and Wal-Mart -- are cooperating. The retailers say they're
simply streamlining bookkeeping to accommodate situations where customers
purchase on the Web and then return or exchange those items at their
physical stores. But according to washingtonpost.com, the retailers have
ulterior motivations. In return for collecting the taxes, "38 states and
the District of Columbia agreed to absolve the retailers for any liability
for taxes not previously collected on Internet sales." And while the stakes
are high for states -- a University of Tennessee report estimated that
states could collectively lose more than $45 billion in Internet sales tax
revenue in 2006 -- there's no groundswell of opposition from consumers.
Jupiter Research yesterday released a study that indicates most online
shoppers are indifferent to the issue, with most online shoppers unaware
that they can shop around on different sites to avoid the extra charge, and
some respondents saying they wouldn't choose one retailer over another just
because there was no sales tax. (Washington Post 6 Feb 2003)

LIGHTBULB IDEA
Incandescent lightbulbs, neon tubes and fluorescent lamps are expected to
go the way of the gas lamp: into the history books. The emerging
"solid-state lighting" industry, based on LED (light-emitting diode)
microchips is expected to make its presence felt in the general home and
office lighting market as early as 2007. Currently used mainly in
large-scale projects such as the Nasdaq sign in Times Square, Chicago's
Goodman Theatre, or the White House Christmas tree, offer huge performance
advantages. An example: an LED traffic light consumes 80% less electricity
and lasts ten times longer than a traditional light. (New York Times 11 Feb
2003)

FBI HUNTS EBAY DATA THIEF
FBI officials say that a hacker used a computer system at the
University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) to steal private
financial information from eBay users. According to complaints, eBay
users received e-mails that appeared to come from eBay telling them
that their accounts were suspended until they verified personal
information, including credit card number and mother's maiden name. A
link embedded in the e-mail messages took users to a Web page that
seemed to belong to UNCC. The hacker evidently used a university
computer server for two hours or more February 2 to post the page
before technicians shut it down, according to university spokeswoman
Karin Steinbrenner, although the hacker does not appear to be a UNCC
student or employee.

PUBLISHERS SETTLE ON WEB POP-UP ADS
Major newspaper publishers, including the New York Times Company,
Gannett, Dow Jones, and others have settled a lawsuit filed in June
with Gator Corporation over pop-up ads placed on their Web sites
without permission. Gator's software, eWallet, collects user password
and shipping information when customers visit different Web sites and
simultaneously displays pop-up ads on top of those sites. Plaintiffs
argued that this practice obscured their Web sites, while Gator
defended it as similar to instant messaging. The terms of the
settlement have not been disclosed.
