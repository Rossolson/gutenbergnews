Requests For Assistance:

For me, we'd like to have one of these, will pay for it plus shipping:

For value for money you can't beat the Franklin eBookMan, out of
production but currently on sale in the US for $30 at Fry's. The eBM is
quirky but lovable and has gradually accumulated a reasonable collection
of software in addition to the standard PDA bits and pieces, including
the MobiPocket Reader. Top-end models have a backlit screen. Ideal for
beginners. The main drawback is the daft protection system which
requires each individual eBM to be separately registered with Franklin
before it can be used - so no in-store demos, and if you lose the
operating system you've got to go online on your own PC to download it
again. It supports MMC cards but not Sdata.

Project Gutenberg--Canada will be starting up soon,
please let us know if you would like to volunteer!
Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,
and we have volunteers working on both of these.
We will also be seeking volunteers from others of
the "life +50" countries.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

We need a volunteer near Chicago to help feed books to our newest
super-scanner. . .we have a stack of 200 waiting, and just cannot
stay away to feed them in 24/7.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Statistical Review

In the 16 weeks of this year, we have produced 1000 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our FIRST 1000 eBooks!!!

         That's 16 WEEKS as Compared to 26 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 7,743 eBooks online as of April 16, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.29 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.96 when we had 5113 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing $.67 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 7743 eBooks in 31 3/4 Years We Averaged
    244 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]

MICROSOFT SETTLES FLORIDA CLASS ACTION SUIT
Microsoft has settled a class action lawsuit that claimed that the company
violated a Florida state law against unfair trade practices in the manner
it sold operating system and applications software. Under the terms of the
agreement, Microsoft will provide vouchers worth up to $202 million for
people to buy computers and related products from any manufacturer.
Vouchers will be available to class action participants who purchased a
Microsoft operating system, productivity suite, spreadsheet or
wordprocessing software between Nov. 16, 1995 and Dec. 31, 2002. Half of
the total value of any unclaimed vouchers will be donated to Florida's most
needy public schools and the other half will revert to Microsoft.

CNN DEFENDS ITSELF AGAINST NEWS-FILTERING CHARGES
In a memo to his staff, CNN top news executive Eason Jordan has denied that
his motive for failing over a 12-year period to report horrors of the
Saddam Hussein regime was to keep the CNN Baghdad bureau open. "A number of
people have told me CNN should have closed its Baghdad bureau, helped
everyone who told me the horror stories flee Iraq, with me thereafter
telling those stories publicly long before now. While that is a noble
thought, doing so was not a viable option." He says that such victims would
not have left their country simply to be able to share their stories with
the world. "So we reported on Iraq's human rights record from outside Iraq
and featured many interviews with Iraqi defectors who described the
regime's brutality in graphic detail. When an Iraqi official, Abbas
al-Janabi, defected after his teeth were yanked out with pliers by Uday
Hussein's henchmen, I worked to ensure the defector gave his first TV
interview to CNN. He did." (Atlanta Journal-Constitution 16 Apr 2003)

COMPUTER MAKERS TARGET RECYCLING-FRIENDLY DESIGN
Computer makers such as Hewlett-Packard and Dell, which recently have
started getting involved in the recycling of their obsolete machines, are
beginning to change the way they build their products, making it easier to
dispose of them in an environmentally friendly way. "The more they become
familiar with these end-of-life concerns, the more likely it is they close
the loop," says Ted Smith, executive director of Silicon Valley Toxics
Coalition, which is part of a group that advocates all electronics makers
taking responsibility for their products' disposal. The biggest challenge,
says Smith, is redesigning the products so they don't use so many toxic
compounds to begin with. Right now, Japanese companies are ahead of the
game, with many manufacturers already establishing goals and timetables for
removing lead and the bromine currently used in plastics as a
fire-retardant. "They are being driven, as everyone else is, by European
regulations," says Smith. For instance, NEC introduced a PC last year that
has a completely recyclable case and whose circuit boards are entirely
lead-free. Meanwhile, HP has a working prototype of an inkjet printer that
features a biodegradable plastic shell made from corn rather than
petroleum. And Dell has revamped its assembly process to make it easier to
take the machines apart at the end. The average desktop can now be
disassembled in two minutes; more complicated workstations take about twice
that long. (CNet News.com 22 Apr 2003)

ASK JEEVES GETS A MAKEOVER
In a bid to stay in the game in the fiercely competitive search engine
market, Ask Jeeves has revamped its consumer search engine tool, following
the lead of Yahoo and Google. Ask Jeeves Web properties president Steve
Berkowitz calls the upgrade "the beginning of a new direction for Ask
Jeeves" and a significant improvement on search in general. "Search is
imperfect because we are asking technology to respond to human input, which
is based on the way people think. We believe great search is a combination
of science and art." Although the new search engine relies heavily on
technology, query results will also include suggestions from Ask Jeeves'
editorial team, blending hand-selected content and answers with automated
responses. The company says its new service will make it easier to find
pictures and news headlines, and will include its popular clarification
tools (for refining a search) and automated spell checker feature. "The
battle right now is focused on the user experience," says a Forrester
Research analyst, who notes that while the top five companies are sparring
over the consumer market, the enterprise market is still wide open and is
slated to become an important part of the overall search business.

BIGGER ONLINE ADS SQUEEZE WEB CONTENT
Several top online publishers, including New York Times Digital, Forbes.com
and CBSMarketwatch.com, have adopted new online ad formats that give
marketers a full half-page to tout their products and services. Others,
such as USAToday.com, are expected to follow suit. "The goal is to make it
easier on the traditional advertiser and to speak their language -- a
half-page ad is something they're used to in print," says Dan Silmore,
director of marketing for CBSMarketwatch.com. The new format is part of the
industry's shift away from banner ads and Web publishers hope the new
dimensions will be approved as a standard size by the Interactive
Advertising Bureau. Michael Zimbalist, executive director of the Online
Publishers Association, says that the industry hasn't "nailed a final set
of online ad units," but is still experimenting to see which formats
advertisers find most attractive. "The banner wasn't a great medium for
either creative or information-rich advertising. This is part of an
increasing trend to have fewer but bigger ad units." But Web design expert
Jakob Nielsen says the half-page units are a move in the wrong direction.
"Ironically, the one type of ads that really work on the Web are the small,
text-only ads on search engines. I would advise other sites to take what works
and make it better rather than take what doesn't work and make it bigger."

AT&T TRIES TO COLLECT FROM VICTIMS OF PHONE VANDALS
AT&T has been trying to get reimbursement for long-distance phone calls
made by fraudulently hacking into the voicemail systems of the victims and
re-routing international collect calls placed as part of the scheme. The
calls were typically placed when the businesses were closed, and were
received by voicemail systems reprogrammed by the vandals to respond with
the answer "yes" to the automated AT&T query about whether the customer
agrees to accept charges for the call. Linda Sherry of Consumer Action
calls AT&T's demand that the victims of the fraud pay for the fraudulently
placed calls "outrageous." (New York Times 21 Apr 2003)

CNN GLITCH REVEALS PREMATURE OBITS
A glitch on the CNN.com Web site accidentally made available draft
obituaries written in advance for Dick Cheney, Ronald Reagan, Fidel Castro,
Pope John Paul II and Nelson Mandela. "The design mockups were on a
development site intended for internal review only," says a CNN
spokeswoman. "The development site was temporarily publicly available
because of human error." The pages were yanked about 20 minutes after being
exposed. (CNet News.com 17 Apr 2003)

DARPA REPORTEDLY REVOKES OPENBSD FUNDING
Funding from the U.S. military for the OpenBSD project has reportedly
been cancelled after the leader of the project made anti-war comments,
which were printed in a Canadian newspaper. Theo de Raadt, who is a
resident of Canada, expressed his opposition to the U.S. war in Iraq
and said he feels uneasy taking money from the U.S. military. He said
he tries to convince himself, however, that "our grant means a half of
a cruise missile doesn't get built." The funding comes from the U.S.
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the project is
handled through the University of Pennsylvania. According to de Raadt,
Jonathan Smith, a computer science professor at the university and head
of the project there, called last week to say that DARPA had pulled the
funding. A spokeswoman from DARPA denied that funding had been cut off.
She said the agency is simply conducting a review of the project and
will announce results when the review is complete.

FTC CRACKS DOWN ON PORN SPAMMER
The Federal Trade Commission asked the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, to bar Ballwin (a
suburb of St. Louis) resident Brian Westby from sending e-mail
containing deceptive subject lines, false reply information, and
pornographic material designed to steer recipients to an adult Web
site. The FTC claimed that the pornographic spam operation has grossed
more than $1 million in commissions and prompted almost 50,000 consumer
complaints in response to a recent bulk e-mail campaign. The suit is
the first to target deceptive subject lines and the second on
"spoofing," which is e-mail that uses false reply-to or from
information that leads recipients to assume an innocent third party
sent the message.

SURVEY FINDS ONE-QUARTER OF AMERICANS ARE OFFLINE
A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that almost
25 percent of Americans do not use the Internet. The number of people
dropping offline equals the number of new users, leading the
researchers to conclude that the 60 percent use of the Internet
measured in October 2001 is likely to persist. About 42 percent of
Americans say they do not use the Internet, but half have either used
it in the past or access it through other family members. Only 17
percent are classified as actual net dropouts, but this is an increase
from the 13 percent identified in a similar 2000 survey.

individuals for violations of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act, the
Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and the Washington Commercial
Electronic Mail Act. AOL is seeking at least $10 million in damages
from the defendants for sending approximately one billion unsolicited
e-mails to its customers, more than eight million of whom have filed
complaints with AOL. AOL is also fighting spam by supporting federal
anti-spam legislation, including the recently introduced CAN-SPAM Act,
and by taking technological steps to limit spam. According to an AOL
spokesman, the company has been blocking mail servers associated with
certain residential IP addresses that have been identified as sending spam.

MICROSOFT SETTLES FLORIDA SUIT
Microsoft has settled a class-action lawsuit with residents of Florida.
According to the suit, Microsoft violated trade practices in the way it
sold software, and consumers who purchased certain of the company's
products between late 1995 and the end of 2002 will be eligible for
vouchers totaling $202 million. The vouchers will be good for hardware
and software from any manufacturer. Details were not released about
when the vouchers will expire, but the settlement stipulates that half
of unclaimed vouchers will be donated to public schools. One public
school official called that part of the settlement "great news for
schools all across Florida," saying that "the timing is particularly
helpful" in the current budgetary situation.
