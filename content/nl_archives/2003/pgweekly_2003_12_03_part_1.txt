                          eBook Milestones


             We're ~6.4% Of The Way From 10,000 To 20,000!!!


                      10638 eBooks As Of Today!!!


      We're Already 1/16th Of The Way From 10,000 to 20,000!!!


It took 32.25 years from July, 1971 to October, 2003 to do our 1st 10,000

It took 7.17 years--September, 1996 to November, 2003 for our last 10,000

[From 638 to 10,638]

We hope to reach 20,000 eBooks in 2005. . . .


***

We have the first copy of our "10K Special" DVD nearly ready, more below.
Let me know you the URL to download, or need us to snail a copy to burn.
Sending out another copy today, but next week will be the last before I
hit the road to our conference in San Francisco.

Catalog Updates:  Thanks to the work of Marcello Perathoner,
there is no longer a delay getting new eBooks into our
searchable database at http://www.gutenberg.net.  Author and
title information, as well as links directly to the eBook's
files (in all available formats) are updated nightly.

and. . . .

A new page with eBooks posted (or changed) the day before:

http://www.gutenberg.net/gutenberg/browse/RECENT.HTM

***    gutenberg.net moving to ibiblio.org/gutenberg   ***

After many happy years at http://promo.net/pg, we have moved
gutenberg.net to a different server over the upcoming days.

Many Thanks To Promo.net!!!!!!!

There have been a few days of transition, as the Internet name servers
got their updates.  When the transfer is complete,   gutenberg.net
(including www.gutenberg.net)   will still work correctly, but will
point to our NEW Web pages at     http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg

Hopefully 99% of the bumps in the road caused by this are now over.

***  HOT Requests!!!

For those of you who are trying to get some PR for Project Gutenberg,
the UPI said this week:

"These are momentous times in the digital content industry. . . .

"Project Gutenberg - the pioneering and largest depository of free,
mostly "plain-vanilla" (text only) e-books - added the 10,000-th
title to its unsurpassed collection.  In the meantime, e-book
aggregators, such as blackmask.com, now proffer tens of thousands
of free titles for download in up to 8 file formats. Even Microsoft
has spent the last few months offering a free weekly selection of 3
commercial titles each, exclusively readable on its MS-Reader application."

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test 10K Special DVD here right now!!!
Nearly all of our first 10,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have
regular needs for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby <gbnewby AT pglaf.org> ,
if you can help.


*** Progress Report

[Disclaimer:  We have several people and programs who count
up the Project Gutenberg eBooks and help create the statistics
we provide.  Every once in a while these don't agree, and we
have numbers that slightly disagree, even as to the number of
weeks in a given year. . .for example, 2003 has 53 Wednesdays,
so we will have 53 Newsletters, and thus will count 53 weeks,
at least some of us will. . . .   ;-)   This week is unusual,
because we are in the process of reestablishing our databases
after reaching eBook #10,000 a few weeks ago, and the programs
are not yet back to running at full capacity.  Thus, we have
had several mere mortals counting up the books and disagreeing
on how many there are.  I counted 87, George counted 84, and
one day we didn't get any reports at all, so we could both be
somewhat off.  Hopefully next week we will get back to normal.]


    In the first 11.00 months of this year, we produced 3,907 new eBooks.

     It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our first 3,907 eBooks!

                That's 48 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 Years!

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM OUR MIRROR SITES

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://gutenberg.net/list.html  can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer.


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS--  Several Options In Progress!!!

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS

EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000

To get to a directory listing you can use either:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/1/
- or -
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/

. . .navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the
appropriate level, and then select the file you wish to download,
using your normal download procedures.


FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000:

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename and year you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???


Statistical Review

In the 48 weeks of this year, we have produced 3895 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2002 to produce our FIRST 3895 eBooks!!!

         That's 48 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With 10,638 eBooks online as of December 03, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.94 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.54 when we had 6479 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing $.60 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 10,638 eBooks in 32 Years and 5.00 Months We Averaged
      329 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       27 Per Month
      .88 Per Day

At 3,895 eBooks Done In The 336 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     11.6 Per Day
     81.1 Per Week
    354.1 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

TALKING NEWSPAPERS SOUND ALMOST HUMAN
The British Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) is teaming up with
Rhetorical Systems to provide partially sighted and blind people with
timely access to newspapers and magazines, using technology that "reads"
the stories in a very human-sounding voice. Rhetorical's rVoice
text-to-speech software is based on the voice files of real people and
sounds, and produces much more natural speech than traditional speech
synthesizers. Subscribers to the new service will receive a portable
AudioRead device that they can use to retrieve information from wherever
they happen to be. Unlike audiotapes used to deliver newspapers to the
visually impaired, AudioRead users can navigate the sections, skipping
between articles and sections as they choose. "We'll be able to produce 400
hours of audio in one hour," says RNIB technology expert Steve Tyler.
"The mainstay of our users who listen to books have never liked the idea of
synthetic speech, they've always wanted a real reader."

THIS NUMBER'S READY FOR PRIME TIME
Michigan State University grad student Michael Shafer has succeeded in
identifying the largest known prime number to date, using a distributed
computer network of more than 200,000 computers located around the world.
The new number is 6,320,430 digits long and is only the 40th Mersenne prime
to have ever been discovered (Mersenne primes are an especially rare breed
that take the form of 2-to-the-power-of-P, where P is also a prime number).
Shafer was taking part in the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)
project, when the new number popped up. "I had just finished meeting with
my advisor when I saw the computer had found a new prime. After a short
victory dance, I called up my wife and friends involved with GIMPS to share
the great news," said Shafer. (New Scientist 2 Dec 2003)

Sun Microsystems is opening a new center in Scotland to test
radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, in a move that signals the
company's desire to expand beyond the back office. Up until now, Sun has
best been known as a maker of servers used to power corporate networks and
Web sites. Now the company is branching out, selling software designed for
office desktops, for tracking retail sales in stores, and for downloading
games and tunes to mobile phones. "This allows Sun to sell the whole
ecosystem whereas previously we played into only one portion,"
says John Loiacono, VP of Sun's operating platforms group.

HP JOINS INTERNET MUSIC FRENZY
Hewlett-Packard is diving into the online music fray with a branded
Internet music store and a portable digital music player that will compete
with similar offerings from Apple and Dell. HP, which ranks No. 2 in PC
sales and No. 1 in printers, is the latest computer maker to aggressively
expand their consumer electronics business in the face of stagnant PC sales
and weakened corporate spending. In addition to the music venture, HP
recently indicated it would soon start selling flat screen TVs, following
in the footsteps of Gateway and Dell. (Financial Times 3 Dec 2003)

SPAMMERS TARGET ANTI-SPAM GROUPS WITH E-MAIL WORM
Virus experts say a new worm, dubbed W32/Mimail-L, has been unleashed by a
vengeful spammonger intent on paralyzing anti-spam groups via a crippling
barrage of data -- a so-called denial of service attack. "It's the third
Mimail variation to come after us, except this one is trying to do more,"
says Steve Linford, founder of the Spamhaus Project. The nasty worm comes
as an attachment to an e-mail from "Wendy" who describes an erotic
encounter and then offers photos. Clicking on the attachment launches the
worm. In a new twist, a follow-up e-mail is sent to the infected user
announcing that an order for a CD containing child pornography images will
be sent to their mailing address. Virus experts say the impact of this
latest worm has been minimal, compared with the problems caused by last
summer's plague of viruses, "but what this shows is that there is more
evidence that virus writers and spammers are now colluding," says Sophos
senior technology consultant Graham Cluley. (Reuters 2 Dec 2003)

Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media

Those of you who watch the evening news undoubtedly saw
a video tape made by some rebels in Iraq shooting a DHL
cargo plane with a shoulder fired SAM [Surface to Air Missle].
A U.S. helicopter can be seen cruising nearby in the tape.

The moment of the hit was edited out of all the American
media and they were sure to say that there was no evidence
that THIS missle was the cause of the damage to THAT plane.

The tape was received by a French journalist and then
relayed to the rest of the media.  The entire length is
some 6 minutes, and even the BBC didn't show all of it,
but it didn't appear as if they edited it internally,
as did their U.S. counterparts.

[For those of you unfamiliar with DHL shipping, think of
"Airborne" in the U.S., a competitor to Fed-X, UPS, etc.
DHL is larger than any of them, and even owns Airborne.

There is a date stamp on the videtape, but not a time stamp,
so we can't easily tell over how many minutes it was taken.
I'm sure someone will analyze the sun's position and should
be able to say over how many minutes the video was taken.
[Apparently someone already thought of this, and confirmed
that the sun's angle is consistent with the time of day:

"At approximately 6:30 GMT this morning, a DHL aircraft,
an Airbus A300 freighter, departing from Baghdad to Bahrain,
had to return to Baghdad and effect an emergency landing,"
company spokeswoman Patricia Thomson said in Brussels."

I saw what appeared to be the entire segment of tape on the
BBC World News including the moment when the missle hit.

You can find copies of this online:

KEYWORDS: ATTACK; BAGHDAD; DHL; FRANCE; JAPAN; SAM; SHOULDER;
MISSILE; TERROR; TERRORISTS; VIDEO

I just used "dhl, missle, videotape"

ANTI-FREE TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION. . .ECONOMIC HOME FRONT WARFARE!!!

In a "Think Globally, Act Locally" sort of response to Globalization,
some counties started advertising campaigns to encourage residents to
"Think Locally, Buy Locally," to keep revenues inside their counties.

This was a response to the building of large "Mega-Malls" that traded
in the retail arena with residents of multiple surrounding counties.

Since then, the "Mega-Mall" counties have retorted with the very same
campaign ads, encouraging their own resident to shop at home, rather
than supporting the non-local economies, and tax bases, of any of the
nearby counties.

If this trend continues, perhaps neighborhood stores will return, and
put the malls out of business, eh?

MORE ECONOMIC WARFARE, ON AN EVEN MORE LOCAL FRONT

Recent reports show that 60% of American workers are
planning to quit their jobs and go elsewhere to work
in the next two years. [Source NPR]

Indeed, other reports show that when employers snoop
on employees' email, most of their spying effort is
searching for keywords such as:  resume, job-search,
and other items that would indicate workers are not
satisfied with their current positions.

The reason for this may be that while only 25% are
willing to say they are dissatisfied with the job,
60% are searching for something else.

With this kind of transitional labor force, the U.S.
worker could easily become labeled as "part time,"
or "migrant". . .with most workers planning on the
move to a new job in two years. . . .

But isn't this exactly what U.S. businesses WANTED
to create?. . .a totally mobile workforce that will
move to a new location at the drop of a hat?

Of course, they ONLY wanted those workers to move
when and where they were told to, within the same
multi-national corporations, such as IBM, but it
was only a matter of time before such mobility
went outside the corporate walls with the advent
of a cannibalistic "headhunter" mentality. . . .

Just out:

(San Jose Mercury News 2 Dec, 2002)

About half the workers would switch jobs just to
get a signing bonus of $1,000 in stock!  Or even
just a better chance at earning a yearly bonus.
Apparently employees are also now willing to
consider that having their company get to know them
is of increasing importance, as companies are now
being bought and sold left and right. . . .

An engineer who quit when his company was bought out
confirmed this was a growing issue:

"You've got to know your employees. If you don't have a
personal relationship with them, somebody else will."

CORRECTION:

Only 40 minutes of TV programming per hour?

I mentioned that TV shows have 6 commercial breaks per hour,
but a recent show I logged showed 7 commercial breaks:
at 8, 15, 23, 33, 43, 52 and 58 minutes.  This seems opposite
to what I recall, as all 4 middle ones had about 10 minutes
between them, with only the first 2 and last 2 being shorter.
I recall that they used to get more often as the show went on,
with the first segment being the longest. . .I'll do more testing.
During the 7 breaks there were some 25 full length commericals,
3 or 4 to a break, along with about half as many promotional ads
for upcoming shows [some are as long as full length commericals].
The last break was an exception, as it contained only 2 full length
commercials, 2 promos, and the credits.  My old statistics probably
need to be updated, as it appears commercials are now taking nearly
20 minutes out of each hour, leaving only 40 for programming.  The
networks like to say that the shows have 45 minutes per hour, but I
think that may have changed recently, that's why I was checking.

By the way, the study that said we were generating half a million
Libraries of Congress worth of information yearly also said that:

Only 31 television hours out of every 123 are original, and thus
92 hours are reruns of something that has been seen before, either
on television or some other medium [including movies, I presume].

That's about 3/4 of everything on television has been shown before,
and only about 1/4 is actually something prepared for current showing.

And, from one of our readers:

Have you seen this report:
"MPAA, RIAA seek permanent antitrust exemption"
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/34191.html

Their latest solution to all those pesky antitrust suits:
buy a law which makes them exempt!

NPR'S PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BLUNDER


It seems that in a recent debate in which college students were
supposed to be asking the candidates questions, that some of the
questions were actually being fed to the students against their will.
It was basically a case of "Ask this question, or you don't get to
ask anything," at least in the case of the now infamous "Mac or PC"
question asked of the candidates.  Only one used a Mac, but that
was higher than the national average of some 1 out of 20.

So far it would appear that NPR is keeping the name of the producer
who did this a secret.
