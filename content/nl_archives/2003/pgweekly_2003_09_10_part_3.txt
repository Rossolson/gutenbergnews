----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE, if you are considering adding a new eBook to the Project
Gutenberg collection:

Please make sure that any books you want to work on are _not_ already
in the collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL  (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Also, please be sure
to check David Price's "In Progress" list at:
http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html
to ensure no one is currently working on your selection.  It would also
be helpful if you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books.
More information on this can be found in Parts 1 and/or 2 of the
newsletter.

REMINDER: GUTINDEX eBook numbers now have five digits.!

As we have recently posted our first eBook with a five digit eBook number
(#10701), we have made an adjustment to the GUTINDEXes to accomodate this
change. Basically, the alignment of eBook numbers less than 10,000 have
been moved one space to the right.  This change is also reflected in the
eBook listings below.

Note:  this listing best viewed with a fixed-width font, such as Courier New
       or similar.

A "?" at the beginning of the filename indicates that the eBook is
available in both 7-bit (plain text) & 8-bit (accented) versions.
