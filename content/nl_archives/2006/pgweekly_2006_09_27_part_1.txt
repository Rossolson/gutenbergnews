LAST CHANCE!

GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL! at the New York Musical Theater Festival
By Anthony King and Scott Brown. Directed by Dave Mowers.
Starring Chris Fitzgerald ("Wicked" / "Fully Committed"),
Jeremy Shamos ("The Rivals" / "Reckless") and Matt Castle
(John Doyle's "Company")

Johann Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1450. So Bud
Davenport and Doug Simon wrote a musical about him and they're
bringing it to Broadway. They don't have a cast, a budget, or a
producer . . . but they have a dream!

"A surefire hit ... it's so bang on the money that, were I a
speculative type, I'd almost be tempted to invest," The Daily Telegraph.

Gutenberg! The Musical! is Bud and Doug's backers' audition: a
tuneful, tasteless triumph, celebrating the monstrous success of
their idiocy. Since its sold-out January premiere in London,
performed by the authors, we've been polishing the script and
writing new songs. Now - with a fantastic creative team and hugely
talented new cast - we're bringing it home to New York.

"Utterly brilliant ... the funniest and cleverest spoof I've come
across ... Mel Brooks couldn't have done it better," Clive Davis.

Venue: Sage Theatre (711 7th Avenue, at Times Square).
6 performances only: Fri 22nd Sept (8pm), Mon 25th (4.30pm), 
Wed 27th (8pm), Thu 28th (8pm) and Sat 30th (1pm and 4.30pm). 
Running time: 90 minutes.

Tickets: $20.00.

To book: call 212-352-3101 or visit
http://www.nymf.org/index.php?module=ShowManager&func=display&sid=497


"Contains more wit and intelligence than three decades of megashows,"

Five Stars! The Times.

time or if you think I/we should keep doing them.

Thanks!

Some Suggestions We Received For The Newsletters


0.
Several people have merely suggested to other readers
that they start from both ends and read to the middle
and thus they will get the highlights first, and then
the regular features, requests, etc. that stay pretty
much the same from issue to issue.

I would agree with this suggestion, and would simply,
for my own edification, also read the "Flashback," as
I find it interesting to see Project Gutenberg eBooks
as they appeared in our catalog x years ago.


1.
Divide the Newsletter in Web page URLs so the readers 
could just jump to whatever portions they wanted.
[This would take some additional labor by someone who
was more familiar with writing web pages than I.]

You should already be able to jump to whichever parts
you want to read. . .simply use your search commands,
search for "*" plus the section header as outlined in
The Table of Contents.


2.
Redivide PT1 of the Weekly Newsletter into two parts.

[This would create a lot more work for whomever edits
the Newsletters, which probably wouldn't be so bad if
that were their only responsibility.  I work to point
of exhaustion nearly every single day, and I need for
things to become easier rather than harder.  Hence my
requests for anyone who would like to be editor:  the
format of the Newsletter would be their choice and we
could either turn over the statistics to them, or our
stats people could simply send in that portion, ahead
of the deadline by an hour or two.  We would continue
to encourage our readers to send in news items not in
the main regular media coverage.]


*

We are interested in increasing the "SF" available at Project Gutenberg of
Australia. To this end we are happy to receive donations of ebooks to add
to our collection.

SF, in this context can mean: Science, Speculative, Superhero, Swords,
Sorcery, Spies, Supernatural and Scary Fiction.

Of course, we are only able to accept works that are public domain in
Australia.

Generally speaking, this means that the author died in 1954 or earlier.

Please see our WANTED list at http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html for
authors and works of interest. If you have suggestions for authors or 
works to add to the list, please let us know.  Do check first that 
they are not already available at Project Gutenberg Australia or 
Project Gutenberg, please.  Contact details are provided on the WANTED page.

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

As always, ebooks by Australian authors and of general Australian interest
are always greatly appreciated.

               [Please note we have several counting methods,
               and they often differ by several book that we
               have to hunt down by hand to reconcile.]
               [Pleast note there is some duplication between
               these various collections.  Volunteers needed
               to take these duplications into account.]

                ~13% of the way from 20,000 to 30,000

               http://www.gutenberg.cc   [185,000+ files]

[Please note that the four collections totals are eBooks that originated
as created, edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and
its 50,000 volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with
100,000+ books contains entire eBook collections from 125+ eLibraries so
the production statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created
by the various teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share
the responsibility of maintaining.  The Consortia Center eBooks were and
are the responsibility of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy
to forward any suggestions for correction to those eLibraries, but those
eBooks must be edited by the donating parties, as per their requests.]

             18,298 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~266 eBooks per Month for ~68.75 Months

            3,218 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

            45 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
             9,111 total from Distributed Proofreaders
              Since October, 2000 [Details in PT1B]
              [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]
            [Note, PGDP mostly included in US eBooks]
         [Note, PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders
          whose total closely matches their grand total]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]


       We Are Averaging ~368 eBooks Per Month This Year!!!
              [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 85 eBooks Per Week In 2006
                        58 This Week
                        99 Last Week
                       278 This Month [Sep]


It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our first 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~12.5 years from Jan. 1994 to Jun. 2006 to go from 100 to 20,100

It took ~32 months, from 2003 to 2006 for our last 10,000 eBooks

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to 20,000

It took ~2.3 years from Jan. 2004 to Aug. 2006 from 11,000 to 21,000

Not counting the addition of The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center's
Receipt of ~100,000 eBooks from 125+ Other eLibraries Worldwide.

*

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

General Catalog of Old Books and Authors

http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm

which now indexes 24,000 books available free online, including all
PG(US) & PG(Aus)'s books, along with some basic date information
about them and their authors where you can find more.

Plus many books not available on line, a good place to search
for books by specific authors who you are interested in.

For information please contact Philip Harper
<webmaster AT kingkong.demon.co.uk>

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is an experimental online reader available.
Start from any bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar

made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES



Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars Worth or a Trillion eBooks Yet???


If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,546,790,688 that would be 21,366 x 65,467,907 = ~1.39 Trillion !!!

With 21,366 eBooks online as of September 27, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.72 from each book.
[1% world population x #eBooks] 65,467,869 x 21,365 x $.71 = ~$1 Trillion 
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]
[By the way, the US "popclock" is about to turn to 300 million people.]
[Just turning 299.9 million this week!]


A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.47 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 21,366 eBooks online as of September 27, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.47 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.58 when we had 17,211 eBooks a year ago.

[This is not counting the 100,000 eBooks at http://gutenberg.cc which are
counted and maintained separately by their donating electronic libraries]

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100 million people.

Next Decade's Target:  15% Of The world Population = 1 billion !!! people.


At 21,366 eBooks in 35 Years and 02.75 Months We Averaged
       606 Per Year
        51 Per Month
         1.66 Per Day

At 3218 eBooks Done In The 266 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
    12.1 Per Day
      85 per Week
     368 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 299M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 80% the way to 300M, so
it will probably be 2 more weeks to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

*

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


BRITISH LIBRARY SAYS COPYRIGHT LAW NEEDS UPDATING
The British Library has called for a wide-scale revision of existing
copyright law, which, it said, inadequately addresses digital content,
putting too much control into the hands of content producers and
owners. Lynne Brindley, chief executive of the British Library, took
aim at digital rights management (DRM) technology in particular, saying
that it allows content producers to prevent legitimate uses of content,
such as for academic purposes, for archival efforts, or for making
content available to people with disabilities. Calling the problem a
global issue, Brindley said that without "a serious updating of
copyright law to recognize the changing technological environment, the
law becomes an ass." The Open Rights Group supported the library's
call for revising copyright law, saying that the current situation
"allows publishers to write whatever license they like, which is what
is happening now." The British Library also said the question of
orphaned works should be addressed--works whose proper copyright owners
cannot be located easily or at all.

PUBLISHERS TAKE HEART FROM BELGIAN COURT RULING
Buoyed by a recent ruling from a court in Belgium, the World
Association of Newspapers (WAN) is leading the development of an
automated system for coordinating content permissions with search
engines. The Belgian court found that Google violates the rights of
content producers when it indexes news stories and reposts parts of
those stories on its own site. News organizations have long complained
that search engines profit from the efforts of news outlets, and the
court ruling, which Google is appealing, strengthens their position in
trying to restrict how search engines are allowed to use online
content. Search engines typically rely on applications that scour the
Web for content and incorporate it into search results without human
intervention. The Automated Content Access Protocol being developed by
the WAN will reportedly give news organizations the ability to include
parameters about how their content may be used inside online content.
The applications that search engines use to index content will be able
to interpret those parameters and treat the content accordingly. Gavin
O'Reilly, chairman of the WAN, said, "This system is intended to
remove completely any rights conflicts between publishers and search
engines."

YALE TO POST VIDEO OF COURSES ONLINE
Yale University announced plans to begin posting video of course
lectures online. Yale's effort is part of a larger movement in higher
education toward open courseware, led in large part by an initiative
started at MIT in 2001. For the OpenCourseWare project, MIT posts
course materials online, including syllabi, reading lists, and other
resources. Diana Kleiner, who is leading the effort at Yale, said the
project follows "MIT's footprints" but represents the next step.
Kleiner said that Yale officials believe the in-class experience to be
central to the educational experience. Under the program, all of the
lectures for a given course will be recorded and placed online.
Beginning with seven courses this year, the program is expected to grow
quickly to include many more in successive years. The university is
exploring ways to ensure that offering video of lectures online will
not encourage Yale students to skip class and simply watch the lectures
at their convenience. Also at issue are intellectual property
considerations, given that faculty are free to use some copyrighted
materials in lectures, but that those materials may not be used
similarly by the public.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

Besides all the references to the National Intelligence Estimate
that said the US is causing more terrorism via its trowback uses
of gunboat diplomacy in the Middle East, several officers in the
command positions in Iraq had the following comments this week.

The officers were, Major General John Batiste, Major General
Paul Eaton, and Colonel Paul Hammes.  Batiste was commander
of the 1st Infantry Division, and was also the senior military
aide to Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and blames Congress
for not asking "the tough questions."  He also mentioned threats
by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to fire anyone who said
he needed a postwar strategy.

In comments earlier this spring, General Batiste added, "the current
administration repeatedly ignored sound military advice and counsel
with respect to the war plans. I think the principles of war are
fundamental, and we violate those at our own peril."

Around the same time Commanding General Anthony Zinni, of the
Central Command in Iraq had the following additional comments:

"I think we are paying the price for lack of credible planning, or 
the lack of a plan. We are throwing away 10 years of planning, in
effect, for underestimating the situation we were going to get into
and for not adhering to the advice that was being given to us by others.''

Major General Eaton said referred to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld
as "incompetent, stragically, operationally, and tactically," and
added "Mr. Rumsfeld and his immediate team must be replaced or we
will see two more years of extraordinaily bad decision making."

Eaton was in command of U.S. efforts to train the Iraq military
until the last election.

Earlier this year he wrote the following to the New York Times:

"Rumsfeld has put the Pentagon at the mercy of his ego, his Cold
Warrior's view of the world and his unrealistic confidence in
technology to replace manpower. As a result, the US Army finds itself
severely undermanned. . .cut to 10 active divisions but asked by the
administration to support a foreign policy that requires at least 12
or 14," [active divisions].



DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

The various declassifying of minimal pages of the National
Intelligence Estimate that only support the administration,
but leave out the entire portion that said the U.S. caused
more problems than it solved by invading Iraq.


*QUOTES OF THE WEEK

16 days afterwards, still no real apology from the Pope.


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Just as the rich keep getting richer,
and the poor keep getting poorer,
the distance between the various
portions of humanity will increase,
and the reason won't matter. . .
any reason will do. . .the reasons
for wars are usually fabrications.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

47% of female students said they would not raise their hands
in class even if they knew the answer for fear of harassment
for being smart.

Source:  NPR, Sunday Morning

*

By the way, for those interested, the official U.S. population
[i.e. if you had invested in ConEd and the S&P in 1997,
and had made $1,000 on your S&P, your profits from that
ConEd stock would be $15,000]

Yet the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) voted 5-0 to 
allow the new system.
estimates just passed 299 million, though many say estimations
of this nature leave out as much as 5% of the population, with
the obvious exclusion of the 11-12 million immigrant workers
now being mentioned so much in the news.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
is obviously no longer 6% of the world.  In fact, rounding to the
nearest percent, the US will soon fall from 5% to 4%.]

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
