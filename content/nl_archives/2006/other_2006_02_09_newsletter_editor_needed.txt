Next Wednesday is the last Wednesday before I leave to give a
presentation in Alaska followed by a month's working vacation.

I can usually help quite a bit while I am on the road, but it
is harder when I don't have the usual tools at hand, and I am
unable to do all kinds of cutting and pasting as usual.

A few alternatives:

We could only do the PT2 automated Newsletter.

We could do a very short weekly Newsletter for that month.

We could try to do something as long as usual, with help.

Any suggestions or volunteers?

Thanks!!!
