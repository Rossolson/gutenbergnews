The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, November 15, 2006 PT1
******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971*******

This is possibly my last Newsletter for a while, as I may, all thing
permitting, be on a speaking tour until near the end of the year.

I did a couple presentations over the weekend, but have not left
on the extended tour yet.

Still here, the presentations for this week were not needed, as the
matters were completed at a distance.

We are experimenting with a new format we will try to send shortly.

/


For now I am leaving PT1a and PT1b combined.

Please also let me know if you think these Newsletters are a waste of 
time or if you think I/we should keep doing them.

Thanks!

Michael

Some Suggestions We Received For The Newsletters


0.
Several people have merely suggested to other readers
that they start from both ends and read to the middle
and thus they will get the highlights first, and then
the regular features, requests, etc. that stay pretty
much the same from issue to issue.

I would agree with this suggestion, and would simply,
for my own edification, also read the "Flashback," as
I find it interesting to see Project Gutenberg eBooks
as they appeared in our catalog x years ago.


1.
Divide the Newsletter in Web page URLs so the readers 
could just jump to whatever portions they wanted.
[This would take some additional labor by someone who
was more familiar with writing web pages than I.]

You should already be able to jump to whichever parts
you want to read. . .simply use your search commands,
search for "*" plus the section header as outlined in
The Table of Contents.


2.
Redivide PT1 of the Weekly Newsletter into two parts.

[This would create a lot more work for whomever edits
the Newsletters, which probably wouldn't be so bad if
that were their only responsibility.  I work to point
of exhaustion nearly every single day, and I need for
things to become easier rather than harder.  Hence my
requests for anyone who would like to be editor:  the
format of the Newsletter would be their choice and we
could either turn over the statistics to them, or our
stats people could simply send in that portion, ahead
of the deadline by an hour or two.  We would continue
to encourage our readers to send in news items not in
the main regular media coverage.]


*

We are interested in increasing the "SF" available at Project Gutenberg of
Australia. To this end we are happy to receive donations of ebooks to add
to our collection.

SF, in this context can mean: Science, Speculative, Superhero, Swords,
Sorcery, Spies, Supernatural and Scary Fiction.

Of course, we are only able to accept works that are public domain in
Australia.

Generally speaking, this means that the author died in 1954 or earlier.

Please see our WANTED list at http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html for
authors and works of interest. If you have suggestions for authors or 
works to add to the list, please let us know.  Do check first that 
they are not already available at Project Gutenberg Australia or 
Project Gutenberg, please.  Contact details are provided on the WANTED page.

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

As always, ebooks by Australian authors and of general Australian interest
are always greatly appreciated.

               [Please note we have several counting methods,
               and they often differ by several book that we
               have to hunt down by hand to reconcile.]
               [Pleast note there is some duplication between
               these various collections.  Volunteers needed
               to take these duplications into account.]

                ~19% of the way from 20,000 to 30,000

               100,000+ eBooks at the PG Consortia Center
               http://www.gutenberg.cc   [185,000+ files]

[Please note that the four collections totals are eBooks that originated
as created, edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and
its 50,000 volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with
100,000+ books contains entire eBook collections from 125+ eLibraries so
the production statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created
by the various teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share
the responsibility of maintaining.  The Consortia Center eBooks were and
are the responsibility of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy
to forward any suggestions for correction to those eLibraries, but those
eBooks must be edited by the donating parties, as per their requests.]

             18,883 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~268 eBooks per Month for ~70.00 Months

            3,753 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

            48 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
             9,368 total from Distributed Proofreaders
               Since October, 2000 [Details in PT1B]
               [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]
            [Note, PGDP mostly included in US eBooks]
         [Note, PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders
          whose total closely matches their grand total]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]


       We Are Averaging ~366 eBooks Per Month This Year!!!
              [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]
    Enough Each Month To Read A Book A Day For A Whole Year!!!

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 83 eBooks Per Week In 2006
                       102 This Week
                        95 Last Week
                       197 This Month [Nov]


It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our first 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~12.5 years from Jan. 1994 to Jun. 2006 to go from 100 to 20,100

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to 20,000


Not counting the addition of The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center's
Receipt of ~100,000 eBooks from 125+ Other eLibraries Worldwide which
started in March, 2003.

*

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

Still up in the air, sorry.

We are experimenting with a new format we will try to send shortly.



***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements


General Catalog of Old Books and Authors

http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm

which now indexes 24,000 books available free online, including all
PG(US) & PG(Aus)'s books, along with some basic date information
about them and their authors where you can find more.

Plus many books not available on line, a good place to search
for books by specific authors who you are interested in.

For information please contact Philip Harper
<webmaster AT kingkong.demon.co.uk>

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is an experimental online reader available.
Start from any bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject

and

The PG bittorrent tracker is up and running.
Aaron Cannon has placed the CD and DVD there if anyone wants to test.
You can access it by visiting

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES



Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion eBooks/Trillion Dollars Yet???

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,557,127,950 that would be 21,901 x 65,571,271 = ~1.44 Trillion !!!

With 21,901 eBooks online as of November 15, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.70 from each book from
Project Gutenberg to have yielded $1 trillion.

[1% world population x #eBooks] R65,571,271x 21,901 x $.70 = ~$1 Trillion

[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]



A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.46 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 21,901 eBooks online as of November 15, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.46 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.57 when we had 17,527 eBooks a year ago.

[This is not counting the 100,000 eBooks at http://gutenberg.cc which are
counted and maintained separately by their donating electronic libraries]

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100 million people.

Next Decade's Target:  15% Of The world Population = 1 billion !!! people.


At 21,901 eBooks in 35 Years and 04.25 Months We Averaged
       619 Per Year
        52 Per Month
         1.70 Per Day

At 3753 eBooks Done In The 315 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
      12 Per Day
      83 per Week
     366 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 299M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 80% the way to 300M, so
it will probably be 2 more weeks to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

*

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]



2006 NSSE LOOKS AT DISTANCE EDUCATION
Results from the 2006 National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE)
indicate high levels of student engagement in online and distance
programs. The survey, which began in 1999, this year added questions
designed to shed light on the habits of nontraditional students,
including adult and distance learners. Among its results, the NSSE
found that these students were more likely to be prepared for class, to
ask questions, and to rewrite papers before submitting them. Students
in distance-education programs reported being more academically
challenged than on-campus students, also noting that they saw larger
developmental gains. Distance students also reported comparable levels
of interaction with faculty as did on-campus students. George Kuh,
director of the NSSE and a professor of higher education at Indiana
University at Bloomington, said, "This is a group that spends more time
on academic matters, is highly focused, serious, more motivated perhaps
than the typical-aged student." Kuh said it was "gratifying" to learn
that online students are at least as engaged as traditional students.

SLOAN REPORT FINDS GROWTH IN ONLINE STUDENTS
The latest survey of online learning by the Sloan Consortium reported
that about 3.2 million students took at least one online course from a
degree-granting institution in fall 2005, double the number who did in
2002. The report, issued jointly by the Sloan Consortium and the
College Board, defines an online course as one in which at least 80
percent of the content is delivered over the Internet. The rate of
growth of online students slowed from 2003 to 2004 despite a continuing
upward trend. In contrast, only one in four academic leaders said their
faculty have embraced online education, a number that has persisted
through four surveys.

JAVA GOES OPEN SOURCE
Sun Microsystems announced plans to release Java as open source
software in an effort to draw more developers to the language. Java,
which is more than 10 years old, is widely used in cell phones and
other handheld devices and in servers and personal computers. As an
open source application, Java will be accessible to developers to make
changes and share those changes with others. Rich Green, executive vice
president of software at Sun, said the decision to release Java as open
source will result in "more richness of offerings, more capability,
more applications that consumers will get to use." Java, he said, "will
become a place for innovation." Analysts agreed that a healthy
community of Java developers would be beneficial to Sun. Michael Cote,
an analyst with RedMonk, noted, "Sun profits from the Java ecosystem
thriving." Green said that all of the Java source code should be
available by March 2007.

MICROSOFT PAYS ROYALTIES TO UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP

[But only half of that money goes to the actual artists,
the other half gets eaten up by these UMG "agents."]
[And you thought royalties went to real people.]

portable media player to the Universal Music Group, a unit of Vivendi.
Under the deal, Universal will receive a percentage of both download
revenue and digital player sales. In exhange, Universal Music will
license its musical recordings for Microsoft's digital music service.
Universal said it will pay half of what it receives in royalties to its
artists.

LOWER PHONE PRICES BOOST NUMBER OF MOBILE USERS

[People in these countries pay only 2c per minute]
[Internet prices are comparably low]

Market researcher iSuppli claims that the number of mobile phone
subscribers worlwide will hit 2.6 billion this year and 4 billion by
2010, largely because of ultra-low-cost handsets. The growth in users
is driven by new subscribers in developing nations like India and
China, along with Africa and the Middle East, said Dale Ford, vice
president of market intelligence for iSuppli.

BIG U.S. WEB SITES SEE MOSTLY INTERNATIONAL VISITORS
More than three-fourths of Web visitors to large U.S. Web sites such as
Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo come from overseas. The three companies
are among 14 of the top 25 U.S. Web sites that draw more foreign
traffic than U.S.-based traffic, according to market research company
ComScore Networks. In 10 years, the U.S. share of the world's online
population reportedly has fallen from 64 percent to less than 25
percent, although U.S. Web surfers evidently visit more pages each.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE INTRODUCES IPOD PROGRAM
The Community College of Southern Nevada (CCSN) is launching an iPod
program to try to find out if the devices can assist in student
learning. Students in the five or six classes in the pilot program will
be loaned iPods by the institution. Faculty in those courses will
augment the syllabus with podcasts of lectures and other lessons, as
well as additional resources, such as music or other recorded material
that helps explain a concept. After the semester is over, faculty
involved in the program will be surveyed on whether the devices
improved student outcomes; if so, the program is likely to be expanded
in later terms. Lester Tanaka, an instructor at CCSN, said that
students today are immersed in technology and expect college content to
take advantage of it. Faculty can continue to lecture, he said, which
will simply put students to sleep, or they can "step up to the plate
and deliver the material in a way that is more palatable." Richard
Carpenter, president of CCSN, noted that "the students who have
appropriate self-discipline will love it. Those who don't have that
may not do as well."

ORGANIZATION IDENTIFIES WORST INTERNET CENSORS
Paris-based Reporters Without Borders has issued a list of 13 countries
it says are the most egregious censors of Internet speech. On the list
are Belarus, China, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Saudi
Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.
According to the organization, these countries stifle online speech
they deem subversive or threatening to the government, including
sentencing to prison individuals accused of posting such material.
Reporters Without Borders also criticized Yahoo and other Internet
companies for cooperating with the governments of these countries in
identifying individuals targeted for prosecution. In the case of Jiang
Lijun, a Chinese man sentenced to four years in prison for
pro-democracy remarks, Reporters Without Borders said Yahoo's
assistance was key to Chinese authorities' ability to identify him.
"It's one thing to turn a blind eye to censorship," said Lucie
Morillon, a spokesperson with the organization. "It's another thing to
collaborate."

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

Rumsfeld War Crimes Charges Files In Germany


Ousted U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is being charged
in German courts via a complaint filed by the international Center
for Constitutional Rights.  Also charged are Alberto Gonzales, who
was previously White House Counsel and is now U.S. Attorney General,
along with former CIA Director George Tenet.

The complaint filed requests the opening of an official look into
the various unofficial charges of torture at Abu Ghraib prison in
Iraq, the Guantanamo prison in Cuba, and perhaps the various kinds
of "Black Prisons" and "rendition" of prisoners to locations where
they could be tortured in peace and quiet without oversight by the
U.S. courts or Congress.

The suit names one dozen victims who claim they were tortured with
electricity, beatings, sexual abuse, hypothermia [severe cold] and
long periods without food, water, or sleep, among other events.

Several countries have such laws that allow the prosecution of war
crimes no matter where they were committed.  Previously Mr. Rumsfeld
held "diplomatic immunity" which prevented such charges being filed,
but he recent ouster only one day after the U.S. elections could be
just the ticket these countries need to put him on wanted posters.

The 220 page complaint names 14 defendants, including generals and
lawyers who supported the torture in writing, along with the above,
who also apparently signed incriminating memos that have surfaced.

Apparently it was not only diplomatic immunity, but also some NATO
meeting in Germany, that prevented these charges previously, when
Rumsfeld was encouraged to participate in the NATO meeting by not
allowing the charges to become official.

DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK


Will The Real 007 Please Step Forward

Great Britain's secret agents are using the new James Bond movie
as a recruiting tool going public for the first time in a manner
previously reserved for surreptitiously whispered conversations,
nearly always taking place with students at Oxford or Cambridge.
[The question thus arises whether the new recruits would fall in
a sort of "glass ceiling" situation in which they could not have
any promotions past a certain level due to the infamous caste of
class systems in The United Kingdom.]

[Of course, MI6 denies any operations not in accordance with laws
of the UK, not to mention being in a recruiting crisis.]

Source:  BBC, MI6 [Military Intelligence, Branch 6]



*QUOTES OF THE WEEK

"Bipartisan" "Iraq Study Group" "Non-Starter" new DC buzzwords.


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

The Democrats will not say or do much. . . .

Perhaps oust John Bolton, who was never really UN Ambassador,
perhaps finally get a new national minimum wage, though most
states have taken this into their own hands, not waiting for
Washington's interminable quid pro quoisms from both parties.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Many states have not only already passed their own standards
for minimum wages, but many of these are higher than those
being proposed at the national level.  "The Governator" had
to embrace one of these to get re-elected in California.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
is obviously no longer 6% of the world.  In fact, rounding to the
nearest percent, the US will soon fall from 5% to 4%.]

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
