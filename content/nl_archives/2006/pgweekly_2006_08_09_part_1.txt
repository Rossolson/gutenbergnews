We are interested in increasing the "SF" available at Project Gutenberg of
Australia. To this end we are happy to receive donations of ebooks to add
to our collection.

SF, in this context can mean: Science, Speculative, Superhero, Swords,
Sorcery, Spies, Supernatural and Scary Fiction.

Of course, we are only able to accept works that are public domain in
Australia.

Generally speaking, this means that the author died in 1954 or earlier.

Please see our WANTED list at http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html for
authors and works of interest. If you have suggestions for authors or 
works to add to the list, please let us know.  Do check first that 
they are not already available at Project Gutenberg Australia or 
Project Gutenberg, please.  Contact details are provided on the WANTED page.

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

As always, ebooks by Australian authors and of general Australian interest
are always greatly appreciated.


Editor's comments appear in [brackets].

        20,696 [I added a few we missed last week....]
               [via our automated program, versus by hand]
               [Please note we have several counting methods,
               and they often differ by several book that we
               have to hunt down by hand to reconcile.]
               [Pleast note there is some duplication between
               these various collections.  voluntgeers needed
               to take these duplications into account.]

                 ~7% of the way from 20,000 to 30,000

               75,000+ eBooks at the PG Consortia Center
               http://www.gutenberg.cc

[Please note that the four collections totals are eBooks that originated
as created, edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and
its 50,000 volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with
75,000+ eBooks contains entire eBook collections from other sources, all
the production statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created
by the various teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share
the responsibility of maintaining.  The Consortia Center eBooks were and
are the responsibility of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy
to forward any suggestions for correction to those eLibraries, but those
eBooks must be editing by the donating parties, as per their requests.]

      ***582 eBooks Averaged Per Year Since July 4, 1971***

             17,628 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~263 eBooks per Month for ~67.00 Months

            2,548 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

            34 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
             8,872 total from Distributed Proofreaders
              Since October, 2000 [Details in PT1B]
              [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]
            [Note, PGDP mostly included in US eBooks]
         [Note, PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders
          whose total closely matches their grand total]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]

        We Are Averaging ~363 eBooks Per Month This Year!!!
                [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 82 eBooks Per Week In 2006
                           77 This Week
                           77 This Month [Aug]


It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our 1st 10,000 eBooks

It took ~12.5 years from Jan. 1994 to Jun. 2006 to go from 100 to 20,100

It took ~32 months, from 2003 to 2006 for our last 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to 20,000

Not counting the addition of The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center,
through whom over 100 other eLibraries have donated their collections.
*

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements


General Catalog of Old Books and Authors

http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm

which now indexes 24,000 books available free online, including all
PG(US) & PG(Aus)'s books, along with some basic date information
about them and their authors where you can find more.

Plus many books not available on line, a good place to search
for books by specific authors who you are interested in.

For information please contact Philip Harper
<webmaster AT kingkong.demon.co.uk>

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is an experimental online reader available.
Start from any bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject

and

So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

We have regular need for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby <gbnewby AT pglaf.org> ,

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~34,286 Unique eBooks

*

The new overall collection size, which has reduced the
need to account for duplications and eBooks with files
for each chapter, etc.
                                  75,000+ Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 25,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 6,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 298M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 1/6 the way to 299M, so
it will probably be 10 more weeks to 299M and 22 more to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


UC TO JOIN GOOGLE'S BOOK SCANNING PROJECT?
The University of California is reportedly in talks with Google to join
its controversial book-scanning project. The university is already
participating in the Open Content Alliance (OCA), which is also working
to digitize vast numbers of books but with a different approach. Rather
than scanning all books, copyrighted or not, unless copyright holders
request that a book be left out of the program, the OCA has taken the
approach of only scanning copyrighted books whose owners have given
explicit permission. The university and Google did not disclose details
of the negotiations, but questions arose about how the institution's
participation in the two projects might be reconciled. Brewster Kahle,
director of the Internet Archive, which was a founder of the OCA,
wondered if perhaps Google would move its project to a more open model,
closer to that of the OCA, because, as he said, "there is no point in
scanning these books twice." Daniel Greenstein, director of the
University of California system's California Digital Library, said the
issue is fundamentally not about specific companies or organizations
but about the university's mission to support public education and
explore new roles for libraries in the digital age.

CHILD ONLINE IDENTITY CARD DEBUTS
An online identity service for children has debuted in the United
Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia. Conceived by U.K.
businessman Alex Hewitt, the NetIDMe system requires parents to apply
for ID cards for their kids and to supply a credit card as
verification. Another person who knows the child must countersign the
application. Once an ID is established, users can communicate with
others online with the assurance that users who say they are children
are not in fact adults who prey on kids. The service, which costs 10
pounds per year, is only effective if both communicating parties
participate. Jim Gamble, chief executive of the Child Exploitation and
Online Protection Centre, said that this effort, like any other that
works to verify the age and identity of Internet users, will help
prevent children from becoming victims of online predators. Detective
Chief Superintendent Tom Porter of the Scottish Crime and Drug
Enforcement Agency noted that Web users should nonetheless be cautious.
"We would advise all parents and young people to...ensure no personally
identifiable information is shared with online strangers."

CHINA CLOSES LIBERAL WEB SITE
Government officials in China have taken another step in limiting what
Internet users in the country can access, causing an uproar among
intellectuals and others critical of the Communist Party. During the
past week, access inside China to the Century China Web site has been
cut off, prompting a petition that accuses the government of trying to
control public opinion. More than 100 outspoken individuals--both
inside the country and abroad--have signed the petition, which was sent
by e-mail to the media. The petition states, in part, "The shutdown of
Century China is just another instance of the Chinese government
suppressing the freedom of its people." It also describes the Century
China Web site as "the one spiritual home we had in the cyberworld."

STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


Concerning the recent miniumum wage and estate tax legislation.

There are ~6.25 million minimum wage workers in the United States.

On the average each ones works under 2,000 hours per year.

250 days times 8 hours = 2,000 hours.

50 weeks times 40 hours = 2,000 hours.

Obivously there are more days off than just weekends, so this is
a very conservative estimate for these purposes.

At $2 per year increase in pay, this about about $4,000 each.

6.25 million times $4,000 = 25 billion dollars.

After a 3 year phase in period.

26.25 billion if you count in the extra dime, which will be
eaten by inflation before the first year of phasing in.

Now let's count the other side of the coin.

If the estate tax repeal only effects the richest 1% of the US,
that is about 3 million people.  Given that people are dying on
the average at the rate of well over 1% per year [the average
life-expectancy would have to be 100, for it to be 1%, and it
is more like 75, for those dying today, though we might have to
take into account better health care for the wealthy, since the
US is the only developed country without a national health care.

So, to be VERY conservative in our estimation, we will figure on
a 1% per year death rate among the 1% wealtiest Americans.

That's 30,000 people per year who stand to get estate tax repeal.

At just 1 million dollars each that is 30 billion dollars.

. . .

When you look at your own estate, or that of your parents, might
be that you will realize that the estates of the top 1% are many
times larger than yours and yours is still a reasonable fraction
of a million dollars.

Now perhaps you can visualize why the legistlation was defeated.

1.  The estate tax releal would kick in right away.

2.  The minimum wage raise was already eaten away by inflation.

3.  The minimum wage figures are in pre-tax dollars, workers do
not get nearly that much in their pockets.

4.  The estate tax is in post-tax dollars, they keep it all.

5.  The great fortunes of the Rockefellers, etc. were made with
income tax rates as high as 93%, and passed on with estate tax.

>From "Media Matters"

The states with the greastest discrepancies between exit polls
and votes reported were Republican states.

[Some say this is just because Republicans are more private.]



*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA



*DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

[Sorry, this was supposed to go in last week, still learning system.]

The House passed a bill finally raising the minimum wage from $5.15
over a 3 year period to ~$7.25, but only for the quid pro quo of an
extra repeal of the estate tax on the very wealthy.

In reality, the poor are not even really getting a raise, they are
merely getting an inflation offset, while the rich are getting the
millions they now have passed on from generation to generation for
the formation of the same kind of "Landed Gentry" aristocracy that
ruined Europe and caused the American and French revolutions.

Let's see:  "You give us billions in tax cuts for the very wealthy
and we will give you ~$2 an hour in inflated money that gives your
salary less buying power than was available 50 years ago."

"That's what common folk call:

"Robbing Peter to pay Paul."

Robin Hood would call it:

"Robbing the poor to give to the rich."


MORE DOUBLESPEAK

The Senate refused to repeal 100% of the estate tax that had been
vilified as "The Death Tax," by embattled White House guru Karl Rove,
but in the end it will cost the real taxpayers just as much, as the
deal is being engineered by repealing what may be all timber company
taxes to win over Senate votes from timber rich Washington State.

All in all The Estate Tax is being repealed for all but the richest
1% or less in the country, and it should be mentioned that that 1%
owns half of everything that can be owned in the United States.

Source:  The Washington Post

[I wonder how rest of the country would react to all this if that 1%
actually lived on their blocks, and owned half the land, half the cars,
half the stocks, bonds, cash, boats, etc. while the next 2% owned half
of what was left, and the next 4% owned half of that, etc. . .leaving
only a few percent to be earned by 90% of the block's residents???]


*QUOTES OF THE WEEK



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

It will eventually be determined that there has been an overall
pattern of divulging the personal information of U.S. citizens.

By the way, I think evidence of this was in the media last week.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


*

By the way, for those interested, the official U.S. population
estimates just passed 298 million, though many say estimations
of this nature leave out as much as 5% of the population, with
the obvious exclusion of the 11-12 million immigrant workers
now being mentioned so much in the news.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
