We are interested in increasing the "SF" available at Project Gutenberg of
Australia. To this end we are happy to receive donations of ebooks to add
to our collection.

SF, in this context can mean: Science, Speculative, Superhero, Swords,
Sorcery, Spies, Supernatural and Scary Fiction.

Of course, we are only able to accept works that are public domain in
Australia.

Generally speaking, this means that the author died in 1954 or earlier.

Please see our WANTED list at http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html for
authors and works of interest. If you have suggestions for authors or 
works to add to the list, please let us know.  Do check first that 
they are not already available at Project Gutenberg Australia or 
Project Gutenberg, please.  Contact details are provided on the WANTED page.

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

As always, ebooks by Australian authors and of general Australian interest
are always greatly appreciated.


Editor's comments appear in [brackets].

               [Please note we have several counting methods,
               and they often differ by several book that we
               have to hunt down by hand to reconcile.]
               [Pleast note there is some duplication between
               these various collections.  Volunteers needed
               to take these duplications into account.]

                 ~9% of the way from 20,000 to 30,000

               75,000+ eBooks at the PG Consortia Center
               http://www.gutenberg.cc

[Please note that the four collections totals are eBooks that originated
as created, edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and
its 50,000 volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with
75,000+ eBooks contains entire eBook collections from other sources, all
the production statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created
by the various teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share
the responsibility of maintaining.  The Consortia Center eBooks were and
are the responsibility of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy
to forward any suggestions for correction to those eLibraries, but those
eBooks must be edited by the donating parties, as per their requests.]

             17,822 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~264 eBooks per Month for ~67.50 Months

            2,742 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

            35 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
             8,945 totAl from Distributed Proofreaders
              Since October, 2000 [Details in PT1B]
              [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]
            [Note, PGDP mostly included in US eBooks]
         [Note, PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders
          whose total closely matches their grand total]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]

        We Are Averaging ~366 eBooks Per Month This Year!!!
                [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 83 eBooks Per Week In 2006
                       100 This Week
                        97 Last Week
                       271 This Month [Aug]


It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our 1st 10,000 eBooks

It took ~12.5 years from Jan. 1994 to Jun. 2006 to go from 100 to 20,100

It took ~32 months, from 2003 to 2006 for our last 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to 20,000

Not counting the addition of The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center

*

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements


General Catalog of Old Books and Authors

http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm

which now indexes 24,000 books available free online, including all
PG(US) & PG(Aus)'s books, along with some basic date information
about them and their authors where you can find more.

Plus many books not available on line, a good place to search
for books by specific authors who you are interested in.

For information please contact Philip Harper
<webmaster AT kingkong.demon.co.uk>

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is an experimental online reader available.
Start from any bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~34,286 Unique eBooks

*

The new overall collection size, which has reduced the
need to account for duplications and eBooks with files
for each chapter, etc.
                                  75,000+ Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 25,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 6,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet?

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,536,460,759 that would be 20,890 x 65,364,608 = ~1.37 Trillion !!!

With 20,890 eBooks online as of August 23, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.73 from each book.
[1% world population x #eBooks] 65,364,608 x 20,890 x $.73 = ~$1 Trillion
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]
[By the way, the US "popclock" is about to turn to 300 million people.]
[Just turned 299.5 million this week!]



A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.48 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 20,8790 eBooks online as of August 23, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.48 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.59 when we had 17,020 eBooks a year ago.

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100,000,000 people.

Next Decade's Target:  15% Of The world Population = 1,000,000,000 people.

At 20,890 eBooks in 35 Years and 01.50 Months We Averaged
       595 Per Year
        50 Per Month
         1.63 Per Day

At 2742 eBooks Done In The 231 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
    11.9 Per Day
      83 per Week
     366 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 298M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 1/6 the way to 299M, so
it will probably be 10 more weeks to 299M and 22 more to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

*

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

PENN STATE ADOPTS TEXT MESSAGES TO STUDENTS

Pennsylvania State university will launch a text-messaging wireless
service called PSUTXT today as an expansion of Penn State Live, a news
service with 360,000 subscribers. The university plans to use the
service to send text messages of news alerts to mobile devices.
Registered users can sign up for short message service (SMS) text
messages on campus emergencies, sports, and concert information. Topics
will expand as users indicate an interest in other types of
information. PSUTXT targets Penn State students, faculty, and staff,
although anyone may subscribe.

EU ORDERS DEUTSCHE TELEKOM TO SHARE NETWORK

The European Commission (EC) supported German regulators who ordered
Deutsche Telekom AG to open its high-speed Internet networks to
competitors. As a result of the order, the company must permit
competitors to buy access on its broadband network to offer their own
services to end users. German regulators will have advance approval of
the price charged. Past refusals to grant access forced the company's
business rivals to build their own networks, effectively preventing
them from operating outside cities and causing higher Internet prices
in rural areas, according to the EC.

APPEALS COURT SUPPORTS FCC RULE ON HIGH-SPEED LINES

A federal appeals court has turned down an appeal of a decision by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that exempted certain kinds of
telecom lines from regulations that require companies to lease access
to rivals. A law passed in 1996 forces telecom companies to unbundle
local phone networks and allow competitors to buy access to them. The
FCC ruled that this requirement should not apply to certain lines,
including new fiber-optic lines to residential customers, because
requiring such sharing would discourage companies from making
investments in this kind of infrastructure. EarthLink challenged the
ruling, but the appeals court sided with the FCC, giving a boost to
companies including AT&T and Verizon.

MICROSOFT REPAIRS SECURITY PATCH

Microsoft announced that it has fixed a bug in the MS06-040 Windows
Server services update, a critical security patch. The bug affected
programs that use large amounts of memory on some versions of Windows.
Although the bug did not affect most Windows systems, it did cause
problems in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and the 64-bit version of
Windows XP Professional Edition. The company's fix for the problem is
available online.

MS WINDOWS FLAWS AGAIN TARGETED BY HACKERS
Security companies have identified a new worm circulating that seeks to
take advantage of a flaw in the Windows operating system and allows
hackers to use infected computers to send spam. Earlier this month,
Microsoft issued a patch for 23 vulnerabilities, including the one that
the new worm uses. Because the patch has only been available for a
week, however, experts said many computers are likely still at risk for
the malicious code. Infected computers can be used as spam
proxies--computers that send millions of junk e-mails on behalf of
spammers. Many spammers are resorting to this sort of approach because
ISPs are increasingly unwilling to host such e-mail campaigns.

MS SECURITY UPDATE NEEDS AN UPDATE
Microsoft acknowledged that a patch issued earlier this month for
significant flaws in its operating system has led to new problems for
some users. Computers that installed the August patch on Windows 2000
or Windows XP machines with Service Pack 1 and Internet Explorer 6 are
experiencing browser crashes when they visit Web sites that use HTTP
1.1 and compression. Fred Dunn, a systems administrator at the
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, said that at
his institution, computers with the patch are crashing when users
access pages in PeopleSoft applications. The workaround, he said, is to
disable the compression in the PeopleSoft applications, which slows
performance considerably. Microsoft said that on August 22 it would
issue a new patch to replace the patch that is causing these problems.

ENCRYPTION FOR MOBILE PHONES

A British company said it has developed technology that encrypts
transmissions on cell phones, allowing users to make calls with
confidence that their conversations cannot be intercepted. One Day
Mobile reportedly developed the technology with German company Safe.com
and with the military. With the software, which must be installed on
cell phones, users can decide which of their calls will be encrypted.
Encrypted calls are sent over the data network, however, rather than
the voice network, which can result in decreased performance. Voice
networks are built to ensure smooth and fast transmission, but using
the data network to transfer voice traffic can be slower and bumpier
and can impose delays.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


*QUOTATION OF THE WEEK

"We have united our enemies,
and divided our friends."

Multiple sources



/

"Every collectivist revolution rides in on a Trojan horse of 
'emergency'. It was the tactic of Lenin, Hitler, and Mussolini. 
In the collectivist sweep over a dozen minor countries of Europe, 
and 'emergency' became the justification of the subsequent steps. 
This technique of creating emergency is the greatest achievement 
that demagoguery attains." ---Herbert Hoover



*STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


1/8 of the official population of the United States
is composed of immigrants.

/

President White of the University of Illinois says that colleges
are dropping the ball by graduating only 28% of of Americans for
whom 85% have already managed a high school diploma.  He said at
the opening of the Fall semester than government should spend an
increasing amount on education to fill this gap.

Let's look into these statistics a little more:

28% / 85%  =  ~1/3 of all high school students graduate college.

When I was a kid the percentage of college degress was only some
half as much of the total population. . .~14%, so I would say it
is obvious that college plays an ever incrasing role in lives of
Americans. . .twice as much as it used to, in fact.

However, official US Adult Literacy statistics show that about a
half of all adult Americans would be challenged in reading this,
much less by reading all the materials for a college degree.


The National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) released by the 
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), found little
change between 1992 and 2003 in adults' ability to read and 
understand sentences and paragraphs or to understand documents 
such as job applications.

December 15, 2005 Contacts: Mike Bowler, (202) 219-1662
or David Thomas, (202)401-1576

If you read far enough in their documents, and add up the totals
they refuse to give you outright, you will see that just about a
half of US Adults could be expected to read such materials while
the other half would be challenged to do so.

As with so many other negative government statistics, these were
presented in a manner that diguised their actual meaning.

However, even more negative is the fact that 85% get high school
diplomas, while only about half of them can read at satisfactory
high school graduation levels.

[I suppose this could also qualify for the doublespeak section.]


*DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

*QUOTES OF THE WEEK



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

There will be another war between Israel and Lebanon,
simply because no one will stop them.

The Iraq War will continue until officials finally
manage to admit it is another viet Nam.

Or, even more unlikely, until there is a real plan.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

[I think the inflation/growth statistics in the news
were plenty odd enough.  However, I should add that
manufacturing costs rose sharply around the world,
up 1.1% in the UK in July alone, though those have
not yet reached the consumer markets.]

*

By the way, for those interested, the official U.S. population
estimates just passed 298 million, though many say estimations
of this nature leave out as much as 5% of the population, with
the obvious exclusion of the 11-12 million immigrant workers
now being mentioned so much in the news.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
is obviously no longer 6% of the world.  In fact, rounding to the
nearest percent, the US will soon fall from 5% to 4%.]

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
