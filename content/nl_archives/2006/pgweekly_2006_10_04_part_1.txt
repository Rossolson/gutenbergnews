Some Suggestions We Received For The Newsletters


0.
Several people have merely suggested to other readers
that they start from both ends and read to the middle
and thus they will get the highlights first, and then
the regular features, requests, etc. that stay pretty
much the same from issue to issue.

I would agree with this suggestion, and would simply,
for my own edification, also read the "Flashback," as
I find it interesting to see Project Gutenberg eBooks
as they appeared in our catalog x years ago.


1.
Divide the Newsletter in Web page URLs so the readers 
could just jump to whatever portions they wanted.
[This would take some additional labor by someone who
was more familiar with writing web pages than I.]

You should already be able to jump to whichever parts
you want to read. . .simply use your search commands,
search for "*" plus the section header as outlined in
The Table of Contents.


2.
Redivide PT1 of the Weekly Newsletter into two parts.

[This would create a lot more work for whomever edits
the Newsletters, which probably wouldn't be so bad if
that were their only responsibility.  I work to point
of exhaustion nearly every single day, and I need for
things to become easier rather than harder.  Hence my
requests for anyone who would like to be editor:  the
format of the Newsletter would be their choice and we
could either turn over the statistics to them, or our
stats people could simply send in that portion, ahead
of the deadline by an hour or two.  We would continue
to encourage our readers to send in news items not in
the main regular media coverage.]


*

We are interested in increasing the "SF" available at Project Gutenberg of
Australia. To this end we are happy to receive donations of ebooks to add
to our collection.

SF, in this context can mean: Science, Speculative, Superhero, Swords,
Sorcery, Spies, Supernatural and Scary Fiction.

Of course, we are only able to accept works that are public domain in
Australia.

Generally speaking, this means that the author died in 1954 or earlier.

Please see our WANTED list at http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html for
authors and works of interest. If you have suggestions for authors or 
works to add to the list, please let us know.  Do check first that 
they are not already available at Project Gutenberg Australia or 
Project Gutenberg, please.  Contact details are provided on the WANTED page.

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

As always, ebooks by Australian authors and of general Australian interest
are always greatly appreciated.

               [Please note we have several counting methods,
               and they often differ by several book that we
               have to hunt down by hand to reconcile.]
               [Pleast note there is some duplication between
               these various collections.  Volunteers needed
               to take these duplications into account.]

                ~14% of the way from 20,000 to 30,000

               http://www.gutenberg.cc   [185,000+ files]

[Please note that the four collections totals are eBooks that originated
as created, edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and
its 50,000 volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with
100,000+ books contains entire eBook collections from 125+ eLibraries so
the production statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created
by the various teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share
the responsibility of maintaining.  The Consortia Center eBooks were and
are the responsibility of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy
to forward any suggestions for correction to those eLibraries, but those
eBooks must be edited by the donating parties, as per their requests.]

             18,374 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~266 eBooks per Month for ~68.75 Months

            3,297 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

            54 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
             9,165 total from Distributed Proofreaders
              Since October, 2000 [Details in PT1B]
              [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]
            [Note, PGDP mostly included in US eBooks]
         [Note, PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders
          whose total closely matches their grand total]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]


       We Are Averaging ~366 eBooks Per Month This Year!!!
              [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 85 eBooks Per Week In 2006
                        79 This Week
                        58 Last Week
                       355 This Month [Sep]


It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our first 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~12.5 years from Jan. 1994 to Jun. 2006 to go from 100 to 20,100

It took ~32 months, from 2003 to 2006 for our last 10,000 eBooks

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to 20,000

It took ~2.3 years from Jan. 2004 to Aug. 2006 from 11,000 to 21,000

Not counting the addition of The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center's
Receipt of ~100,000 eBooks from 125+ Other eLibraries Worldwide.

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements


General Catalog of Old Books and Authors

http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm

which now indexes 24,000 books available free online, including all
PG(US) & PG(Aus)'s books, along with some basic date information
about them and their authors where you can find more.

Plus many books not available on line, a good place to search
for books by specific authors who you are interested in.

For information please contact Philip Harper
<webmaster AT kingkong.demon.co.uk>

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is an experimental online reader available.
Start from any bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

*Project Gutenberg Consortia Center Report

The PGCC collection at http://www.gutenberg.cc has doubled
in size from the listings below, but we don't have exactly
matching collection sizes yet for a new breakdown.

There are ~185,000 separate downloadable files,
and presuming 45% are reduntant or are required
at the level of more than one file per book:

The number of individual eBooks now is about 100,000.

Thus the grand total of eBooks at Project Gutenberg
is 21,000+ created by Project Gutenberg volunteers,
and 100,000 donated from over 125 other eLibraries,
to create a downloadble library of 100,000+ eBooks

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar

happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES



Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars Worth or a Trillion eBooks Yet???


If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,548,263,653 that would be 21,445 x 65,482,637 = ~1.40 Trillion !!!

With 21,455 eBooks online as of October 04, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.71 from each book.
[1% world population x #eBooks] 65,482,637 x 21,455 x $.71 = ~$1 Trillion

[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]
[By the way, the US "popclock" is about to turn to 300 million people.]
[Just turning 299.9 million this week!]

    U.S. 299,901,719
    World 6,548,263,653
    16:24 GMT (EST+5) Oct 04, 2006

      Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the equivalent of Eastern Standard Time
         (EST) plus 5 hours or Daylight Saving Time (DST) plus 4 hours.


A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.47 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 21,455 eBooks online as of October 04, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.47 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.58 when we had 17,248 eBooks a year ago.

[This is not counting the 100,000 eBooks at http://gutenberg.cc which are
counted and maintained separately by their donating electronic libraries]

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100 million people.

Next Decade's Target:  15% Of The world Population = 1 billion !!! people.


At 21,455 eBooks in 35 Years and 03.00 Months We Averaged
       609 Per Year
        51 Per Month
         1.67 Per Day

At 3297 eBooks Done In The 273 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
    12.1 Per Day
      85 per Week
     366 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 299M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 80% the way to 300M, so
it will probably be 2 more weeks to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

*

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


BERKELEY PUTS COURSE VIDEO ONLINE
In an arrangement with Google, the University of California, Berkeley,
will make available online considerable amounts of videotaped course
content, including lectures, speeches, special events, and, in some
cases, entire courses. UC Berkeley is the only institution with its own
page on the Google Video Web site, and the course materials are
available for public use. Dan Mogulof, director of public affairs at UC
Berkeley, said, "We are a public university. We have fabulous faculty
and incredible events. We want to share the wealth across the state,
country, and world." UC Berkeley is not the first university to post
course materials online, but its program is one of the broader
initiatives, given the amount of content and the fact that it is open
to anyone. Officials from the university said they expect other
institutions to launch similar efforts.

DEAL REACHED FOR ONLINE MUSIC ROYALTIES
Songwriters and record companies in Britain reached an agreement over
royalties for online music sales just as a copyright tribunal that
would have decided the issue went into session. In the dispute, record
companies were represented by the British Phonographic Industry, and
Adam Singer represented songwriters. Singer heads the
Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society Ltd and the Performing Right
Society Ltd. Songwriters and composers had sought a royalty rate of 12
percent, an increase from the existing rate of 8 percent. Record
companies wanted the rate to drop to 6.5 percent. In the final
negotiations, both sides agreed to accept the 8 percent rate for three
more years, which amounts to about 10 cents per song sold on Apple's
iTunes service. The tribunal accepted the settlement, which is legally
binding only in the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, experts said the deal
could influence similar negotiations in other countries, including the
United States and Germany.

SAN JOSE STATE TRIES TO BAN SKYPE
Administrators at San Jose State University (SJSU) have temporarily
suspended a ban on Internet phone service Skype but said they would
reinstitute the prohibition if concerns over network usage are not
adequately addressed. A number of universities have blocked use of
Skype because of language in the user agreement that appears to allow
individuals not associated with the university to use the campus
network for phone calls. Skype works by routing calls through available
networks, even for third parties, using computers of users who have
accepted the company's terms of use. "It's a fairly subtle problem,"
said Kevin Schmidt, campus network programmer at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, which has also banned Skype. He said the
result could be "fair amount of traffic that has nothing to do with
university business." Following the ban at SJSU, many students and
faculty objected, saying the service has become vital to their efforts
to keep in touch with families overseas and to promote educational
programs around the globe. Campus officials acknowledged those concerns
but said that if eBay, which owns Skype, cannot address the problem,
the service will be shut off.

UNIVERSITY IN SPAIN JOINS GOOGLE BOOK SEARCH
The Complutense University of Madrid has joined Google's controversial
Book Search project, making it the first institution from a
non-English-speaking country to take part. The university maintains the
second-largest library in Spain, with 3 million volumes; only the
National Library is larger. In addition to books in Spanish, the
library also houses texts in French, German, Latin, Italian, and
English. A spokesperson from Google said the deal with Complutense
University "will be a huge boost to our Spanish-language content, as
well as other languages." Publishers and copyright holders have
objected to the project, whose goal is to digitize millions of texts
and make them available online. Google maintains the project is for the
public good; publishers say that even if full texts are not available
online for protected works, Google is nonetheless violating their
rights by scanning those books.

LIBRARIES DEVELOP NEW ARCHIVING APPLICATION
Working under the auspices of the International Internet Preservation
Consortium, the National Library of New Zealand and the British Library
have developed a Web curator tool to archive online content. Because
Web pages change constantly, efforts to preserve important online
material present complex challenges for gathering and preserving that
content. The new tool automates the process of harvesting online
content and storing it. Stephen Green, Web archiving program manager at
the British Library, said the tool would initially be focused on sites
deemed important to British culture, such as those of political parties
and about the London bombings of July 7. By the end of the year, the
Web curator tool will be offered as an open source application to other
organizations.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

Besides all the references to the National Intelligence Estimate
that said the US is causing more terrorism via its trowback uses
of gunboat diplomacy in the Middle East, several officers in the
command positions in Iraq had the following comments this week.

The officers were, Major General John Batiste, Major General
Paul Eaton, and Colonel Paul Hammes.  Batiste was commander
of the 1st Infantry Division, and was also the senior military
aide to Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and blames Congress
for not asking "the tough questions."  He also mentioned threats
by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to fire anyone who said
he needed a postwar strategy.

In comments earlier this spring, General Batiste added, "the current
administration repeatedly ignored sound military advice and counsel
with respect to the war plans. I think the principles of war are
fundamental, and we violate those at our own peril."

Around the same time Commanding General Anthony Zinni, of the
Central Command in Iraq had the following additional comments:

"I think we are paying the price for lack of credible planning, or 
the lack of a plan. We are throwing away 10 years of planning, in
effect, for underestimating the situation we were going to get into
and for not adhering to the advice that was being given to us by others.''

Major General Eaton said referred to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld
as "incompetent, stragically, operationally, and tactically," and
added "Mr. Rumsfeld and his immediate team must be replaced or we
will see two more years of extraordinaily bad decision making."

Eaton was in command of U.S. efforts to train the Iraq military
until the last election.

Earlier this year he wrote the following to the New York Times:

"Rumsfeld has put the Pentagon at the mercy of his ego, his Cold
Warrior's view of the world and his unrealistic confidence in
technology to replace manpower. As a result, the US Army finds itself
severely undermanned. . .cut to 10 active divisions but asked by the
administration to support a foreign policy that requires at least 12
or 14," [active divisions].



DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

The various declassifying of minimal pages of the National
Intelligence Estimate that only support the administration,
but leave out the entire portion that said the U.S. caused
more problems than it solved by invading Iraq.

U.S. LAW ATTACKS ONLINE GAMBLING
President George W. Bush is expected to sign legislation passed by the
U.S. Congress outlawing Internet gambling in the United States. The
law, called the Safe Port Act, was passed Saturday. The legislation
could halve the $12 billion Internet gambling industry. Several
companies have already suspended operations in the United States.

[Of course no one is mentioning that this is not to protect gambling addicts,
but merely becaues the U.S. hasn't figured out a way to tax Internet gambling.]


*QUOTES OF THE WEEK

"No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or
consider any claim or cause of action whatsoever, including any
action pending on or filed after the date of the enactment of the
Military Commissions Act of 2006, relating to the prosecution,
trial, or judgment of a military commission under this chapter,
including challenges to the lawfulness of procedures of military
commissions under this chapter."

That's a section of the "Torture Bill" US Congress just passed.

If the balance between copyright and the public domain "is lost,
we will violate the the nature of knowledge itself."

Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil, of Brazil

At the opening of the General Assembly of the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) yesterday in Geneva the Brazilian
Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil warned against losing sight of
"a balance between intellectual property rights and obligations
and the public interest. If such balance is lost," the minister
according to a blog report by a WIPO observer from CPTech said,
"we will violate the nature of knowledge itself." Citing Thomas
Jefferson the minister added that "there would not be any one
thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property than
ideas, whose sharing does not necessarily harm anyone." The WIPO
General Assembly is the highest decision-making body of the
member states. In negotiations that will extend until October 3
the member states will work out the WIPO's program for next year.

*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Just as the rich keep getting richer,
and the poor keep getting poorer,
the distance between the various
portions of humanity will increase,
and the reason won't matter. . .
any reason will do. . .the reasons
for wars are usually fabrications
to increase that distance. . . .


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

47% of female students said they would not raise their hands
in class even if they knew the answer for fear of harassment
for being smart.

Yahoo mail just passed 250,000,000 [1/4 billion] users.

That is equal to the tnire U.S. population of teens and above.

The U.S. population should reach 300 million officially this week.

Electronic Trading Surpasses Mercantile Exchange Pit Trading

Last Thurs might have been the first day on the CME where there
were more commodities traded via electronic trading than on the 
actual floor of the exchange. CME = Chicago Mercantile Exchange
[Various single commodities had done this before, not sure if a
grand total of all trade had been a majority electronic before]

/

By the way, for those interested, the official U.S. population
estimates just passed 299 million, though many say estimations
of this nature leave out as much as 5% of the population, with
the obvious exclusion of the 11-12 million immigrant workers
now being mentioned so much in the news.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
is obviously no longer 6% of the world.  In fact, rounding to the
nearest percent, the US will soon fall from 5% to 4%.]

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
