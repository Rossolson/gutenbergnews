I am including a self-published not about eBook readers for cell phones
with a warning from some of our other cell phone eBook experts that the
process mentioned below might cost quite a bit more than we expected.

ACCESS YOUR EBOOKS FROM YOUR MOBILE PHONE
mTextbox is the easiest way to bring your text, articles, even full length
novels with you on your mobile phone. You can upload your own text and
access it from your mobile phone, or browse the online library to see what
others are reading. The service is free during the alpha period, which runs
until the end of the year.

Thank you,

NOTES:

Project Gutenberg Australia total does NOT include PGAu eBooks posted at the
U.S. site: www.gutenberg.org

We have several counting methods, and they often differ by several books
that we have to hunt down by hand to reconcile. There is also some
duplication between these various collections. Volunteers will need to take
these duplications into account.

The totals for the four collections are eBooks that originated as created,
edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and its 50,000
volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with 100,000+ books
contains entire eBook collections from 125+ eLibraries so the production
statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created by the various
teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share the responsibility
of maintaining. The Consortia Center eBooks were and are the responsibility
of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy to forward any suggestions
for correction to those eLibraries, but those eBooks must be edited by the
donating parties, as per their requests.


=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=[ OTHER STATISTICS ]=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=

SNAIL MAIL (DVD & CD)
Over 15 million eBooks have been sent out via snail mail!!!


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS:
9,268 [+25] at Distributed Proofreaders

The Distributed Proofreaders started production in October 2000 and
currently has over 36,000 volunteers.

For more complete DP statistics, visit:
http://www.pgdp.net/c/stats/stats_central.php

NOTE: PGDP mostly included in US eBooks
NOTE: PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders whose total closely matches
      their grand total.


PGCC - PROJECT GUTENBERG CONSORTIA CENTER REPORT
137,142 eBooks at PGCC

The PGCC collection at http://www.gutenberg.cc has doubled in size from the
listings below, but we don't have exactly matching collection sizes yet for a
new breakdown.

There are ~185,000 separate downloadable files, and presuming 45% are
redundant or are required at the level of more than one file per book:

The number of individual eBooks now is about 100,000.

Thus the grand total of eBooks at Project Gutenberg is 21,000+ created by
Project Gutenberg volunteers, and 100,000 donated from over 125 other
eLibraries, to create a downloadable library of 100,000+ eBooks plus 80,000
donated from over 100 other eLibraries, to create a downloadable library of
100,000+ eBooks.

PGCC's current eBook and eDocument Collections listings of 18 collections with
this week's listing as:

=======Grand Total Files=======  ~137,142 Total Files  ========

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


DAILY PREPRINTS
378 [+1] at Daily PrePrints

Stats available at: http://preprints.readingroo.ms

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire collections to fully
appear in the PrePrints Section, thus the count sometimes jumps by a large
number when the files are eventually completed and added in. Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move later to other
locations, including the main collection or The Project Gutenberg Consortia
Center, etc. For example, on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks
appeared, and will likely be moved to other collection points later.

The entire process of working out the details just to send them to the PrePrints
Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section, it still takes a
certain amount of time to collect and put such a large collection online in a
proper manner.


THE ONLINE BOOKS PAGE
25,000 eBooks are listed via The Online Books Page

NOTE: 6,300 of these are from PG.


INTERNET PUBLIC LIBRARY
22,284 entries at IPL

The Internet Public Library (IPL) had a similar listing to The Online Books Page
which is now in limbo. If anyone knows what is happening with the IPL, please
let us know. Inquiries, made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:
http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended its first incarnation
with about 22,284 entries, which has now been surpassed by the Online Books
Page.

We are still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

The Dairyman's Daughter, by Legh Richmond                                19615
   [Link: http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/6/1/19615 ]
   [Files: 19615.txt; 19615-h.htm]
   (David Price writes:  For those wishing to know: Legh Richmond(1772-1927)
    was curate at Brading on the Isle of Wight (England) when he met Elizabeth
    Wallbridge, the daughter of a poor local dairyman.  Elizabeth had recently
    undergone a religious conversion and some of her letters to Legh are
    contained in the book.  Legh's account of Elizabeth was published after her
    death and became a best-seller.  Readers of George Borrow (see Lavengro in
    Project Gutenberg) will know that a lot of his story revolves around "The
    Dairyman's Daughter" and may not be aware that the latter was a real book.
    Project Gutenberg now has both books.)

   (David Price writes: For those wishing to know: Samuel Butler provides
    a selection from his previous books (as published by 1884).  There's
    Erewhon, Fair Haven, Life and Habit etc.  He also adds new material on
    evolution and a short poem at the end.  Butler took the opportunity to
    rewrite some passages and so the text in this book doesn't always match
    the originals.)
