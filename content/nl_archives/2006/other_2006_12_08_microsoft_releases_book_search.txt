"Microsoft is releasing its Live Search Books, a rival to Google's
Book Search, in test, or beta, version in the US. The digital archive
will include books from the collections of the British Library, the
University of California and the University of Toronto. Books from
three other institutions will be added in January 2007. All the books
currently included in the project will be non-copyrighted but later it
will also add copyrighted work that publishers have given permission
to include in the project."
