Weekly_July_04.txt
The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, July 04, 2006 PT1
****eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971*****


                !!! SPECIAL 35TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION !!!

This Newsletter contains a list of the various 35th anniversary events.

Normally the Newsletter comes out on Wedneday, but we're doing this one
a little bit early for the occasion, in fact, _I_ will be the best man,
at my best friend's wedding during this period, so I am writing this in
plenty of advance time, and am actually going to mail this advance copy
to everyone nearly a week early in the hopes that some of our editors I
am hoping will take over the Newsletter will find the time that week to
put in the actual numbers, the following are just my own estimates, but
I am updating them constantly.  The estimates I am using for July 5 are
for 100 eBooks per week for the last two weeks.  We had 102 last week--
so I am counting on 98 this week.


                             HEADLINES

    Original Project Gutenberg Newsletter Count Hits 20,000 !!!!!!!
    [This includes PG Australia, PG Europe, and PrePrints Section];
    plus over 75,000 at the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, the
    grand total of all sites is now nearly 100,000.  The PGCC has a
    number of eBook collections donated from about 100 eLibraries.

*Project Gutenberg Consortia Center Report

The PGCC collection at http://www.gutenberg.cc has doubled

matching collection sizes yet for a new breakdown.

Soon there should be eBooks representing 100 collections.

of 18 collections. . .with this week's listing as:

CIA's Electronic Reading Room,      2,019 Reference Files
=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~34,286 Unique eBooks

The new overall collection size, which has reduced the
need to account for duplications and eBooks with files
for each chapter, etc.
                                  ~75,000 Unique eBooks

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet?

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,525,015,623 that would be 20,200 x 65,250,156 = ~1.31 Trillion !!!

With 20,200 eBooks online as of July 04, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.76 from each book.
[1% world population x #eBooks] 65,250,156 x 20,200 x $.76 = ~$1 Trillion
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]
[By the way, the US "popclock" is about to turn to 300 million people.]
[Just turned 299 million last week!]

A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.50 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 20,200 eBooks online as of July 04, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.50 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.60 when we had 16,633 eBooks a year ago.

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100,000,000 people.


At 20,200 eBooks in 35 Years We Averaged
       577 Per Year
        48 Per Month
         1.58 Per Day

At 2052 eBooks Done In The 182 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
    11.3 Per Day
      79 per Week
     342 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 298M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 1/6 the way to 299M, so
it will probably be 10 more weeks to 299M and 22 more to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.
