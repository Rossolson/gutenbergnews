A NOTE FROM THE EDITOR

Just a little note to inform everyone why there has been very little news
content recently in the newsletter and on the website.

At the end of June I relocated from sunny old England to München, Germany.
As you can imagine, there has not been much time to spare for the
newsletter. Unfortunately this is likely continue for another few of weeks.

In the meantime, if you have any news or articles you would like added to
the newsletter then please email them to editor_@_gutenbergnews.org.

Thank you for your understanding.

-- Michael Cook [Ed]

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
