NEWSLETTER DISRUPTIONS

At the end of November 2007 I am having to move apartments again. This means
I will not be able to send out the newsletter for at least one week...the
very least!

I am hoping that Michael Hart will be able to fill in but this is yet to be
confirmed. So, if there are any volunteers out there who would like to take
over for a short time please contact me as soon as possible, using the
following email address; editor@gutenbergnews.org

Many thanks for your patience.

-- Michael Cook [Ed]


THE POLL RESULTS!

So here they are, after...err, several months, the final results from the
'How many e-texts have you read from the PG archives?' Poll. Even after all
this time there are still only 50 votes cast.

Top of the list is 200+ e-text read from the PG archives but the big surprise
for me is that the 50-100 e-texts does not come in at a higher position.

Thanks to everyone who participated and...keep on reading.

RESULTS: How many e-texts have you read from the PG archives?
 * 30% -- 200+
 * 22% -- 1-10
 * 20% -- 10-20
 * 10% -- 20-50
 * 10% -- 50-100
 *  8% -- 100-200

Total Votes: 50

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.

subtitle.  Also, the author is now Various to reflect the different
authorship of the 8 stories in the book, edited by Rossiter Johnson.
