NEWS HEADLINES
--------------

Our little automated daily report didn't come in today, that would have 
reflected PG prodution thru Wednesday-- our official production years, 
months, weeks, run from noon the first Wedneaday per year and month, so it 
may be TWO weeks before we get the final numbers of 2007.

Right now my personal estimate for 2007 is 4250. . . .

For this past week, something like 90.

And, PG Australia is coming up on their 1600th, maybe by the end of January.

In addition, the new PG of Chinese has taken off with a bang, having moved 
through our 50+ languages with a last week's total in the Top 10, and now 
moving quite rapidly into the Top 5.

We have about 400 chinese works cleared, and they are going online at record 
rates, having passed Italian-- just between last Friday and this Wednesday 
noon.

It would also appear we passed 26,000 PG originals as of this past week.

LOTS of things to look forward to in 2008!!!
