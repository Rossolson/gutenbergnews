PROJECT GUTENBERG TV PERSONALITY NEEDED

A four part series on the history of reading currently in production is
looking for a Project Gutenberg volunteer to participate.
Ideally, this individual has had a long involvement with Project Gutenberg,
has uploaded vast numbers of books, speaks passionately about the role of
books in society and the need for universal access to texts
[ergo Project Gutenberg] and has some compelling personal reason for their
participation.

If at all interested, please contact Judy at jruzylo@sympatico.ca.

We would be looking to shoot in mid to late summer and would be happy to
travel to where you are.

The films are being produced in Toronto with a French co-producer. The roster
of stories is international. It is presently slated to air in the fall 2008
in Canada (in English and French), Australia, France, Netherlands and on a
couple specialty satellite channels.

We have had some discussions with PBS as the American broadcaster but have no
firm commitment to date.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
