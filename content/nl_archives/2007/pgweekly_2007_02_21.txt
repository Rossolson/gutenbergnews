                       TRENCH ON WORDS - A REVIEW C.1928

Recently Brett Fishburne was going through some donated books and came
across a copy of "Trench on Words", which is already in the PG collection
(text #6480), that had a newspaper review glued to the front.

The newspaper title from which the review was printed was not in the
information that was glued to the front of the book. He believes that the
newspaper was from Buffalo, New York and the review to have been written in
1928. Parts of the review were torn and lost, but thinks he was able to
accurately fill in the words (placed in square brackets) that were missing.
He believes with some certainty that this review did not come from the
New York Times as he researched their archives thoroughly.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, although
there are some non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-EU only. At the end of
2006 the non-clearable number was 65. This is a first stage count using the
Newsletter Archives as source. Eventually those will be checked against the
gutenberg.org online database.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may
move later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
