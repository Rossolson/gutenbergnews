PG CANADA STATISTICS

I have now included the PG-CA numbers into the overall stats. PG-CA works in
the same way as PG-EU. They have many books posted to both the main PG
arvhives along with their own. Therefore I am only counting the 'Unique'
posts, those that are posted only to the Canadian site, towards the 'Total'
number of PG eBooks.


500 AND RISING - THE AL HAINES MILESTONE

A short while ago I started a poll to see how many PG e-texts people have
read. If the votes can be trusted then there are currently over 36%, pretty
spiffy thought I, until I heard the latest from Greg Newby.

If you think reading several hundred PG e-texts is quite something then the
feat of Al Haines must be even more impressive.

This week Al Haines prepared and submitted his 500th e-book to
Project Gutenberg!

The Books of the New Testament, by Leighton Pullan                       22459
  [This is the 500th e-book prepared by Al Haines for Project Gutenberg!]
  [Link: http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/4/5/22459 ]
  [Files: 22459.txt; 22459-8.txt; ]
  [Clearance: 20070627150549pullan]

On behalf of Project Gutenberg I would like to send our congratulations
to Al on this fantastic milestone. I also have a message from Project
Gutenberg CEO, Greg Newby;

  Al Haine is a highly valued volunteer who does quality work. His
  contributions to the Project Gutenberg library are a pleasure to read, and
  I always look forward to Al’s next title. His dedication to free online
  literature is an inspiration.


SHAKESPEAREAN ACTORS WANTED

Along with the thousands of text files that Project Gutenberg has to offer
there are also many audio recordings. For many people these are great ways
to get to know the works of different authors.

Recently Michael Hart recieved a request from Tina Hansen,

"I notice that your site offers a number of audio books, both human
narrated and computer generated. I am pleased that you are adding more
books read by voice talent. I wish to suggest that adding a
human-narrated version of Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream
would be of value to anyone visiting the site. You do have this done
with an electronic voice, but I must be honest when I say that doing
any Shakespeare play with an electronic voice just doesn't sound the
same as it does when you get a group of competent voices together. The
electronic voices simply lack the nuances to make these works come
alive for the reader. Instead, the listener is likely to dose off.
Thus, I suggest that a call be put out for a version of this text done
by competent actors. I'm sure that there are plenty of theater groups
around the country who would be more than happy to take on this
project. Thanks."

As the son of a Shakespeare professor Michael Hart was in complete agreement.

Therefore Project Gutenberg would like to put out a request for any persons
or avid Shakespeare theatre groups to step forward and volunteer to make
these.

If you are unsure on how to go about making these recordings then visit
the LibriVox (librivox.org) website. There's lot of information on the website
to help you get started.


PRESS RELEASE: THE MOBILE LIBRARY

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
