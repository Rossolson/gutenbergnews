THE OPENLEARN PROJECT

The openlearn project makes educational resources, taken from Open University
courses, freely available to anyone, anywhere in the world with access to the
internet. Published under a Creative Commons copyright license, users are
free to download, remix and share the material under the same license.

The Open University itself was founded in the late 1960’s with a mission to
make higher education available to those who had previously been excluded.
Similar to Project Gutenberg’s aim to "break down the bars of ignorance and
illiteracy" openlearn seeks to make its educational material globally
available to those wish to use it.

Openlearn units cover all manner of subjects from Arts & History, to Study
Skills, to IT and Computing. A full list of subject areas is available at
http://openlearn.open.ac.uk.

Areas of interest to those involved in the creation of ebooks might include
Design, Accessibility in Interaction Design, Presenting Information and
ICTs: Device to Device Communication. Units that might be effectively turned
into ebooks include Hume, Living with the Internet: Keeping It safe,
Evolution Through Natural Selection, Global Warming and Learning How to Learn
Anyone wishing to reuse openlearn material should consult the openlearn FAQs
on Intellectual Property or contact Stuart Brown at s.a.brown@open.ac.uk.


FIRST CEBUANO EBOOK ON PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg of the Philippines (http://www.gutenberg.ph) is happy to
announce the release of the first Cebuano Ebook, Larawan: Mga Sugilanon ug
Dinalídalí, a collection of short stories by Vicente Rama (1887-1956).
Originally, these stories where published in Cebu in 1921.

The stories give a humorous glimpse back into the life in Cebu in the early
twenties of the last century, and, besides that provide a nice reader for
students of the Cebuano language.

The book can be downloaded from http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/20820.
Due to their age, the copyright on these stories has expired, which means that
Project Gutenberg can make them available for free, and with hardly any
restrictions on their use and re-use.

This addition also marks the addition of a third Philippine language to
Project Gutenberg (next to Tagalog and Iloko) and the 51st language to
Project Gutenberg.

POLL: RESULTS

Should PG 'officially' adopt a XML, TEI or similar Master File?

NO, we should stick with Plain-Vanilla ASCII files.
  29 (49.2%)
YES, this is a must!
  23 (39%)
I haven't a clue what you're talking about.
   4 (6.8%)
It's really not that important.
   3 (5.1%)

Except for the last few days it's been a close call between those in favour
and those against, with each taking it in turn for the top spot. With a total
of only 59 votes it's difficult to take a real hard stance on the subject but
there is certainly a good percentage of people in favour of this approach.

As for an official statement - Michael Hart has been noted as saying that he
doesn't want to 'enforce' any one format but is happy for any one to
contribute their own formats to the PG collection.

So, if you are one of those in favour then the best thing you can do now is
start converting over those PG texts.

Marking up texts in the TEI format not only makes it easier to convert to
other formats (PDF, HTML, etc) but can also produce Plain-Vanilla texts.
Over the coming weeks I am hoping to present some information on the PG-TEI
implementation, tools to help in creating the PG-TEI mark-up and web links.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Grand Total and not the overall PG-EU
total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
