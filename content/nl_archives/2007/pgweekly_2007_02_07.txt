NOTES:

At the start of 2007, the PG-US total was adjusted by -350 to take into
consideration the duplications from PG-EU. Please remember that other totals
may also reflect this change.
This figure of -350 is only approximate, we will update once we have received
the exact number of duplications from PG-EU.

We have several counting methods that often differ by several books. There
is also some duplication between the various collections. Volunteers will
need to take these duplications into account.

The PG Australia total does NOT include PG-AU eBooks posted at the U.S.
website; www.gutenberg.org.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire collections to fully
appear in the PrePrints Section, thus the count sometimes jumps by a large
number when the files are eventually completed and added in. Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move later to other
locations, including the main collection or The Project Gutenberg Consortia
Center, etc. For example, on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks
appeared, and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send them to the
PrePrints Section took well over a month.
Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section, it still takes a
certain amount of time to collect and put such a large collection online in a
proper manner.

==============================[ OTHER STATISTICS ]==============================

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS (PG-DP)
9,848 [+33] at Distributed Proofreaders.

The Distributed Proofreaders started production in October 2000 and currently
has over 36,000 volunteers.

For more complete DP statistics, visit:

NOTE: PG-DP mostly included in U.S. eBooks
NOTE: PG-EU has its own Distributed Proofreaders whose total closely matches
      their grand total.
