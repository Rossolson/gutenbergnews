**Project Gutenberg's Weekly Newsletter for Wednesday, August 8, 2001**

***  Please check that your email address for me is hart@pobox.com  ***
[This will relay to my other addresses]

I haven't been able to use my normal emailbox yesterday and today,
so the news features and some other parts of this Newsletter are
somewhat limited. . .never let anyone forget that somehow, even
through all the crashes, we have never actually missed a date to
do a Newsletter, except on a few rare occasions when Wednesday
fell on New Year's Day and the like. . .someday we will miss,
but not yet. . .here are 20 more books for your collection.

Many of you have come to rely on these Newsletters as matters of course,
but the truth is that only _I_ know just how close we usually are to NOT
getting the Etexts done, or not getting the Newsletters out on time.

It really is *AMAZING* that we have never really missed one, or missed
our promised goals of how many Etexts we would produce in a given month,
even though I *intended* that we would this past month. . .to get us to
fall back more in line with our "official" schedule. . . .

I will get more detailed reports shortly, but it appears that we may
have actually produced about 1,000 new Etexts from July 4, 2000 to
July 4, 2001. . .please note this actually contained the work from
13 calendar months. . .AND. . .we have cut down the number of those
Etexts listed as *reserved*. . .so the production has been greater
than it actually appears. . . .

In addition, I would like to take a moment I have been considering
for several weeks now to give public thanks to our two David's,
David Widger and David Price who have pretty much single handedly
[they did all but two of this week's contributions, as I recall]
saved me from having to write up the shortest Newsletter of recent
memory, especially given all the other hassles I've had this week.

My HUGE Thanks!!!!!!!

Michael

has been $1250. . .no kidding. . .but they can't do this without some $$$.
If you can keep us running until the end of this year, they want me to be
primarily into fundraising and public relations, since I am the only one
willing to do that sort of thing, and we have finally found at least one
more volunteer than Greg Newby who is willing to post Etext when I am gone.

organization with EIN [Employee Identification Number] 64-6221541

***News Headlines From Newsscan and Edupage***


E-BOOKS SAID TO BE "UTTERLY UNNEEDED"
According to publishing consultant Jim Lichtenberg, the e-book business is
floundering: "There's no standardization in technology. It's all a big
mess. This is like having a car in 1905. It breaks down constantly, which
means you have to travel with your own mechanic--and since there are no
roads, there's nowhere to go anyway." Prize-winning novelist Kurt Vonnegut
agrees: "The e-book is a ridiculous idea. The printed book is so
satisfactory, so responsive to our fingertips. So much of this new stuff is
utterly unneeded."  But a spokesman for Random House [see Honorary
Subscriber section below] thinks that reports of the demise of the e-book
is greatly exaggerated, and that its potential is yet to be realized.(Los
Angeles Times 6 Aug 2001)

COURT BACKS ONLINE RADIO RULING
The broadcasting industry suffered a setback Wednesday when a U.S. district
judge threw out a challenge to the U.S. Copyright Office, which ruled last
year that radio stations must pay additional royalties to stream music over
the Internet. The National Association of Broadcasters responded that the
ruling would upset a long-standing, mutually beneficial relationship
between the broadcasting and recording industries. "Broadcasters currently
pay in excess of $300 million annually in music licensing fees to
compensate songwriters and music publishers. Any additional fee to
compensate record companies would be unfair and unreasonable," said NAB
president and CEO Edward O. Fritts. The ruling was hailed as a victory by
the Recording Industry Association of America. "Any licensing fees that
these companies would be paying would pale in comparison... to the cost to
stream their signal over the Internet," said RIAA senior VP Steven M.
Marks. (AP 2 Aug 2001)

CAMPUS CLICKS
The Internet's role in the life of college students--from
academic research to socializing--is growing, according to a
survey conducted by Greenfield Online. The study found that 78
percent of college students have been accessing the Web for at
least three years, and 90 percent are online three hours a day.
(Gannett News Service, 1 August 2001)


PC MAKERS ARE READY FOR SCHOOL
PC makers are readying for the back-to-school season early this
year, eager to cash in on August and September sales, which
traditionally constitute up to 20 percent of a year's total.
Along with marketing programs are special deals struck with
school districts, as between Hillsborough County Public School
District in Florida and Compaq. Compaq is allowing Hillsborough
to buy computers in bulk for resale to parents, including
refurbished and overstocked systems, in return for a percentage
of the profits and a discount off the retail price. Other
manufacturers are looking to cash in on the increasing number of
colleges and universities requiring incoming students to have PCs
or laptop computers. Circuit City's Jim Babb said between 10
and 15 percent of all higher education campuses now require their
students to have computers.
