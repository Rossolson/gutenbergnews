The Project Gutenberg *Weekly* Newsletter for Wednesday, June 13, 2001

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*


If you have sent in Etexts to be posted, but are not sure they have been,
or have sent in copyright research, please let me know [hart@pobox.com].

If our catalog on gutenberg.net [promo.net/pg] misses them, please let Alev,
our Chief Cataloguer know Alev Akman <alevwho@mediaone.net>.  She is sure
she is up to date with all the entries she has, but some may not have been
received in her email, or could have been lost in various crashes.


When we send out the Project Gutenberg Newsletters, we
have already posted all the files listed in that index
listing we include in the Newsletters [excepting those
marked as "reserved," of course.

While our human cataloguers and indexers of course can
not had time to add them to their files yet, computers
will already have them listed. . .and thus you will be
able to download them, literally only one second after
we have started to post them, even before our own post
of them has been completely uploaded. . . !

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:
http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03
or
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91, 90.


You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.


We have a total of 20 new files to download this week:
[This would yield a total of 1040 new files per year.]







If you sent in a file you don't see here, or sent in a revision, or xeroxes
for our copyright research, and haven't heard from me let me know.  Most of
these should only take a few days.

For the moment I am leaving BOTH ironm10.* files AND the liron10.* files,
until enough time has passed for the indexes and catalogs to be updated]

COLOMBIA'S '.CO' SET TO CHALLENGE '.COM'
Colombia's La Universidad de Los Andes, which has managed the country's
".co" country code since 1991, is inviting bids from companies that would
market the name internationally as a convenient substitute for ".com." The
proceeds would be used for scholarships and investments. "This thing has
the potential to be much larger than '.biz,'" says the president of
DomainRegistry.com. "It really means that everybody that has a '.com' name
has to lock up a '.co' name. It really is kind of holding a gun to the head
of registrants." The ".co" name has already made its debut in cyberspace as
part of ".co.uk," a domain name launched in the UK as an alternative to
".com." Unlike Tuvalu and Cocos Islands, which sold the rights to their
".tv" and ".cc" suffixes, the university is not selling the name, just
opening it up to other users. (Reuters 11 Jun 2001)

INTERNET BY THE NUMBERS
Here's a snapshot of current Internet activity. According to recent studies
by Media Metrix, Yahoo and MSN are each getting 12 million or more unique
daily visitors, in comparison to Passport (6.2 million), Hotmail (6.1
million), AOL (5.0 million), Netscape (3.2 million), eBay (2.8 million),
iwon (2.7 million), Microsoft.com (2.7 million), and Excite (2.6 million).
Sites in the portal, services, and entertainment categories get the most
visitors, with 58.9, 50.0, and 40.0 million unique daily visitors
respectively, followed by retail sites with 36.3 million and "corporate
presence" sites with 34.2 million. (Business 2.0 26 Jun 2001)

[and who warned about "Information Overload" first?
Perhaps it was this:]
"There comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something
that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have
useless facts elbowing out the useful ones." (Arthur Conan Doyle)


WINDOWS XP FEATURE CAN RE-EDIT OTHERS' SITES
Microsoft has added another controversial feature to its new
Windows XP product. The "Smart Tags" utility in Internet Explorer
adds hyperlinks to Web pages. The links take users to sites owned
or endorsed by Microsoft. Although the beta XP version in which
the utility was found may be changed before XP's release this
fall, observers say the existence of such a utility is disturbing.
Microsoft officials say the Smart Tags are meant to help users
find information on "under-linked" sites, and note that the tags
would be set to "off" in default mode. The company also says the
new Internet Explorer would work with other Smart Tag programs
developed by other vendors, although those of other vendors
would not be built into the system in the same way Microsoft's
product is.   (Wall Street Journal, 7 June 2001)

MICROSOFT "HIGHLY UNLIKELY" TO BECOME NETWORK CARRIER
Microsoft's new version of Windows XP, to be released this fall, will
include high-quality phone and directory features. The new system will
offer such features as the ability to follow a person anywhere the person
can be reached (desktop to home to cell phone, etc.), and will create the
possibility of important new revenue streams for Microsoft for subscription
services such as Caller ID and voice mail. Former Bell Labs researcher
David Isenberg predicts that "Microsoft is going to suck the value out of
telecommunications companies," but Microsoft senior vice president Craig
Mundie demurs: "I think it's highly unlikely that we will become a network
carrier. To the extent that we can add a cool capability, maybe it's
possible that we can make it a subscription service." Investment manager
Andrew J. Kessler sums up the situation this way: "The phone companies
should be increasingly worried." (New York Times 12 Jun 2001)
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/12/technology/12SOFT.html


NETSCAPE CEDES BROWSER WAR, WANTS TO BE A HUB
"The browser is the crown jewel," says Netscape president Jim Bankoff.
"However, six months from now you won't consider Netscape to be a browser
company." Instead, the new strategy calls for Netscape to function as a hub
for Time Warner media properties, including Fortune and Time magazines and
24-hour cable news network CNN. So far, about 18 Time Warner publication
and programming sites have been embedded in the toolbar that runs along the
top of the Netscape media site. Netscape is also broadening its reach
beyond the PC and has also recently struck deals for its browser to be used
in Sony's PlayStation2 and in Gateway's Touchpad. (Reuters 6 Jun 2001)

NETZERO, JUNO TO MERGE
NetZero and Juno Online Services, the two biggest providers of free
Internet access, will merge in an all-stock $71-million deal that is
expected to create the nation's second-largest Internet connection company.
The merged entity, called United Online, will have 7 million subscribers,
making it second behind AOL, which has about 30 million subscribers.
EarthLink claims 4.8 million users. Under the terms of the deal, NetZero
will own 61.5% of the new company with Juno owning the rest.

NEW CORPORATE SOFTWARE SEARCHES EVERYWHERE -- EVEN PERSONAL HARD DRIVES
New productivity software from AltaVista will allow companies to collect
data from anywhere in the organization: including not only corporate
networks but also individual e-mail accounts and employee PCs. The software
is able to search through more than 200 different computer applications and
recognize 30 different languages. Privacy advocates are worried. Attorney
Gregg Williams says: "This could open a real Pandora's Box. There are some
private things on office computers that you really don't want to know
about." And Richard Smith of the Privacy Foundation says the software is
"really dangerous" and warns that it "would hurt both companies and their
employees by damaging morale." But Dana Gardner of the Aberdeen Group has
little use for such concerns: "For every person that gets a little
embarrassed because some personal information gets passed around the
office, there are going to be more people who are able to find important
information that helps them close a sale with an important customer or
build a better mousetrap." (AP/Washington Post 12 Jun 2001)
