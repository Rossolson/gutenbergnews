OUR ONLY PAID JOB IS OPENING UP. . .APPLICATION INFO BELOW

***

Please put Project Gutenberg on your Christmas list now. . . .

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation wants to put me under
contract, which would be nice, as my gross income for the past ~32 months
has been $1250. . .no kidding. . .but they can't do this without some $$$.
If you can keep us running until the end of this year, they want me to be
primarily into fundraising and public relations, since I am the only one
willing to do that sort of thing, and we have finally found at least one
more volunteer than Greg Newby who is willing to post Etext when I am gone.

As of July 12, 2001 contributions are only being solicited from people in:
Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia,
Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 501(c)(3)
organization with EIN [Employee Identification Number] 64-6221541

We STILL need a volunteer in North Dakota to be our legal presence there.
No reply from last request. . .please ask your North Dakotan friends.

We need people in the following countries to handle "life +50" books,
such as 1984 and Animal Farm, by George Orwell, and more. . . .
We are hoping some people in these countries will make Etext sites.
WARNING!!!  Canada is hiding it, but they are contemplating moving
to "life +70". . .so if you want to get these and pass them on in
a legal manner. . .now is the time!!!  We have a site starting up
in Australia, so let me know if you would like to help it start!

Someone sent me a beautifully marginated message outlining some
proposals to work with Project Gutenberg Etexts, and I have not
been able to find the message again to reply. . .please resend!
