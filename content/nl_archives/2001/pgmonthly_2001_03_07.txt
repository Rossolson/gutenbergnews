This Newsletter is being sent from an alternate address, so please be
careful to reply to hart@pobox.com. . .more below on this.  Apologies

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for Wednesday, March 7, 2001

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*


Well, it's almost another set of minor miracles that have me here this
morning writing another Project Gutenberg Newsletter to you, filled up
not only with the 50+ Etexts you have come to expect, but with a great
collection of dictionaries, as well, for a total of about 75 Etexts.

A week ago I had no idea we would actually be able to present any more
than a handful of Etexts today, but we actually managed to add 53 more
just in the last 7 days, and some of them were posted more than once--
to present a more integrated index format for the dictionaries.

We are going to be working on some PERL scripts, etc., to automate the
process, so if you are a script writer or programmer with ideas on how
to add our header to Etexts and "fill in the blanks," please email me.

hart@pobox.com is usually the best address to email me at, rather than
just hitting the "reply" key. . .the reason is that right now I divide
my day between hart@prairienet.org for doing most of my email, and for
posting the books I tend to use hart@beryl.ils.unc.edu and then send a
few emails from there while I am directly working on the Etexts. . .it
is ok to send to BOTH hart@pobox.com these other addresses, I will get
two copies.

and

We have copyright clearances for a few people who didn't include their
email addresses with their title page xeroxes. . . .

Please include your email address when you send us snailmail. . .!

New Sites


New Site In Croatia
and for Projekt Dubravka in Croatian
http://gutenberg.ssivanic.hr
HTTP only (no FTP)


New site in Germany
ftp://ftp.tu-ilmenau.de/project_gutenberg

This site has been established around six weeks ago.
It updates on a daily base and has a good connection
(155Mbit) to the german research network where all
universities in germany are connected.


Our San Francisco site has a new address:
movie0.archive.org
cd pub/etext/etext02


By the time most of you read this, it will be my birthday. . . .
I was 24 when I started Project Gutenberg. . .so do the math....

;-)


You can read a "Slashdot" interview with me about Project Gutenberg:

and

You can see me on Japanese public television [NHK] on March 31, 11PM.

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.


With 3225 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.10 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.
*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

Next month we will try to reach #3333 for a "price" of $3.00 per copy
to have given away our goal of $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars]
with a total of 833 Etext titles from April, 2000 to April, 2001. . . .

This "cost" is down from $3.17 when we had 3150 Etexts on February 6
This "cost" is down from $3.23 when we had 3100 Etexts on January 3
This "cost" is down from $3.33 when we had 3000 Etexts on December 6
This "cost" is down from $3.40 when we had 2870 Etexts on October 18/Nov 1
This "cost" is down from $3.48 when we had 2870 Etexts on September 3
This "cost" is down from $3.55 when we had 2820 Etexts on August 16
This "cost" is down from $3.60 when we had 2775 Etexts on August 2
This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2650 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts in April

Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by 90 cents???
In a period of only 11 calendar months???  When we complete the July
2002 Etexts, we should have this "cost" down to under $3.00!!!

From: Michael Lynch <lynchm@johnmarshall.edu>

          I have an interest in the works of Joseph Altsheler, an
author of adventure stories for boys whose works are all public domain.
I am particularly interested in the Young Trailer series (as was Saul
Bellow who refers to two od the characters, Henry Ware and Timendiquas
in The Adventures of Augie March).  One title (Scouts of the Valley)
is already in Gutenberg.  Several others are:
The Young Trailers
The Free Rangers
Forest Runners: A Story of the Great War Trail in Early Kentucky
The Keepers of the Trail
The Border Watch

I can't scan right now, but would be happy to proof read if anyone else can
find and scan the texts.

Notes from News Scan and Edupage

SMARTPHONE PDA OFFERS C-PHONE, BROWSER, ORGANIZER
Verizon Wireless is introducing a new $499 7.3-ounce device called the
Kyocera Smartphone, which combines a cell phone with a personal digital
assistant based on the Palm operating system. It is one of the first phones
to include a mobile Internet browser that can access the Web either through
the wireless carrier or through the same Internet service the device's
owner uses on his or her desktop, and that can download full-text versions
of texts in the HTML language. (AP/USA Today 2 Mar 2001)

PUBLISHERS' SPAT HIGHLIGHTS E-BOOK DEBATE
Random House has filed suit against e-book startup RosettaBooks, accusing
it of illegally selling electronic versions of books by Random House
authors Kurt Vonnegut, William Styron and Robert B. Parker. RosettaBooks
CEO Arthur Klebanoff countered that his company has contracts with the
three authors to publish electronic versions of their works, and that
Random House is "wrong" to think it automatically has rights to publish
e-books just because it has the rights to the print versions. The suit goes
to the heart of a long-simmering debate between publishers and authors over
whether publishers have an automatic right to publish electronic versions
of books. Authors argue that the right must be specified in a contract,
much like foreign rights. (Wall Street Journal 28 Feb 2001)

VERISIGN EXPANDS DOMAIN NAMES
VeriSign's Network Solutions Internet registrar is tripling the number of
com, .net and .org Internet addresses available by processing
registrations in 60 additional languages. The new languages, including
Swedish, French, Spanish and German, cover 40 countries and will enable
organizations to register names with the accents and local characters of
their native languages. "One of the criticisms of the Internet over many
years is that it is too English," says Network Solutions executive Phil
Callan. "This is the internationalization of the Internet and provides an
opportunity for thousands of European businesses to get local domain names
in local languages." (Financial Times 25 Feb 2001)

[WARNING:  Verisign also intends to stop dealing in .net and .org domains]
