We created 31 new eTexts for you this week.

With 4038 eTexts online as of October 24, it now takes an average of
100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.48 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have alreacy given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

***100,000,000 readers is only 1.6% of the world's population!***

***

[Possible new factoid...not sure if the ratios/figures make sense;
maybe too mathematical or too much confusing dimensional analysis:]

How much shelf space would all of Project Gutenberg's e-texts occupy
if they were physical books? There are about 2,260,000,000 bytes worth
of ASCI texts online. Assuming that each page contains 2,000 bytes,
and 100,000 pages would be 1 meter thick, and the front and back
covers of a book total about 1/2 a centimeter in thickness, calculate:

(4,020 books) x (0.005 meters total cover thickness per book) x
(1 meter thickness per 100,000 pages) x (2,260,000,000 bytes / 2000 bytes
per page) = 227.13 meters of shelf space.


We currently have 58 *reserved* slots, which is why the total number
of titles is not as high as the Etext ####'s might indicate. . .and
we are also working on two sections now, the 4000's and the 4100's

Our Total For The Year Is About 993 For 296 days,
this is 3.35 per day or 101 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1225 For The Year. . . .
We are about 43 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.
