We need your support more than ever. . .donation information follows!

Let me know if you can help us stay in contact with some of the places
where we have been nominated for various cash awards. . .communication
with some of these is sporadic, and we may have lost out on several of
these that would have helped our budget a great deal, simply because a
variety of email glitches kept us out of commication with them.

This week:  James Joyce's Ulysses has been posted as eText #4300!  And
our previous count of 57 reserved etexts has been reduced to 54 with
the posting of three more of Burton's Arabian Nights, #'s 3444-3446!

DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory
B. Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

<http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>
or
<ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

***

Looking for non-English etexts?  Try the "advanced search" feature at:

http://promo.net/cgi-promo/pg/t9.cgi

This allows you to search by language. Currently, there are
etexts in Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch/Flemish, French,
German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Swedish and
Welsh.  And, of course, English; and there are some who would
count the language of DNA/GATC. . .

And very-recently we added our first etext in Greek.

Let's do even more languages. . .

For a list of mirrors (copies) of the Project Gutenberg
collection, view http://promo.net/pg/list.html

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
of North America.  For information about how to set one
up, contact Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

The most recent list we received indicated these were all "life +50"
countries for copyright expiration:

Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize,
Benin, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech
Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Ghana, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan,
(South) Korea, Latvia, Lebanon, Malawi, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Oman, Pakistan, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Qatar, St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia,
and Ukraine.

Works which are in the public domain in Australia and other "Life +50"
countries may remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not
download, or read online, such books if they are in a country where
copyright protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death.
The author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral
rights to oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot
of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary
works of the twentieth century.

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 01/02/02**:  4,292
(This number includes the 34 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

Thru 01/02/01:  52 Weeks (364 days)
                 1,240 total new etexts, yr-to-date.
                 Monthly avg: 103.33
                 Weekly avg:   23.85
                 Daily avg:     3.41

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,240,
this is 3.41 per day or 102.2 Per 30 day month. . . .
We are 52 weeks through the year. . .next week we will
start a new 52 week calendar year of eBook production!

These statistics are calculated based on full weeks of production,
each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting with the first
Wednesday in Jan.  In 2001, Jan 3rd was the first Wednesday, and
Jan 10th was the end of the first week of production.  And on this
basis, etexts announced between Dec 26, 2001 and Jan 2, 2002 will
be counted as the last week of production for 2001.

Five years ago, in Dec 1996, we announced etext #768; this
represented the output for the first 25 years of Project
Gutenberg.  Five years later there are more than 4,250
Project Gutenberg eBooks online.

[In case you wondered who was buying up your telephone company
without much of any real media coverage, it is Southwestern Bell
Corporation, rarely, if ever, mentioned now other than as SBC.
They bought Southwestern Bell, Ameritech, PacificBell, Nevada Bell,
SNET, Cingular, Sterling Commerce, and Prodigy Communications,
as far as I can tell, and are now starting on Yahoo!. . .let's
just hope Google never sells out.]

SBC ACQUIRES STAKE IN YAHOO
SBC Communications, the No. 2 U.S. local telecom operator, is buying a 3%
stake in Yahoo from Softbank America for undisclosed terms. The move comes
on the heels of last month's agreement between the two companies to connect
Yahoo's content with SBC's 3.6 million Internet customers. "This purchase
will strengthen the new SBC and Yahoo relationship, further solidifying the
premier alliance between the nation's leading DSL Internet provider and the
number one global Internet destination," says SBC chairman and CEO Edward
Whitacre. (Financial Times 28 Dec 2001)

YAHOO WINS HOTJOBS AFTER RIVAL BIDDER DROPS OUT
Yahoo has been successful in its attempt to acquire HotJobs, the Internet's
second-largest site devoted to job-seeking. TMP Worldwide, which had agreed
to buy HotJobs six months ago, decided it was not interested in engaging in

["When R&D Bugdets Go, You Can Be Sure All Else Will Follow"]
[Quote from a Zenith employee when Sony killed of their R&D]

U.S. R&D SPENDING TO GROW JUST 3.2% NEXT YEAR
Corporate spending on research and development will grow by just 3.2% in
2002, for a total of about $195 billion, according to research compiled by
Battelle Memorial Institute and R&D Magazine. The growth rate is down from
an estimated 5.4% in 2001 and 10.8% in 2000. Meanwhile, with corporate
spending down, that means that for the first time in years, the government
is expected to increase its R&D spending more than industry next year.
According to Battelle, government R&D expenditures will increase 4.7% to
$75.5 billion next year, up from 1.3% in 2001. (Wall Street Journal 28 Dec
2001)

THE FUTURE OF E-PUBLISHING
Although e-publishing has suffered a series of setbacks this year, Wired
magazine still found plenty of optimism about the future of e-books. Michael
S. Hart of Project Gutenberg, which offers books in electronic form, says:
"In 2002 the number of e-books available for free download on the Net will
pass 20,000 and the number of Net users will start heading towards 1 billion."
Librarian Cynthia Orr, a co-founder of BookBrowser.com, thinks e-publishers
should pay more attention to libraries, and says that if the major
publishers worked with librarians or distributors "to figure out how to let
libraries purchase or license their e-books, and let readers 'check them
out' for free," that would help build "a market that otherwise threatens to
just collapse for lack of interest. Librarians have been careful defenders
of copyright over the years ... and our budgets are far higher than they
realize." And Mark Gross, president of Data Conversion Laboratory, thinks
that the e-publishing has already won a stealth war: ""What people forget is
e-books were going strong before they were called e-books and they went on
to sweep into many aspects of business and publishing. Most of this has gone
unnoticed by the media. Probably because it has been a kind of backdoor
revolution. To cite one example: Print law books are just about gone. People
don't use them in law firms anymore. It's all electronic books or online. A
revolution has occurred, but no one's noticed." (Wired 25 Dec 2001)

[Not to mention that cellphones will be reporting locations in 2002]

THE SURVEILLANCE SOCIETY
In the battle between privacy and security, the events of Sept.
11 may favor security, but the United States was leaning toward
surveillance even before that. Americans now seem more willing
to accept technologies that can be used to track them, as long
as they offer protection. Cameras mounted on traffic lights,
electronic cards that record users' locations, and computerized
financial records are only the tip of the surveillance iceberg.
Law enforcement agencies are taking advantage of tools that
allow them to follow data trails to apprehend criminals and
suspects. Cameras that use face-recognition software are widely
accepted in Britain, where about 1.5 million police surveillance
units are in operation, with more on the way. Researchers are
developing software that can gather information from a wide
variety of disparate sources based on user requests. The level
of protection that society desires raises fears that a giant
surveillance network could be created--one that could erase
personal privacy and public anonymity. However, citizens can
use the same technology to make sure that the government does
not exceed its authority and acts responsibly. (Wired, December 2001)


[Not to mention Disney's totally obvious control of the ABC TV Network]

A TROUBLING TREND
Even as the Internet population continues to surge, there are
fewer channels for Web content to flow through as smaller Internet
firms close up and carriers begin restricting broadcasting
capabilities. Part of the reason for the limited content is
that Internet users are becoming more savvy about where to
find exactly what they need and surfing fewer sites as a result.
But now there is the threat that companies that own both the
infrastructure and content will keep smaller companies and
individuals from publishing on the Web. Stanford professor
Lawrence Lessig warns of corporations such as AOL that will
leverage their ownership of cable lines to favor their own
content. He gives the example of some cable Internet providers
that prevent users from running Web servers and broadcasting
large numbers of video streams.

[Now you know why so many people refuse to enter their
real names when starting up various operating systems,
since those names can never be deleted, even if you do
a complete reinstall. . .they mention Thought Police.]

A WATCH LIST FOR 2002: COPYRIGHTS
In 2001 the entertainment industry tried to staunch the flow
of pirated material over the Internet by suing the Internet
companies over whose networks such copyright infringement took
place. That strategy proved ineffective, so the new target for
2002 will be the pirates--namely, consumers--themselves. "It's
not companies doing this; it's hobbyists in their garage,"
explained Forrester Research analyst Eric Scheirer. "To stop
hobbyists requires a whole new level of copyright enforcement."
Scheirer expects to see entertainment-industry lawsuits aimed
at consumers next year. Meanwhile, the industry is pressuring
computer and consumer electronics manufacturers to enhance their
products with technology that can block consumers from playing
pirated software. Several movie studios are backing a proposal
from Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) that would make such
technologies a requirement.

[Do you really think the government will try to stop Hollywood?]

FEDS PROBE HOLLYWOOD INTERNET MOVIE VENTURES
Two separate ventures by Hollywood studios to offer Web-based
video-on-demand are being investigated by the Justice Department.
Both efforts "may substantially lessen competition or tend to
create a monopoly in the market for video-on-demand services and
related movie products," according to a civil subpoena obtained
by the Wall Street Journal. Competitors are concerned that the
ventures will use their influence to raise fees, or will refuse
to license their films to other digital movie companies. One of
the efforts, MovieFly, includes Sony, Warner, Paramount, MGM,
and Universal; Disney and 20th Century Fox have teamed up for
the second service, Movies.com. Video-on-demand customers can
download movies on set-top boxes or on their computers from the
Internet. The service is expected to boom with a projected surge
in broadband use.

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

     gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
     gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

           subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

           subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

           unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
