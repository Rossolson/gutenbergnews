For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

<http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>
or
<ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

***

Looking for non-English etexts?  Try the "advanced search"
feature at:

http://promo.net/cgi-promo/pg/t9.cgi

This allows you to search by language. Currently, there are
23 French PG texts and 10 in Italian, not to mention many
books from our German Team.

And now, there is 1 in Greek!

Let's do more languages!

***

For a list of mirrors (copies) of the Project Gutenberg
collection, view http://promo.net/pg/list.html

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
of North America.  For information about how to set one
up, contact Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 12/12/01**:  4,201
(This number includes the 30 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

Thru 12/12/01:  49 Weeks & 2 Days (345 days)
                 1,142 total new etexts, yr-to-date.
                 Weekly avg.:  23.31
                 Daily avg:     3.31

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,142 For 345 days,
this is 3.30 per day or 99.30 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1,208 For The Year. . . .
We are about 49 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.

Five years ago, in  Dec 1996, we announced etext #768.
In this issue, we're announcing #4228

***

The most recent list we received indicated these were all "life +50"
countries for copyright expiration:

Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize,
Benin, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech
Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Ghana, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan,
(South) Korea, Latvia, Lebanon, Malawi, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Oman, Pakistan, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Qatar, St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia,
and Ukraine.

Works which are in the public domain in Australia and other "Life +50"
countries may remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not
download, or read online, such books if they are in a country where
copyright protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death.
The author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral
rights to oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot
of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary
works of the twentieth century.

--=={ ETEXT "COST" $$$: }==--

With 4,201 eTexts online as of December 12, it now takes an average of
100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.38 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One
Trillion Dollars] in books.

*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

This "cost" is down from $2.46 when we had 4059 Etexts on November 1.
This "cost" is down from $2.53 when we had 3951 Etexts on October 3.

FIELD TRIPS TO THE LOUVRE, MINUS THE BUS
The Louvre museum, Pages Jaunes (the French Yellow Pages), and the
French Ministry of Education have collaborated on louvre.edu, a Web
site that allows students to take a virtual tour of the museum from
their classroom computers. Over 3,000 works of art and 350 exhibit
halls have been brought online. With louvre.edu, students can learn
not only about artwork, but also how to use the Internet. This is
especially important in a country where only 20 percent of
households have online access. The Web site was created in response
to a mandate from Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to make the Web
accessible to French schools and administrative offices. The site
features a cyberdesk where students can store artwork for easy
reference. The site's appeal is not restricted to art classes:
Teachers of ancient civilizations and languages are supplementing
their material with connections to louvre.edu

GUT CHANGE: E-BOOK RETREAT AT AOL TIME WARNER
This past August, AOL Time Warner books division chairman Laurence
Kirschbaum acknowledged that demand for e-books was a little slow but that
his gut told him things would be all right: "It is taking longer than
expected, but everything in my gut says now is the time to push harder
rather than slow down." But now the company is laying off almost all of the
29 employees in the e-book division. Mr. Kirschbaum says: "At some point
reality sets in and one has to be realistic about how much of an uphill
climb this is going to be. I have been wrong so far -- I have been
overoptimistic from the beginning, so at a certain point you have to
question whether your logic is sound." (New York Times 5 Dec 2001)

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

   gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
   gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

         subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

         subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

         unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
