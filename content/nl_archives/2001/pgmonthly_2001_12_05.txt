PROJECT GUTENBERG MONTHLY NEWSLETTER FOR DECEMBER 5, 2001

Some of the readers of the Weekly Newsletters have mentioned
that the readers of the Monthly Newsletters are missing some
of the articles included there but not here.  As far as _I_
could tell, that was the main reason for the Monthly edition,
to provide all the indexing information, but not the articles.

Project Gutenberg depends on leverage, the leverage of using the Internet
to multiply the efforts of our few thousand volunteers to get that effort
to a few hundred million people.  Your efforts through Project Gutenberg,
simple as though they may appear. . .typing, scanning, proofreading or an
assortment of other pieces required to get eBooks to the masses. . .are a
powerful beacon to people all over the world.

People ask me how I managed to keep working on Project Gutenberg during a
long initial period of 17 years before anyone ever had any response other
than that it was crazy to put Shakespeare in a computer. . .the answer is
that I could see every word I typed being read by 100,000,000 people.

Your work, on your favorite books, is VERY likely to reach 100,000,000 in
today's world, and even more likely in the world of tomorrow.  Recently I
noted in our Newsletter that the world population has reached 6 billion--
meaning that we only had to reach 1.67% of the population to have reached
our target audience of 100,000,000 people.  When Project Gutenberg began,
the population was around 3.678 billion, which meant we would need to get
our eTexts to 2.72% of the population to reach 100,000,000 people and the
percentange we need to reach to achieve our goal of 100,000,000 people is
continuing to drop, and will be closer to 1% than to 2% before population
is recorded at 6.7 billion, probably before we reach 2009.

Thus, even if your work only reaches 1% of the population, you will still
be able to reach 100,000,000 people. . .Wow!  Talk About Leverage!!!!!!!

So. . .think about this while you are creating eBooks for the world. . .a
little effort on your part, perhaps spread out over days, weeks, or, even
months or years, could easily bring advancements in literacy, information
and the general standard of living to ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE.

That, in a nutshell, is the goal of Project Gutenberg.

For the first time, we have produced 1,000 eBooks in a single year, which
means we have to become even better at supporting you, our volunteers.  I
welcome your suggestions and your efforts as to how to accomplish this.

Wishing You The Very Best Of New Years For 2002!

Michael S. Hart
Founder
Project Gutenberg

Col Choat has moved his Project Gutenberg of Australia website
from:  http://au.geocities.com/gutenberg_au/
to:    http://gutenberg.net.au/

Here's more information from Project Gutenberg of Australia:

Project Gutenberg of Australia

Here in Oz we are celebrating the launch of our permanent PG site,
gutenberg.net.au, after being temporarily located at au.geocities.com
for a time.

We have 26 books listed which are in the public domain in Australia so
why not drop in and have a look!  We also have listed all of the PG
etexts (from both the US and Oz sites) which were written by
Australians or which relate (loosely) to Australia.

Books enter the public domain in Australia 50 years after the author's
death, provided they were published during the author's lifetime. For
translations, the same rules apply to the person translating.
Therefore, we only need to be satisfied that the author died at least
50 years ago and that the work was published during his/her
lifetime. Copyright cannot be renewed or revived by subsequent
publication, nor does a copyright held by a person other than the
author have any validity in such cases.

Of course, works which are in the public domain in Australia may
remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not download, or
read online, such books if they are in a country where copyright
protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death. The
author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral
rights to oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot
of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary
works of the twentieth century.

If you require more information or would like to submit an etext,
contact Col Choat at colc@gutenberg.net.au.

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 12/04/01**:  4,161
(This number includes the 27 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

Thru 11/28/01:  48 Weeks & 2 Days (338 days)
                1,103 total new etexts, yr-to-date.
                Weekly avg.:  22.98
                Daily avg:     3.26

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,103 For 338 days,
this is 3.26 per day or 98.04 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1,190 For The Year. . . .
We are about 48 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

  gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
  gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

        subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

        subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

        unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
would like more information about Project Gutenberg, including an easy
search tool to find and read our etexts, visit the Official Web Pages
