Several volunteers are now using teixlite to tag PG books,
but we need a volunteer to write a PG style sheet, either
.css or .xsl, to use with the teixlite.dtd we have.

ETextViewer displays text as a single-page scrolling view with a cursor,
which is useful when used in conjunction with text-to-speech applications.
Main features are the ability to open very large files; automated text
scrolling; full user customisation of the viewing environment (includes
font styles and margins); text reformatting to remove hard returns,
and saving of all user settings.  On start up, ETextViewer will
automatically open the file you were reading at the position where
it was left.  It also allows for setting of up to 5 bookmarks per book
and saves a history of 20 books.

We need someone to write the weekly Newsletters for November. . . .
I'll be on the road. . . .
I can give you a kind of "fill in the blanks" approach to make it easy.
I should be able to do the monthly Newsletters. . . .

***

We need some volunteers who can spend just a minute or two looking
over each of the three or so eTexts we post on the average day....
Just to download them and check to see that nothing went wrong in
final save and upload process.  Some times there will be missing
"hard returns" or there will be trailing spaces on some or all
of the lines, or there won't be the proper end of file marker,
margination, or header entries.  Nothing sophisticated here, we
just want to be able to catch obvious errors, and we can provide
a program we are porting to various operating system to make this
even easier as we go along.  100 Etexts per month is just too much
for any small group of people to do well. . . .

***

Please send in as much copyright research as you can in the next
month, as I plan to be away for November, and don't want to swamp
Greg Newby with more copyright research than is necessary.
