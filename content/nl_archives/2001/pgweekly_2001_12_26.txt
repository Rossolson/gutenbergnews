PROJECT GUTENBERG WEEKLY NEWSLETTER FOR  WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 26, 2001

***4,261 Tree-Friendly Titles Online***

***29 New Listings This Week***

***119 New Listings This Month***

***1,209 New Listings This Year***

Your suggestions are encouraged as to the way we divide years and months.

The first Newsletter of 2001 was 01/03/01, and the next one is 01/02/02.
We have always counted our production from the middle of the week, as we
send out the Newsletters on Wednesdays.  However, since we changed to a
new format including both weekly and monthly Newsletters, we have to set
a format for how to count monthly production, and we need to make sure
that fits well with how we count weekly production.  Of course, this is
all likely to become historical when we produce so many eBooks per day
that we have to send out a daily Newsletter, as well.

However, back to the present for the moment. . .sometimes we will count
52 Wednesdays per year, and sometimes 53. . .since 52 weeks only add up
to 364 days, and thus every 7th year we would get 53 Wednesdays, and we
are not counting leap years, which cause this to happen even more.

This year the 365 days starting from 01/03/01 would end on 01/04/02,
including 01/01/01, and thus we would have 53 weeks counted. . . .

The question is!!!

How would you create a bookkeeping system that handles this best.

Right now the default would be that we counted the 01/03/01
Newsletter as part of the year 2000, since most of that was
produced during December, 2000 [remember, monthly back then],
so we should obviously include 01/02/02 in the year 2001.

But what will we do when we actually have to count 53 weeks?


Happy New Year!!!


Michael

ANYONE WILLING TO HELP TRANSLATE A VERY GREAT SHORT BOOK INTO ITALIAN???

I'm an italian teenager of 17 and I visited your website more and more
times to search some books, but i can't read whole books in English!!
Can you tell me where I can find an italian translation of your
telematic books?  In particular, I'd want to read "Flatland"
by Edwin A. Abbott.  My compliments and greetings to you all.
I hope you'll write me soon. Tommaso Landi ( nlandi@val.it )

DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory
B. Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

<http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>
or
<ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

***

Looking for non-English etexts?  Try the "advanced search" feature at:

http//promo.net/cgi-promo/pg/t9.cgi

This allows you to search by language. Currently, there are
etexts in Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch/Flemish, French,
German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Swedish and
Welsh.  And, of course, English; and there are some who would
count the language of DNA/GATC. . .

And very-recently we added our first etext in Greek.

Let's do even more languages. . .

collection, view http://promo.net/pg/list.html

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
of North America.  For information about how to set one

The most recent list we received indicated these were all "life +50"
countries for copyright expiration:

Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize,
Benin, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech
Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Ghana, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan,
(South) Korea, Latvia, Lebanon, Malawi, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Oman, Pakistan, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Qatar, St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia,
and Ukraine.

Works which are in the public domain in Australia and other "Life +50"
countries may remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not
download, or read online, such books if they are in a country where
copyright protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death.
The author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral
rights to oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot
of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary
works of the twentieth century.

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 12/26/01**:  4,261
(This number includes the 34 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

Thru 12/26/01:  51 Weeks & 3 Days (360 days)
                1,209 total new etexts, yr-to-date.
                Weekly avg.:  23.71
                Daily avg:     3.36

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1209 For 360 days,
this is 3.36 per day or 100.8 Per 30 day month. . . .
We are about 51 weeks through the year. . . .

These statistics are calculated based on full weeks of production,
each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting with the first
Wednesday in Jan.  In 2001, Jan 3rd was the first Wednesday, and
Jan 10th was the end of the first week of production.  And on this
basis, etexts announced between Dec 26, 2001 and Jan 2, 2002 will
be counted as the last production of 2001.

Five years ago, in Dec 1996, we announced etext #768; this
represented the output for the first 25 years of Project
Gutenberg.  Five years later there are more than 4,250
Project Gutenberg eBooks online.

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

    gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
    gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

          subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

          subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

          unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
would like more information about Project Gutenberg, including an easy
search tool to find and read our etexts, visit the Official Web Pages
at http://promo.net/pg

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 12/26/01**:  4,244
(This number includes the 34 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

Thru 12/26/01:  51 Weeks & 3 Days (360 days)
                1,192 total new etexts, yr-to-date.
                Weekly avg.:  23.18
                Daily avg:     3.31

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,192 For 360 days,
this is 3.31 per day or 99.33 Per 30 day month. . . .
We are about 51 weeks through the year. . . .

These statistics are calculated based on full weeks of production,
each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting with the first
Wednesday in Jan.  In 2001, Jan 3rd was the first Wednesday, and
Jan 10th was the end of the first week of production.  And on this
basis, etexts announced between Dec 26, 2001 and Jan 2, 2002 will
be counted as the last production of 2001.

Five years ago, in Dec 1996, we announced etext #768; this
represented the output for the first 25 years of Project
Gutenberg.  Five years later there are more than 4,200 etexts
on line.

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

   gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
   gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

         subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

         subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

         unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
would like more information about Project Gutenberg, including an easy

INTERNET: NOW A MARKET PLACE BUT STILL A MEETING PLACE
Since 1991, when the National Science Foundation opened the Internet to
commercial uses, the Net has obviously changed its character from a "clubby"
meeting place for scientists and other professionals to a fast-paced
marketplace for the masses ... and for mass commerce. Is that good or bad?
Both. Vint Cerf, known as the "Father of the Internet" for his role in
creating the Internet nonproprietary communications protocol TCP/IP, admits
that nonproprietary systems for commercialization are "not consistent with
the spirit in which the Internet was born," but adds: "I'm pragmatic. The
Internet has to pay for itself. Otherwise it wouldn't work anymore." Barbara
Simmons, past president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
says that the Internet "is the last remaining communications medium that
allows the small person to participate. To lose that would be a great
tragedy." (Los Angeles Times 25 Dec 2001)

[If Honest???  . . .  from a Politico?]

FCC CHAIRMAN PREDICTS MORE BIG TELECOM MERGERS
Michael C. Powell, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, says
that more telecom mergers are necessary and inevitable, and that they can be
accomplished without damage to maintenance of a competitive environment: "If
we were honest, we would have to know and admit that network businesses
always drive to size, scope and scale. To realize, at some level, the kind
of extraordinary benefits we keep wanting on a national mass-market scale,
there's bigness involved." And the effect on competition? "There's a big
difference between big and market power or anti-competitive power, but
sometimes we confuse the two... There's going to be an orbit of major global
providers who will garner all the attention, but along their value chain
there will be hundreds of important companies providing pieces of what the
consumer needs." (Financial Times 20 Dec 2001)  http://news.ft.com/ft/

SECURITY FLAW COMPROMISES WINDOWS XP
Windows XP contains several security flaws that could further
stymie sales for the new system, which has sold significantly
less than previous Windows releases despite being billed as the
best version yet. Hackers can remotely commandeer the target
computer, crash it, redirect it to a Web site, or even use it in
a denial-of-service attack. The flaws involve the "universal plug
and play" feature that connects to other devices via the Internet.
Windows Millennium Edition and Windows 98 also share the flaw
when loaded with special Windows XP compatibility software.
Microsoft and security consultants from eEye, the company who
discovered the flaws, have released patches, which are now
available on the Microsoft Web site.

USING E-MAIL TO COUNT CONNECTIONS
Columbia University sociologists are working to create
algorithms that could speed peer-to-peer networks by modeling
them after complex personal connections. Based on the popular
"six degrees of separation" theory developed in the 1960s,
Dr. Duncan Watts plans to prove that everyone on the globe is
connected by six personal connections at most, via e-mail.
Whether or not it is true, Watts said his research will help
scientists understand how people form connections based on
social links, and hopes that the research will also help
computer network developers pioneer new, more efficient
file-sharing systems. Cornell University associate professor
of computer science Jon Kleinberg said the experiment will
help researchers in his field capitalize on the strategies
people use to locate others through personal links.

SENATE PASSES EDUCATION BILL
The Senate voted 87-10 to pass an education reform bill that
would allow parents to prohibit companies from gathering
information about their children at school. The legislation
was originally proposed by Sens. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and
Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) as the Student Privacy Protection Act
last year, but including it in the more comprehensive reform bill
significantly improves its chances of being signed by President
Bush. Companies frequently offer IT equipment and Internet access
to public schools in exchange for the right to monitor students'
usage and collect information about what they view and buy online.
Consumer advocates and parents groups warned that marketers were
exploiting children in this way, and the privacy language seeks
to curtail such practices. The bill would give parents the choice
to opt out of such data collection services. The education
package will also earmark $7 billion for state technology
initiatives, $450 million for math and science partnerships,
and $250 million for school libraries to boost literacy
through technology acquisitions.  (Newsbytes, 18 December 2001)

A CALL TO END COPYRIGHT CONFUSION
Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture Association of America warned
technology firms that if they do not encrypt their digital
content to ensure copy protection, then the federal government
will institute its own standards. Congress may be preparing to
pass the Security Systems Standards and Certification Act (SSSCA)
proposed by Sen. Fritz Hollings (D-S.C.) as early as next year.
The SSSCA requires digital rights management to be incorporated
in any "interactive digital device" and prohibits the creation,
sale, or distribution of any such device that lacks "certified
security technologies" authorized by the Commerce Department.
Free speech proponents such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation
are opposed to the bill, which they claim will choke technology
and act against fair-use rights. However, the Commerce
Department's Bruce Mehlman believes that a government-instituted
digital rights management standard would offer more fair-use
rights than a standard created by the private sector.
