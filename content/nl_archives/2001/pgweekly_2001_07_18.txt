From: Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

Are you a PERL monger, with substantial CGI and HTML experience?
We are working on a turnkey solution that will let volunteers
upload, reformat, check and post etexts.

Development will be on a Solaris 8 computer with PERL 5.6.1 and
Apache.  There are a few programs in place, but essentially this is a
project that will start from scratch.  Components will include:

	. Various upload methods for volunteers to submit etexts
	(e.g., "upload" via HTTP, finding a file delivered by FTP,
	and email)

	. Automatically extracting and decoding MIME components from email
	messages.

	. Reflowing etexts to fill paragraphs and adjust paragraph
	properties (e.g., change indentations to a skipped line).

	. Automatically generating the Project Gutenberg header
	based on input of Author, Title, etc.  Automatic
	assignment of etext #s from a "free list."  (We have
	a program that does this from the Unix command line, but
	it needs to also work via a CGI front-end.)

	. When triggered, finished etexts will be uploaded
	by FTP or sftp to the main distribution sites.

Some additional work may be done with Expect, Python and shell
scripts, but PERL will probably be the right choice for most
of the tasks.

The code we use needs to be well-written, clearly commented,
and reasonably easy to maintain.  We envision having a small
collection of programs that, together, enable substantial
time-savings for our volunteers to get etexts formatted and
posted.

You will work closely with Greg Newby, who maintains the
upload sites currently, to design and implement the programs.

--=={ WEEKLY UPDATE PROGRESS }==--

Since we started sending out weekly newsletters on 4/11/01, we have posted
301 new Etexts; for those 15 newsletters, we have averaged 20.06 Etexts
posted per week; we need to to continue to average 19.23 Etexts per week
in order to publish 1,000 Etexts this year, and another week like this,
and we will have 100 Etexts in four weeks!  So far we have 99, and we
ALMOST had 101, but two more came in needed reformatting that I could
not manage on such short notice. . . .

News. . .My apologies for so much this issue, since I
didn't get any into last week's. . .due to fear of a
crash that never actually seemed to happen, but I was
locked up so much I feared I would not be able to get
anything more done, so I just sent what I had. . .mh


JAILED FOR DEMONSTRATING COPY PROTECTION IS INADEQUATE

  Wired News has a short report on this arrest as well:
http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,45298,00.html

and

Planetebook's story cites Sklyarov's talk at DefCon 9
on e-book security as justification of his arrest.

Vladimir Katalov has informed Planet eBook that Dmitry Sklyarov, author
of the "Advanced eBook Processor", was in fact arrested, and that he is
being held in a Los Vegas prison waiting for subsequent judgement in
Calfornia.
http://www.planetebook.com/mainpage.asp?webpageid=165


and

eBookWeb has a story also about this, written before
the arrest was confirmed, but with additional details.

and

From:  Vladimir Katalov  <vkatalov@elcomsoft.com>

> I've already contacted the people I know in EFF about this event.
> Hopefully they'll take some action (they may find it useful in
> their ongoing effort to get the more extreme provisions of DMCA
> overturned.)

That's Vladimir Katalov speaking. I'm in Portland (Oregon) now;
Alexander (ElcomSoft director) is still in Las Vegas. If anybody can
help us somehow (at least by making all that as public as possible) --
you're welcome!

> - he reports that Sklyarov gave away copies of software at the
> conference, which may be the justification for the arrest, and

Correction: he gave away *demo* versions, which decrypt only 25% of
the documents. We don't sell that software anymore (we stopped sales
almost immediately after first Adobe complaint).

> According to a media representative in the FBI's Las Vegas field office,
> Sklyarov was arrested on a federal warrant issued by the US District
> Court of the Northern District of California, charging him with one
> count of trafficking in software to circumvent copryrightable materials
> and one count of aiding and abbetting such trafficking. He is being held
> at a US Marshalls detention facility in Las Vegas pending his
> extradition to California.

Actually, Dmitry just a programmer/cryptanalyst, but AEBPR is our
corporate product, released under the copyright of our company,
ElcomSoft!!! He would not do anything without our (company)
permission/request, of course.

RANDOM HOUSE SUFFERS SETBACK IN E-BOOK SUIT
Publisher Random House cannot prevent electronic publisher
Rosetta Books from publishing e-book versions of Random House
titles, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday. In the suit it filed
against Rosetta this February, Random House argued that
electronic publishing rights to the eight titles in question,
each a part of Random House's backlist of previously published
titles, were a part of the original publishing contract's
stipulation that the publisher had the right to publish a work
"in book form." However, in turning down Random House's request
for a preliminary injunction, Judge Sidney H. Stein concluded
that e-books are not covered by this stipulation because they are
significantly different from printed books. Rosetta officials say
Stein's decision could be a boon to the fledgling e-book industry,
and legal observers agree that his ruling, if unchallenged, could
establish a precedent for electronic publishing rights.

FREELANCE WIN PUTS LIBRARIANS IN MIDDLE
The librarians who manage the digital archives of major
publications have begun removing freelance articles from their
databases. The recent Supreme Court ruling that requires
publishers to compensate freelance writers for work redistributed
digitally has caused most newspapers and magazines to delete
those articles rather than give the writers additional payment.
Sharon Stewart Reeve, librarian for the San Diego Union-Tribune,
said she and many of her colleagues have mixed emotions over the
verdict. Despite the inconvenience of sorting through 10 years
of archives to mask or delete freelance work, many librarians
sympathize with the writers' small salaries.

WATCHING YOU WATCHING THEM
New tracking technology in cell phones, interactive TVs, and
GPS-enabled rental cars is raising privacy concerns. Already,
several companies are developing software to help track and make
use of data collected from TV set-top boxes. The Center for
Digital Democracy, an advocacy group for consumer privacy, is
currently lobbying for regulations on the use of such technology
that targets ads and gathers personal data. Aware of the possible
government restrictions, the Association for Interactive Media is
trying to outline privacy guidelines for interactive TV operations
such as Microsoft's UltimateTV and the TiVo recorder. Currently,
those companies are outside of cable regulations because they
make use of phone lines. A host of companies are rushing to take
advantage of a FCC deadline for wireless carriers to be able to
pinpoint the location of cell phone users. Besides being able to
locate users in 911-emergency cases, companies will be able to
send location-specific wireless ads to subscribers of wireless
Internet services.

CIVIL LIBERTIES GROUP PLANS EFFORT TO PROTECT NET PARODY
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) this fall intends to
open the "Chilling Effects Clearinghouse," an online repository
of letters sent from lawyers for copyright holders to those
engaged in parodies of those copyrights. Calling such letters
"broad" and "unfounded," EFF legal director Cindy Cohn said the
organization hopes to dissuade corporate attorneys from bullying
the rights of online parodists. Indeed, such a letter spurred
the EFF's action. Lawyers for the children's TV show "Barney"
contacted the EFF, asking it to remove from its archive an
article from the online magazine Computer Underground Digest in
which an author makes negative comments about the singing purple
dinosaur. The EFF, although in the process of removing the
magazine's archive to another site, has taken up the challenge
and contends that the lawyers have misinterpreted the point of
copyright law. Cohn said the author's noncommercial use of
copyrighted material not only fails to violate copyright law,
but is, in fact, protected by it.

LECTURER CHARGED OVER WEB SITE CONTENT
La Trobe University, Australia, has closed a Web site that
attacked Federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge for his
ties to the pharmaceutical industry and charged the site's
administrator, Dr. Ken Harvey, with "serious misconduct." At
issue is an article on the site that refers to Wooldridge as the
"Minister for Pfizer," which the university believes could be a
defamatory statement. However, Harvey, a senior lecturer in the
university's school of public health, said the statement is
"legitimate previously published political comment or satire,
and not defamation." Harvey questions why the university, if so
concerned about the possible liability of the statement, waited
three weeks before taking action.

WHEN IS A BOOK NOT A BOOK? WHEN IT'S AN E-BOOK!
Federal District Judge Sidney H. Stein has ruled that the term "book" in a
book contract does not automatically include the right to offer digital
versions of that same book. Judge Stein therefore denied a request by Random
House to enjoin RosettaBooks from publishing new digital editions of such
Random House authors as Robert B. Parker, Kurt Vonnegut, and William Styron.
The case will now go to full trial, although the judge said that "Random
House is not likely to succeed on the merits of its copyright infringement
claim."

NY TIMES "SOLUTION" NOT WHAT FREELANCE WRITERS HAD IN MIND
A Pyrrhic victory for freelance writers? Maybe. After the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled last week that the New York Times (and two other publishers) had
violated the rights of freelancers by not paying them new compensation for
old material made accessible in electronic databases, the Times decided
simply to remove the disputed material entirely. Characterizing the
newspaper's action as a "complete violation of the spirit of the Supreme
Court decision," the writers are insisting that "there is no need to delete
articles" and are filing a new lawsuit. They say they want their works to
remain in the databases, and merely want to be receive what they consider
appropriate compensation. (New York Times 6 Jul 2001)

MICROSOFT RELENTS ON DESKTOP CONTROL
Admitting "that some provisions in our existing Windows licenses have been
ruled improper by the court," Microsoft says it will now allow PC
manufacturers to change the configuration of the Windows desktop by adding
non-Microsoft products (such as Netscape) and removing Microsoft ones (such
as Internet Explorer). The move may help defuse attempts by competitors or
government officials to block the impending release of XP, the company's new
operating system.

INTERNET FRAUD KEEPS GOING AND GOING
The National Consumer League says that the average loss from Internet fraud
rose from $310 a person in 1999 to $427 last year, when total losses from
Internet fraud reached $3.3 million. New York City's consumer affairs
commissioner Jane Hoffman warns: "Internet fraud runs the gamut from
work-at-home scams to bogus travel and vacation schemes, to securities fraud
and investment scams... For many consumers the Internet can be a virtual
nightmare when it comes to fraud." Hoffman says the five most common
Internet scams are: Web auctions (mainly in the form of goods not delivered
as promised, inflated prices, or fake bids to puff up prices); travel and
vacation schemes with hidden costs; theft of ID numbers, bank data, or
passwords; and investment schemes promising -- but of course failing to
deliver -- huge profits. (AP/Washington Post 15 Jul 2001)

USER AGREEMENTS REQUIRE USER CONSENT
A federal judge in New York has ruled that individuals who downloaded free
software from Netscape's Web site are not bound by a "conditions of use"
statement they hadn't read. The reason? The site had not required them to
take positive action -- prior to the download -- to show they agreed to
Netscape's conditions. A lawyer who represented the plaintiffs against
Netscape praised the court's decision: "It applies an ancient and
fundamental principle in a novel context. That is, you can't be bound to
that which you don't agree to." (New York Times 13 Jul 2001)

CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERAL AGREEMENT: NO HIGH-TECH SURVEILLANCE
Dick Armey, the conservative House Majority Leader, and the left-leaning
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have issued a joint statement
deploring the growing use by law enforcement agencies of high-tech
surveillance tools to monitor ordinary people in public places. Recent news
stories have revealed attempts in Tampa and Virginia Beach to use
face-recognition software to identify passers-by on city streets. An Armey
spokesman calls that trend disturbing, and says that "the American public
doesn't want Big Brother looking over its shoulder." (Newsbytes/USA Today 12
