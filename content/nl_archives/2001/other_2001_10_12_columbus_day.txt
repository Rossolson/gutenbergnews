Happy Columbus Day!

Here are a few new Project Gutenberg Etexts released today
in honor of one of the people who changed the world most.

Of course, in many circles Columbus has recently been
"decanonized". . .just compare the HUGE 400th anniversary
of 1492 as celebrated around the world and especially in
Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the silliness that
transpired on the 500th anniversary when it was decided
well in advance to portray Columbus as politically incorrect.

Columbus, himself, would tell you he was politically incorrect
for his entire life. . .and proud of it. . .and that it was a
requirement. . . .

So. . .Congratulations Columbus!!!

You actually did land on American soil, on several occasions,
much as those who rewrite history would pretend otherwise.

Here are the 9 Columbus Etexts released on October 12, 2001
[The official dates are much later because we are ahead of schedule]
[We ARE planning on fixing this]
