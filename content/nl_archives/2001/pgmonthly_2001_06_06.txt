WARNING:  THIS IS A TEST OF THE NEW PROJECT GUTENBERG NEWSLETTER SERVERS
[This is the first day Newsletters are being sent in this manner, and we
hope to have a majority of any bugs worked out by our July 4th edition.
Please let us know of any suggestions or comments you may have. . . .]
[If you get an extra you didn't get before, or don't see copies in the
usual locations, please let use know!]

Some people have asked that the monthly Newsletter contain ALL of the
information contained in the weekly Newsletters, but I'm not sure this
is going to work out. . .we can certainly include all the listings for
new and revised Etexts. . .but I'm not sure if we can include all the
quotes from Newsscan and Edupage. . .and obviously some of the request
for assistance messages will be out of date if we include them.  Open
to suggestions on this, as well as the entire new formats. . .sorry I
haven't had time to really polish these up yet. . .and I felt I should
strip today's issues down to the bare minimum in case there are errors
that result in you getting extra copies. Michael S. Hart/hart@pobox.com


The Project Gutenberg *Monthly* Newsletter for Wednesday, June 6, 2001

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*


Our first full test of doing the Newsletters with *monthly* listserver
and *weekly* listservers.  Subscription information is included below.

We are still in the process of creating the new Newsletter formats,
so please feel free to make even more suggestions and comments. . .]


With 3600 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $2.78 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.

*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*


This "cost" is down from $2.87 when we had 3481 Etexts on May 2
This "cost" is down from $2.94 when we had 3400 Etexts on April 4
[This was the month we released two full Newsletters at one time]

This "cost" is down from $3.10 when we had 3225 Etexts on March 7

This "cost" is down from $3.40 when we had 2870 Etexts on October 18/Nov 1
This "cost" is down from $3.48 when we had 2870 Etexts on September 3
This "cost" is down from $3.55 when we had 2820 Etexts on August 16

This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July

This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts in April

Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by $1.12. . .
Just from one spring to the next spring???

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02
or
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.


Here is a list of the Etexts posted in the past five weeks:

[Please note the filenames first posted for these two had the wrong numbers.]

Dec 2002 Memoirs of Napoleon, V9, by Bourrienne     [NB#09][nb09vxxx.xxx]3559

and

Correction:
Nov 2002 Human Genome Project, Chromosome Number 09        [09hgpxxa.xxx]3509
The above was previously listed incorrectly as 19hgp. . .

Nov 2002 Human Genome Project, Chromosome Number 09        [19hgpxxa.xxx]3509
and thus I missed unzipping 09hgp10a, which I have also corrected.

Here are the listings for our improved editions of previous releases:

Requests For Assistance

Would the people, who had sent corrections personally to Alev Akman in
the last week, or so, send them again, please? As a result of a computer
crush, she may have lost them and would like to receive them again.

***

If you sent in a file you don't see here, or sent in a revision, or xeroxes
for our copyright research, and haven't heard from me let me know.  Most of
these should only take a few days.

About the Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]

and now

About the Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately at noon each Wednesday, but various
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]


***

I've closed down gutnberg (it responds with a message giving
instructions on gweekly and gmonthly if anyone tries to subscribe),
and populated gweekly and gmonthly with all the subscribers.

I will send out info to both lists on how to unsubscribe etc.

Here are the new instructions you asked for:

-------- mailinglist-howto.txt

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.  

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

  gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
  gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

	subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

	subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

	unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
would like more information about Project Gutenberg, including an easy
search tool to find and read our etexts, visit the Official Web Pages
