In Memoriam:

A day after our last Newsletter, Julia Osterle, who did amazing
work to get Project Gutenberg registered in all 50 states, died
of advanced cancer, which she had held off for longer than most
of our volunteers have been with us.  We owe her greatly and we
miss her even more. . . .  May She Rest In Peace. . . .

Australia

We now have eight books posted at Project Gutenberg of Australia,

legally, how to get them. . .but I am working on it.  Hence
these four are NOT listed in our index as of yet. . .more below.

North Dakota!!!  Don't we have ANYone there???

And now, here is our first Newsletter from:


PROJECT GUTENBERG OF AUSTRALIA

PG of Oz is up and running for posting of etexts which are "in the public
domain" in Australia. Under Australian copyright law literary and dramatic
works published and offered for sale in an author's lifetime are protected for
the life of the author plus fifty years from the end of the year of the
author's death. The work need not have been published in Australia. This means
that the works of many authors are now in the public domain in Australia and
in any other country which embraces the "plus fifty" principle. Copyright
cannot be renewed or revived by subsequent publication, nor does a copyright
held by a person other than the author have any validity in such cases. The PG
of Oz site is presently at http://au.geocities.com/gutenberg_au/ (watch the
underscore in gutenberg_au). So far, we have the following titles:-

1   0100011.txt Animal Farm                        Orwell        George
2   0100021.txt Nineteen eighty-four               Orwell        George
3   0100031.txt When the World Screamed            Doyle         Sir Arthur C
4   0100041.txt Under the Northern Lights          Sullivan      Alan

Next is The Fortunes of Richard Mahony (trilogy) by H H Richardson...
5   0100051.txt Australia Felix                    Richardson    Henry Handel
6   0100061.txt The Way Home                       Richardson    Henry Handel
7   0100071.txt Ultima Thule                       Richardson    Henry Handel

8   0100081.txt Here's Luck                        Lower         Lennie

We already have a few earlier works by Richardson on the main PG site. If
works are eligible to be posted to the main site we will always do that. I am
sure that there are many of you out there who have considered creating etexts
from particular works only to find that they were ineligible for acceptance by
PG. Now is the time to take another look at them to see if they can be posted
on our Oz site.

*** Progress Chart ***

This is NOT counting the Etexts recently posted on the Project Gutenberg of
Australia site[s]. . .which will be added in a week or two, as we figure up
the ways to include them in our listings, depending on which ones are legal
to post on our US sites.  If we had counted those, we would already be past
100 Etexts for August, even with another week to go.

Our Total For The Year Is About 741 For 234 days,
this is 3.16 per day or 95 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1160 For The Year. . . .
We are about 34 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.

***News Headlines From Newsscan and Edupage***

HP UNVEILS FIRST DVD+RW DRIVE
Hewlett-Packard next month will debut the first commercially available DVD
drive for PCs that allows users record a movie, watch it on a typical home
DVD player, and then erase and record again on the same disc. The
DVD-writer dvd100i will carry a price tag of $599, and PC and electronics
makers are hoping the new product will jumpstart holiday sales as consumers
seek out the latest gadgetry to complement their home entertainment
centers. Dataquest estimates that 2.1 million DVD rewritable drives will
ship by the end of next year, and that by 2005, that number will reach 14.3
million drives. In addition to HP's backing, the DVD+RW format has the
support of Dell, Sony, Philips Electronics, Mitsubishi, Ricoh, Thomson
Multimedia and Yamaha. (ZDNet News 20 Aug 2001)

E-BOOKS MAY SAVE STUDENTS' ACHING BACKS
Responding to worries that students in Texas are carrying too
many weighty textbooks, the state is increasing the use of
electronic textbooks and broadening the curriculum to include
digital media. The state has earmarked $1.8 million to be spent
on e-books over six years. E-books are also handy "for courses
in which the information changes rapidly, for example history,"
noted Charles Mayo of the Texas Education Agency. In September,
the state legislature will release the results of a $1.3 million
e-book effectiveness analysis. Some people criticize that viewing
books on computer screens for prolonged periods of time is
unhealthy for kids and that electronic textbook technology is
not available for lower-income school districts.

[And how many of us are happy with even licensing a bike or dog?]

LICENSE WEB USERS? IT'S A THOUGHT
An increasing number of security experts say the Internet would
be a much safer place if consumers had the basic computer skills
to protect themselves. Some have begun to float the idea that
computer users should be required to obtain licenses. Richard
Forno, co-author of the security book "Incident Response," said
this argument would lead to licenses for usage of household
appliances next, because mishaps also occur when people use
power tools or items such as barbeque grills. Rob Rosenberger
of vMyths, a virus information Web site, said that a global
licensing body would be needed if there is to be formal
policing for the Internet.

[What a waste of bandwidth!]

HOLLYWOOD, AN EYE ON PIRACY, PLANS MOVIES FOR A FEE ONLINE
Five movie studios have teamed up to develop a video-on-demand
service that allows users essentially to rent movies online.
"This announcement confirms that film producers are eager for
the Internet to enlarge and flourish," declared Jack Valenti,
president of the Motion Picture Association of America. For a
fee, consumers with high-speed connections will be able to
download films. The studios involved--Sony Pictures, MGM, Warner
Brothers, Paramount, and Universal--are hoping that the service
will be adequately secure against digital piracy. The downloaded
films will be programmed to stay on consumer hard drives for 30
days but erase themselves 24 hours after the first viewing.
Video-on-demand will initially be available on Web-enabled TVs
and PCs, but is expected to branch out into cable TV and other
media.  (New York Times, 17 August 2001)


"WEB BUGS" TRACK INTERNET USE
A new Cyveillance report finds that "Web bugs"--invisible
technology that gathers information on Web site visitors--are
embedded in 18 percent of personal Web pages, compared to less
than 0.5 percent in 1998. Companies such as America Online and
Yahoo!'s Geocities include Web bugs in the Web page-building
technology they offer free to users. Spokesmen for Web bug
distributors claim that the technology is not in any way used to
collect personally identifiable data on visitors, but privacy
proponents are concerned, especially when consumers are unaware
that their personal pages host Web bugs. Yahoo! does not mention
the fact that Web bugs are placed on personal pages, and AOL
fails to describe their use. "It's extremely troubling--the
technology should not be used to collect information in such a
covert way," argued PricewaterhouseCoopers' Scott Charney.
