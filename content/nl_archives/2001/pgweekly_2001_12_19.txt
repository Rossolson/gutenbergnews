PROJECT GUTENBERG WEEKLY NEWSLETTER FOR  WEDNESDAY, BDECEMBER 19, 2001

LOTS of new information. . .so this is ALSO going to the monthly list.

Because EIGHT more eBooks came in while I was preparing to send this,
AND because large amounts of additional donation possibilities came in,
I am a little late in sending this out, and my calculations might be a
bit shaky, as I had to change the totals and other items over and over
during the process.

FROM MICHAEL HART, DIRECTOR OF PROJECT GUTENBERG:

I have been encouraged by some of our volunteers to say a
few words in each Newsletter, but I have previously been
trying to keep my own personal views out of any Project
Gutenberg materials.

In a small effort to give something to both sides:

Here is a short file from when Project Gutenberg had only
a small handful of titles, this one was never numbered or
listed in our index. . .perhaps if we collected up more.

THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
(A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS)

by Clement Clarke Moore

THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION, 1988


'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that ST. NICHOLAS soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;
"Now, DASHER! now, DANCER! now, PRANCER and VIXEN!
On, COMET! on CUPID! on, DONDER and BLITZEN!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
"HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT."



JEST 'FORE CHRISTMAS

by Eugene Field

THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION, 1988


Father calls me William, sister calls me Will,
Mother calls me Willie, but the fellers call me Bill!
Mighty glad I ain't a girl -- ruther be a boy,
Without them sashes, curls, an' things that's worn by Fauntleroy!
Love to chawnk green apples an' go swimmin' in the lake --
Hate to take the castor-ile they give for belly-ache!
'Most all the time the whole year round, there ain't no flies on me,
But jest 'fore Christmas, I'm as good as I kin be!

Got yeller dog named Sport, sick him on the cat;
First thing she knows she doesn't know where she is at!
Got a clipper sled, an' when us kids goes out to slide,
'Long comes the grocery cart, an' we all hook a ride!
But sometimes when the grocery man is worrited an' cross,
He reaches at us with his whip, an' larrups up his hoss,
An' then I laff an' holler, "Oh, ye never teched ME!"
But jest 'fore Christmas, I'm as good as I kin be!

Gran'ma says she hopes that when I git to be a man,
I'll be a missionarer like her oldest brother, Dan,
As was et up by the cannibuls that lives in Ceylon's Isle,
Where every prospeck pleases, an' only man is vile!
But gran'ma she has never been to see a Wild West show,
Nor read the Life of Daniel Boone, or else I guess she'd know
That Buff'lo Bill and cowboys is good enough for me!
EXCEP' jest 'fore Christmas, when I'm as good as I kin be!

And then old Sport he hangs around, so solemn-like an' still,
His eyes they keep a-sayin':  "What;s the matter, little Bill?"
The old cat sneaks down off her perch an' wonders what's become
Of them two enemies of hern that used to make things hum!
But I am perlite an' 'tend so earnestly to biz,
That mother says to father: "How improved our Willie is!"
But father, havin' been a boy hisself, suspicions me
When, jest 'fore Christmas, I'm as good as I kin be!

For Christmas, with its lots an' lots of candies, cakes, an' toys,
Was made, they say, for proper kids an' not for naughty boys;
So wash yer face an' brush yer hair, an' mind yer p's an' q's,
An' don't bust out yer pantaloons, an' don't wear out yer shoes;
Say :Yessum" to the ladies, an' "Yessur" to the men,
An' when they's company, don't pass yer plate for pie again;
But, thinkin' of the things yer'd like to see upon that tree,
Jest 'fore Christmas be as good as yer kin be!

THANKS to everyone who has sent a donation.  Please think of
us for your holiday and end-of-year giving.

Here is all the new information, some reducancy,
as this just came in, and I am just pasting it in here:

HOW TO MAKE A DONATION TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available.  Visit
http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or email the PGLAF's chief executive
officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory B. Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

There are several ways to donate.  We want you to make a donation in
the best way for you, so have tried to make it easy.

In summary, we can accept checks or money orders in any national
currency, wire transfer or electronic funds transfer, and credit
cards.

If you want to make a donation in a way that's not specified below,
please contact us!


1. Send a check or money order in US funds.
Our address is listed above:


2. Send a check or money order in non-US funds.  This can go to the
same address as in #1 above.  The bank sends non-US funds for
"collection" and a fee is charged.  This fee is difficult to know in
advance, but usually seems to be a few dollars.  The exchange rate to
US funds is at market value.

3. Use NetworkForGood.  This is a Web site that accepts credit card
donations and does not charge overhead.  Donation is simple, similar
to most online purchase transactions.  A credit card with a mailing
address in the US is required.

The URL to donate is:

http://www.guidestar.org/partners/networkforgood/donate.jsp?ein=64-6221541

Your name, mailing address and email address are required, as well as
your credit card information.  You can choose to prevent sending your
personal data to PGLAF (also see our Privacy Policy, below).  Your
credit card information is NEVER sent to PGLAF.

On the donation form, you can specify a designation for a specific
purpose.  Although PGLAF will receive these specifications, all
donations to PGLAF go to general operating funds.

Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover are accepted.
NetworkForGood covers the normal transaction fees (up to about $2.50
per transaction) and credit card overhead (usually about 2% per
transaction), so 100% of your intended donation amount goes to PGLAF.

Your credit card statement will show "Network For Good" as the payee,
but 100% will go to PGLAF by electronic funds transfer to our bank
account.


4. Use PayPal.  PayPal is a Web site that accepts credit card and bank
transfer payments.  You need to set up a PayPal account to donate via
PayPal.  This requires providing credit card and/or bank information.
Visa and MasterCard are accepted.

Visit http://www.paypal.com

To make a donation to PGLAF, login to your PayPal account and select
"Send Money."  When prompted, specify "donate@gutenberg.net" as the
recipient, and you will be presented with PGLAF's information.  Send
the payment as you would any other payment.

Funds go directly to PGLAF via PayPal.

The fee charged by PayPal for payments is 2.9% of the transaction plus
30 cents per transaction.  (For a $100 payment, this amounts to $3.20
or 3.2%.  For $10, the fee is $0.59 or 5.9%).

PayPal accepts non-US accounts and funds.


5. Wire transfer.  There is a fixed fee of $15 to accept a wire
transfer to our bank account, which must be in US funds.  For medium
and large donations, this may be more efficient than some other
methods.  Email gbnewby@ils.unc.edu if you would like to set up a wire
transfer.



PRIVACY POLICY FOR DONATIONS

In order to meet IRS tax regulations, PGLAF keeps track of the names,
addresses, donation amounts and donation methods of non-anonymous
donors.  We normally send a postal or email "thank you" letter when we
receive your donation.

We do not provide any information about donors to any party outside of
PGLAF and its employees for any purpose, except as required by law.

We will not send subsequent postal or electronic mail or attempt to
phone you.  If you would like to subscribe to one of the Project
Gutenberg email lists, to receive the monthly or weekly newsletter,
please visit http://www.gutenberg.net for instructions.


Most recent update: December 19, 2001

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

<http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>
or
<ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

***

Looking for non-English etexts?  Try the "advanced search"
feature at:

http://promo.net/cgi-promo/pg/t9.cgi

This allows you to search by language. Currently, there are
etexts in German, French, Italian, Bulgarian, Flemish/Dutch,
Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, and Welsh, plus a
version of the Bible in Swedish.

And very-recently we added our first etext in Greek.

Let's do even more than the hundred eBooks we have
presented in 17 languages.

collection, view http://promo.net/pg/list.html

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
of North America.  For information about how to set one
up, contact Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

The most recent list we received indicated these were all "life +50"
countries for copyright expiration:

Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize,
Benin, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech
Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Ghana, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan,
(South) Korea, Latvia, Lebanon, Malawi, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Oman, Pakistan, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Qatar, St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia,
and Ukraine.

Works which are in the public domain in Australia and other "Life +50"
countries may remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not
download, or read online, such books if they are in a country where
copyright protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death.
The author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral
rights to oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot
of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary
works of the twentieth century.

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 12/19/01**:  4,224
(This number includes the 34 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

Thru 12/19/01:  50 Weeks & 2 Days (352 days)
                 1,175 total new etexts, yr-to-date.
                 Weekly avg.:  23.44
                 Daily avg:     3.32

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,172 For 352 days,
this is 3.33 per day or 99.89 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1,215 For The Year. . . .
We are about 50 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.
The 26th would be our last Newsletter, so I
am wondering if we missed counting a week.
52 x 7 = 364. . .so should always be 52 Wednesdays.

Five years ago, in Dec 1996, we announced etext #768; this
represented the output for the first 25 years of Project
Gutenberg.  Five years later there are more than 4,200 etexts
on line.

[Are Copyright Royalties Only Paid By The "Have-Nots???]

GROUPS REACH TENTATIVE DEAL ON WEBCAST ROYALTIES
Attorneys representing radio broadcasters, record labels and music artists
have signed a tentative settlement in an ongoing dispute over whether radio
broadcasters owe additional royalty payments when they put their stations'
programming online. If the deal is finalized, it could be an important step
toward resolving the tangle of legal issues surrounding online music. Radio
companies currently do not pay recording firms royalties on songs they
broadcast over the airwaves and have argued that the exemption should apply
to online "Webcasts" as well. That issue is now on appeal. The current
agreement depends on the U.S. Copyright Office to support arbitration to
resolve the question of a royalty rate to be paid by Internet-only
Webcasters who offer music online but don't own any radio stations.

HEWLETT URGES HP AND COMPAQ TO CALL OFF MERGER
Walter Hewlett, son of Hewlett-Packard co-founder William Hewlett, has sent
a letter to the boards of both HP and Compaq, urging them to call off their
$22.8-billion merger. "There is enormous unhappiness out there about this
transaction. This unhappiness goes far beyond those shareholders and
analysts that have spoken out publicly," said Hewlett in his letter. He
warned that by pushing ahead, HP and Compaq both would suffer "serious and
increasing adverse consequences^E Value is being lost here by both companies
with each day that passes. The market clearly agrees." Compaq's board on
Thursday said it strongly disagrees with Hewlett's conclusions and believes
that the merger would create long-term shareholder value. Meanwhile, HP
officials have suggested that Hewlett's opposition to the deal places him
in a conflict-of-interest position, and that he should consider resigning
from the HP board. (Financial Times 13 Dec 2001)

CONGRESS HAS LOW INTEREST IN CONSTITUENT (E-)MAIL
A test by a New York Times reporter found that e-mail sent to Congressional
offices is unlikely to be read. After sending messages to 65 Senate offices
identifying herself as a reporter for the Times doing a story on e-mail
message-handling by members of Congress, she received only 27 automated
response and 7 other responses within two weeks. One of seven full
responses was from Larry Neal, the deputy chief of staff for Senator Phil
Gramm of Texas, who explained: "The communication that Sen. Gramm values
most certainly does not arrive by wire. It is the one where someone sat
down at a kitchen table, got a sheet of lined paper and a No. 2 pencil, and
poured their heart into a letter." (New York Times 13 Dec 2001)

RELEASE OF RUSSIAN PROGRAMMER
Dmitry Sklyarov, the 27-year-old Russian programmer arrested in the U.S.
for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by writing and
promoting code that could be used to evade the copy-protection features of
the Adobe Acrobat eBook Reader, is being released, but the U.S. government
will continue its prosecution of his employer, ElcomSoft of Moscow.
Skylarov's cause was embraced by a worldwide collection of programmers,
scientists, free-speech advocates and civil libertarians who organized
"Free Dmitry" rallies. (San Jose Mercury News 14 Dec 2001)

LINGUIST SAYS: RELAX ABOUT NETSPEAK
In his new book "Language and the Internet," Welsh linguist David Crystal
welcomes the way the Internet "shows language expanding richly in all sorts
of directions," including instant-message-abbreviations ("RUOK" for "Are
you okay?") and iconic abbreviations such as :) and its frowning, winking,
and various other cousins. "A whole new medium of communication does not
arrive very often in the history of the race. The Internet is a genuine
third medium of communication," which will in the future "probably be the
main way we humans communicate." He urges the language purists to relax,
let language develop naturally, and avoid being "depressingly
prescriptive." "If I leave out the punctuation in an e-mail, you don't say,
'Crystal doesn't know his grammar.' You say, 'Crystal's in a hurry.'" He
predicts that the conventions of Internet use will emerge on their own:
"We'll learn gradually what works and what doesn't, just as we've already
learned that if we type out a whole sentence in capital letters, it upsets
people." (New York Times 13 Dec 2001)

DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING FINDS LARGEST PRIME
A 20-year-old Canadian man has identified the world's largest prime number
using a desktop computer linked to a 210,000-machine quasi-supercomputer
distributed around the globe. Michael Cameron, a participant in the Great
Internet Mersenne Prime Search that uses the PrimeNet network system to
perform calculations, announced his discovery that "2 to the 13,466,917th
power minus 1" is the largest prime number. (Mersenne primes are named
after Marin Mersenne, a French monk born in 1588 who investigated a
particular type of prime number: 2 to the power of "p" minus one, in which
"p" is an ordinary prime number.) The concept of distributed computing is
not limited to the academic world. Companies such as Intel and Sun
Microsystems use it for designing microprocessors, and the idea is closely
linked to "grid" computing, which unites computers and storage systems into
a single pool of resources. (CNet News.com 13 Dec 2001)

[Remember What I've Been Saying About Pay-Per-View???]

CABLE LOOKS TO VOD FOR NEW REVENUE
Cable TV systems are set to turn up the volume on video-on-demand in 2002,
as they seek to boost profits while taking advantage of their
multi-billion-dollar investment in digital TV upgrades. "How many people
are interested in the couple of hundred extra channels (available on
digital cable)? They need something to drive digital, and that's going to
be VOD," says an analyst at CIBC Markets. Charter Communications is
currently the leader in rolling out VOD, offering the service in 12 markets
to approximately one-third of its 6.9 million customers. Charter's early
marketing studies show that, in addition to boosting demand for digital
services, VOD reduces churn -- the number of subscribers who drop the
service. "It's a real differentiator for us," says Charter VP Jim
Henderson. "It's not something that satellite (TV) can easily offer."
Analysts say cable's efforts to lure VOD subscribers could be a
double-edged sword. Cable firms have enough bandwidth and servers to
accommodate 10% of their subscribers ordering VOD at the same time, and a
surge in VOD demand would overwhelm cable network capacity. Cable's real
problem, however, remains access to content -- Hollywood studios are
demanding 60% of VOD revenue, as opposed to the traditional 50-50 split for
pay-per-view movies. So far, cable firms have struck deals with only Sony's
Columbia TriStar and Vivendi's Universal Pictures, although No. 2 cable
operator AOL Time Warner can count on its own stable of HBO programming and
other content for its planned subscription VOD service.

FREE CELL PHONE MINUTES DWINDLING
Free minutes -- one of the perks that's successfully enticed many people to
sign up for cell phone service -- are slowly being phased out, as carriers
look for ways to ease network congestion and introduce consistency to their
nationwide calling plans. Sprint PCS recently became the latest carrier to
shift the start time for its night calling period to 9 p.m. from 8 p.m.,
following similar moves in many markets by Cingular Wireless and Verizon
Wireless. The number of U.S. cell phone subscribers is nearly 130 million,
almost double the level three years ago, and companies say their success in
attracting users is also overloading their network capacity, causing more
dropped calls and busy signals. By moving the start of off-peak calling
back an hour, they're better able to keep residential and business traffic
from overlapping. (USA Today 11 Dec 2001)

CONGRESS FACES DEFINING ISSUE OVER COPYRIGHT LAW
Interactive Web radio stations may be granted the same licenses
other radio stations have if proposed changes to the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act are accepted by Congress. A House
Judiciary Committee will review the proposal, which the
Recording Industry Association of America opposes. Current law
limits the type of radio broadcasts that recording studios must
offer licenses to, and the Web broadcasters in the Digital Media
Association want to broaden that definition. Metrics firm
MeasureCast said the number of people listening to Internet
radio in October tripled since January, and Jupiter Media Metrix
has said 30 million consumers will have bought music online this year.

A WIN-WIN SITUATION DOWN AT THE LAB
Media Lab Europe (MLE), the counterpart of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Media Lab, has set up its own
venture capital arm to help distribute the benefits of
research evenly between inventors and corporate sponsors.
Companies provide the cash for the new Media Lab Ventures
group and share in the rewards. But, by providing open access
to funds, researchers have more freedom in their projects and
do not feel they must shield research that could potentially
be the base of their own startup company. As a result, MLE
chief executive Rudolf Burger expects more licenses to come
from the laboratory and fewer spinoffs that drain talent. MLE
was launched in 2000 by Nicholas Negroponte, who also set up
the U.S. Media Lab. He set up shop in Dublin, in return for
a $32 million grant from the Irish government, which is eager
to bolster foreign investment.  (Financial Times, 17 December 2001)

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

   gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
   gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

         subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

         subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

         unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
