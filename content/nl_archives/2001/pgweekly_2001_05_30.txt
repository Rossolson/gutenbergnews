have already posted all the files listed in that index
listing we include in the Newsletters [excepting those
marked as "reserved," of course.

While our human cataloguers and indexers of course can
not had time to add them to their files yet, computers
will already have them listed. . .and thus you will be
able to download them, literally only one second after
we have started to post them, even before our own post
of them has been completely uploaded. . . !

Requests For Assistance

Would the people, who had sent corrections personally to Alev Akman in
the last week, or so, send them again, please? As a result of a computer
crush, she may have lost them and would like to receive them again.

Index Listings and Comments for Improved Files


Correction:
Nov 2002 Human Genome Project, Chromosome Number 09        [09hgpxxa.xxx]3509
The above was previously listed incorrectly as 19hgp. . .
Nov 2002 Human Genome Project, Chromosome Number 09        [19hgpxxa.xxx]3509
and thus I missed unzipping 09hgp10a, which I have also corrected.


Index Listings and Comments for the New Files


We have a total of 19 new files for you to download this week.
This would yield a total of 988 Etexts per year.  So far we are
averaging a few under 19.25 per week, which is what we would need
to do 1,000 books this year, but we did have that one great month
in which we did 137, so we might just make it. . . .

Here are the listings for our improved editions of previous releases:
