I would like to dedicate this Newsletter to my brother, whom I thought
we had lost for most of yesterday, but who finally managed to get thru
at dinnertime last night. . .it was so good to hear his voice.  He was
meeting with Pentagon officials yesterday morning, but they decided to
meet him halfway between their respective offices.  The old office was
one of those that was remodeled. . .and now destroyed. . . .

I wish I could say that all my tears of the past 24 hours were just an
effect of allergies. . .some were. . .some weren't. . . .

My thanks to those who remembered that my brother and mother often eat
lunch at Pentagon City, etc.

I didn't answer any but the most important emails yesterday and didn't
put any books on line. . .I was just about to when it all started.

So, I will probably be behind with my email for a few days, as I spent
this entire day mostly posting a HUGE number of books. . .over half of
the list below. . .because that's the way some of us are. . .we do the
work even more in times of stress. . .and I thank those others who did
so much to help, but with the work and with the heart.

Please email me again in a few days if I haven't answered. . . .

Special thanks to David Widger, Alev Akman, Greg Newby and my cousins.

I should also mention that Brett Fishburne, our newest FTP person is a
member of FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] and this will not
be available to put our books on site for some time.  If anyone should
like to do this for us, please let me know.

Thanks!!!

Michael

We need some volunteers who can spend just a minute or two looking
over each of the three or so eTexts we post on the average day....
Just to download them and check to see that nothing went wrong in
final save and upload process.  Some times there will be missing
"hard returns" or there will be trailing spaces on some or all
of the lines, or there won't be the proper end of file marker,
margination, or header entries.

***News Headlines From Newsscan and Edupage***

FOUR PUBLISHERS TO SELL E-BOOKS THROUGH YAHOO
Four major publishers (Simon & Schuster, Random House, Penguin Putnam, and
HarperCollins) will sell their digital books on an Internet through the
Yahoo.com site, an arrangement which Yahoo executive Rob Solomon suggests
is attractive to the publishers because Yahoo has a "neutral status, like
Switzerland, and is not part of a major media company." For its services,
Yahoo will receive sales commissions and book promotion fees. The book
division of AOL Time Warner is the only top publishing companies that has
declined to participate in the deal; that division's chairman, Laurence
Kirschbaum, said: "Given the fact that sales of electronic books are not
running away, we have to question whether we need to expand right now. Our
focus right now is on AOL." (New York Times 5 Sep 2001)

DUELING ESSAY CONTESTS IN FRAY INVOLVING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is hosting
a contest that offers a prize of $600 for the best essay that
answers the question, "What does intellectual property mean to
you in your daily life?" Last week, an organization of academics,
artists, and proponents called Wipout announced a contest that
asks participants to answer the same question, but with a more
critical eye. Wipout's members oppose the extensive intellectual
property protection that WIPO favors, calling such measures
detrimental to the public. Patent laws, for instance, could
hinder access to AIDS drugs in South Africa, according to the
Treatment Action Campaign, one of Wipout's supporters. It
has yet to be seen if WIPO will sue Wipout's self-described
"intellectual property counter-essay contest" for copyright
infringement.  (New York Times, 10 September 2001)

DOWNLOADS SWAMP COMPUTER NETWORK IN U. OF DELAWARE'S DORMS
Officials at the University of Delaware believe that students
downloading movies were responsible for the heavy traffic that
brought Internet access in the school's residential halls to a
halt this week. Although the institution initially opted to try
to educate students about good Internet conduct rather than impose
bandwidth restrictions, starting next week that will no longer
be the case. The problem was caused by students downloading as
much as 19 gigabytes of material, according to the university's
VP for information technologies, Susan J. Foster. Such bandwidth
suggests that they were probably downloading video. Consequently,
downloads will now be limited to one gigabyte per student per day.
