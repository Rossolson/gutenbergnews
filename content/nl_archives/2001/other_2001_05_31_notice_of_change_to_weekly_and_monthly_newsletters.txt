Gutnberg subscribers:

As mentioned by Michael Hart recently, the "gutnberg" list
has been closed.

Instead, there are two new mailing lists, "gweekly" and
"gmonthly"

At Michael's request, I have subscribed everyone who was
subscribed to "gutnberg" to BOTH "gweekly" and "gmonthly",
which is why you are getting this message.

Most people will probably want to unsubscribe from one
of the lists.  At the bottom of this message (and my
next message, to gmontly), you will find unsubscribe
instructions.  I will include more detailed instructions
and mailing list information in a message to "gmontly",
as well.

Sorry for the work involved in unsubscribing from one
of the lists, but it seemed easier than asking everyone
to re-subscribe themselves to one of the new lists.

Both gmonthly and gweekly will get newsletters from
Project Gutenberg about the  most recent etexts and other
news, events, and calls for volunteers.  The gweekly will
go out weekly, and so will be a somewhat quicker way to
find out about newly posted etexts.  Otherwise, the content
will be similar, and since both lists are moderated you will
not get a whole lot of messages.

** If you have opinions or comments about this change, please email 
** Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com> directly.  I'm just helping
** with setting up the mailing lists.  If you have technical
** problems, email me: Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg!
