Who really owns AEBPR Copyright?
In the U. S. District Court criminal complaint that led to the recent
arrest of Dmitry Sklyarov, a special agent for the FBI made several
references to copyright ownership of the controversial eBook decrypting
software. Sklyarov, an employee of ElcomSoft Ltd., appears to have been
singled out for arrest -- several other ElcomSoft employees were also in
the U.S. at the same Las Vegas conference -- at least in part because
Adobe Systems investigators identified him to the FBI as being the
copyright owner for the company's Advanced eBook Processor software. But
a closer look reveals that may not be true.

Thought you guys might wannt to see the interview with Dmitri. One of
the local Las Vegas stations managed to get an exclusive.

This is from the Electronic Frontier Foundation Media Release
"Adobe, Electronic Frontier Foundation Call for Release
of Russian Programmer
"For Immediate Release: July 23, 2001


"San Jose, Calif. - Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq: ADBE) and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) today jointly recommend the
release of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov from federal custody.

"Adobe is also withdrawing its support for the criminal complaint
against Dmitry Sklyarov.

...

" 'We strongly support the DMCA and the enforcement of copyright
protection of digital content,' said Colleen Pouliot, Senior Vice
President and General Counsel for Adobe. 'However, the prosecution of
this individual in this particular case is not conducive to the best
interests of any of the parties involved or the industry. ElcomSoft's
Advanced eBook Processor software is no longer available in the
United States, and from that perspective the DMCA worked. Adobe will
continue to protect its copyright interests and those of its
customers.' "


and now to our normal headlines. . . .


ADOBE CHIMES IN, ASKS GOVERNMENT TO FREE DMITRY
Adobe Systems is asking the government to release Russian programmer Dmitry
Skylarov, who was arrested last week in Las Vegas for violating the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by trafficking in code used to break the
encryption used to protect Adobe's eBook Reader software. An international
"Free Dmitry" movement has protested the government's action, which was
taken at Adobe's urging. Adobe now says that although it strongly supports
the DMCA and the enforcement of copyright protection of digital content, it
believes that " the prosecution of this individual in this particular case
is not conducive to the best interests of any of the parties involved or
the industry.'' A lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil
liberties advocacy group, said: "We explained to Adobe, imagine how you
would feel if one of your programmers was visiting in Russia and was
arrested for making software that was considered illegal there? It sort of
hit home with them that what they are doing here isn't right.'' However, a
government attorney prosecuting the case says: "This is a criminal case
brought by the United States against the defendant, and to that extent no
one else is a party.'' (San Jose Mercury News 24 Jul 2001)

[Bargain Hunters Delight!]

PC WORLDWIDE SALES LOWEST IN 15 YEARS
PC shipments fell 2% to 30 million units during the second quarter, Gartner
Research's Todd Kort says: "This is the first time we've had a worldwide
decline since 1986 on a year-over-year basis. Among the top five vendors in
the U.S., Dell was No. 1. They had a share of 23.6% of the market."
Shipments to Asia declined more than had been expected, and Europe
shipments also fell. Kort's analysis: "Without a major shift in the PC
industry structure, future sustained high-growth rates are improbable. For
the time being, vendors continue to opt for price-cutting rather than
changing PC design to stimulate growth." (Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 20

[As I Said About Everything Becoming Pay-Per-View. . . .]

BRITANNICA ADDS FEES FOR FULL-TEXT ACCESS
Britannica.com has become the latest content-based Web site to acknowledge
the need to charge for its information, joining news sites like the Wall
Street Journal and Inside.com, which unveiled a redesigned version of its
media-news site Wednesday, along with a new pricing scheme. Britannica says
it will soon begin charging users $5 a month or $50 for a year of access to
the full online text of Encyclopaedia Britannica, which has been free since
the site launched in October 1999. Banners and pop-up ads will be
restricted to the free parts of the site, where users will be able to read
the first few paragraphs of each encyclopedia article. Web readers "have to
face the real world -- which is that the broadcast-television model doesn't
work for three million independent Web sites," says Steve Brill, CEO of
Brill Media Holdings, which acquired Inside.com's parent company, Powerful
Media, in April. "It barely works for the four television networks." (Wall
Street Journal 19 Jul 2001)

G8 SETS PLAN TO BRIDGE DIGITAL DIVIDE
The Group of Eight's Digital Opportunity Task Force has produced
a report on tackling the global digital divide that calls for the
use of computers and technology as a way to fight poverty.
Vernon Ellis, international chairman of Accenture and a member of
the task force, said that technology can be used to improve
health and education and foster the growth of enterprise in poor
countries. Group of Eight members are urging the private sector
to help implement the nine strategies outlined in the report,
which include lowering the cost of Internet access and improving
connectivity, helping countries develop their own Internet plans,
and supporting entrepreneurs in these countries. The U.S.
government says it will allocate $100 million in funding to bring
the report's agenda to fruition, according to the Markle
Foundation.

COPY-PROTECTED CDS QUIETLY SLIP INTO STORES
Macrovision, in coordination with several major recording labels,
has for several months been piloting new technology to prevent
music consumers from copying CDs onto their PCs. The technology
distorts CD recordings with a series of audible pops and clicks
when the music is copied onto a PC. The Macrovision pilot is the
latest in a series of attempts by the recording industry to
protect music from digital piracy. Previous efforts have largely
failed, either because various industry elements have been unable
to agree on how to implement the technology or because the
technology also disrupted normal CD playback. The recording
industry's attempts to prevent the copying of CDs onto PCs
presents a legal quandary, however, because the courts have
recognized the right of consumers to copy copyright-protected
work for home use.

MICROSOFT SOFTENS XP ANTIPIRACY FEATURE
Microsoft has announced that it will alter the controversial
Product Activation policy in its forthcoming Windows XP operating
system so that users can modify a certain number of hardware
components inside their PC without having to register with the
company for a new access code. The policy, which is intended to
prevent the software from being copied to multiple PCs, has come
under fire because it restricts access to the operating system
if users make common changes to their PCs' hardware components.
Users who add a graphics card or additional memory, for example,
would have to contact Microsoft and re-register. Microsoft says
it will allow users to change a certain number of hardware
components within a limited amount of time--this time limit has
not been decided yet--without having to gain a new access code.

E-BOOKS IN LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
For the first time, the U.S. Copyright Office has received
copyright-registration submissions for full-length books in
digital format. McGraw-Hill has submitted two books to the
Copyright Office over the Internet. The Office verified the
submissions through digital signatures. Not only is the
Copyright Office the public record of copyright registrations,
but it also furnishes the Library of Congress with copies of
works. Noting the foresight that the Copyright Office and the
Library of Congress have shown in building a digital collection,
a spokesperson for McGraw-Hill said, "Readers and publishers
should be applauding."
(New York Times, 18 July 2001)

THE WAR OVER ROYALTY RATES
The U.S. Copyright Office issued a ruling that Internet music
firms can take part in the federal arbitration proceeding that
will determine the royalties Internet radio operators must pay
to recording companies. The Copyright Office found that the
firms have "a specific interest" in the arbitration process and
are therefore "entitled to participate." The recording industry
objected, arguing that these particular Internet music
firms--which include MTVi Group, Xact Radio, and Launch
Media--should not enter the proceedings, forcing the firms to
reach individual royalty agreements with recording companies,
most likely at rates higher than the federal arbitration will
set. The recording industry and the seven Internet music firms
involved filed lawsuits over the dispute, and the Copyright
Office concluded that the courts should ultimately decide.
