*The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter for Wednesday, May 16, 2001*

[Given the votes being split very evenly between weekly and monthly,
we are going to endeavor to present this Newsletter in both formats.
We will try to set up two listservers by our 30th Anniversary on the
4th of July, and you will get both versions until/unless you send an
unsubscribe message to the one you do not want to receive.  A larger
majority voted for both than for either just weekly or monthly.]

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*

***

With 3500 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $2.86 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.

This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts last May!!!!!!!

It may not always look as if we are making huge progress, but when you
compare these yearly figures, it begins to become obvious that we are!

*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*


***

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is 501(c)(3)!!!
We have added a couple more states to our registration list, more
details on all state paperwork below and in a separate message...
entitled "Project Gutenberg Needs You" which is a blatant request
for your support, if you are not interested, please delete it and
don't even open it. . .and accept my apologies for wasted space.

***

When we send out the Project Gutenberg Newsletters, we
have already posted all the files listed in that index
listing we include in the Newsletters [excepting those
marked as "reserved," of course.

While our human cataloguers and indexers of course can
not had time to add them to their files yet, computers
will already have them listed. . .and thus you will be
able to download them, literally only one second after
we have started to post them, even before our own post
of them has been completely uploaded. . . !

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:
http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02
or
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02

Or 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91, 90.


You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.

Our recent release of Etext #3333 in Portuguese has inspired the forming
of a Project Gutenberg Portuguese Team which has applied for gutenberg.pt
as a domain name.  If you are interested in being a founding member of
this team, please let me know.

Volunteers Needed: An offline distributed proofing/editing site has finally
reached version 1.0. We would like to have any volunteers that are not
currently assigned/busy to visit the site and see if any of our materials
are of interest. This site is designed specifically for people who would
like participate on their own computer and not be connected to the internet,
i.e. only a single modem line, pay for access (AOL or outside of the US) by
the minute, while traveling, etc. A volunteer requests a chapter of one of
our books via email, and the chapter is sent via return email. The chapter
is proofed and submitted back via email. We are trying to keep the
technology to a bare minimum, email address and text editor. The new web
address is http://www.metalbox.net/dcushman/pgroot.htm. If anyone has
questions, please let me know dcushman@texas.net.  Dewayne Cushman

The work on the Richard Burton Arabian Nights is nearing completion.
That means that I am getting ready to begin work on the John Payne
translation of Arabian Nights and the Jonathan Scott translation.
Additionally, there are still a few stories left to do from the Burton
translation and I am presently scanning a couple of Burton's other
books.  I'm looking for people who might be interested in working on a
tale from Arabian Nights (or perhaps a fairy tale from one Andrew Lang's
colour books). Please feel free to contact me at
jcbyers@capitalnet.com.  To see a list of Arabian Nights tales currently
available go to http://www.capitalnet.com/~jcbyers/available-tales.htm

GILT is a program to allow for the easy browsing of Project Gutenberg's
index file and the perusal of available etexts. It presents a list of
selectable titles and allows these to be downloaded with a single click.
Both the index and etexts can be downloaded over HTTP or FTP from a number
of Gutenberg mirror sites, through authenticating proxies if required.
Multiple etexts can be fetched simultaneously.

GILT is a Java application, using the Swing libraries to provide a
graphical user interface. It requires the Java 2 platform to run, i.e. a
Java development kit or runtime environment with a version number of 1.2
or greater. Tested platforms include MacOS X, GNU / Linux, and Solaris.
Versions of Java less than 1.2 are untested, and would require the Swing
extensions to be installed.

GILT is still in development. If you have a feature you would like to see
added, or wish to report a bug, please contact george.russell@strath.ac.uk
with details, and I'll see what can be done. Its also nice to receive
success stories, so if you get GILT running correctly I'd like to hear
about it. The homepage for GILT is http://dogma.freebsd-

U.S. NET POPULATION DECLINES FOR FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS
The overall number of U.S. household Internet accounts declined 0.29 percent
during the first quarter of 2001 to 68.5 million, according to a survey by
Telecommunications Reports International. Previous studies had pegged growth
averaging about 20 percent per quarter. "The study indicates that this drop
was due to subscriber accounts lost when the free ISP market saw several
companies cease operation," says TRI. "The number of subscribers in that
sector plummeted more than 19 percent during the first quarter." Free ISPs
such as NetZero, AltaVista and Kmart's Bluelight.com recently were forced to
shut down or move to fee-based services when online advertising revenues
dried up. Meanwhile, growth for paid dial-up access was up more than 7
percent to nearly 50 million subscribers during the first quarter of 2001,
although a TRI managing editor warned that there were signs of maturation in
the market: "[The free ISPs] were a factor, but not the whole story. We
think it's a maturation in that the universe of people who are going online
have done so already." (E-Commerce Times 9 May 2001)

ANTI-SPAM LEGISLATION IN U.S. HOUSE
The House Judiciary Committee is blocking an anti-spam bill that previously
passed the House Energy and Commerce Commission. The bill would impose a
$500 penalty for each piece of unsolicited e-mail a company distributes.
Judiciary Committee member Bob Goodlatte (R., VA) said: "Legislation should
be narrowly targeted to provide law enforcement with the tools they need to
combat abuses without opening the floodgates to frivolous litigation or
interfering with legitimate uses of e-mail for marketing purposes." The
Committee favors an alternative bill, sponsored by Goodlatte, that penalize
senders of unsolicited commercial messages only if the they used a bogus
return address. (AP/USA Today 10 May 2001)

OXFORD TARGETS THE INTERNET'S IMPACT ON SOCIETY
Oxford University has announced plans to create the Oxford Internet
Institute, a multidisciplinary center focused on the societal and ethical
impact of the Internet. According to UK Secretary of State for Education
David Blunkett, one of the center's top priorities will be research issues
surrounding cryptography, intellectual property and security. Research
programs will target the fundamental shifts in human behavior and
interactions as a result of technology, comparative media law and policy,
and creating new educational software. (InformationWeek 10 May 2001)

RAMBUS FOUND GUILTY OF FRAUD
In a back-and-forth legal battle with Infineon Technologies, memory chip
maker Rambus has been found guilty of fraud and slapped with punitive
damages of $3.5 million. The fine was later reduced to $350,000 because of
limitations in the local Virginia law. The verdict was a shocking
turnaround for Rambus, which had sued Infineon on 57 charges of patent
infringement. The jury agreed with Infineon's claim that Rambus had
committed fraud because it participated in a broad chip industry project to
develop fast memory chips, but did not reveal it had patents on similar
technology. The goal of the cooperative project was to develop chips that
would be royalty-free. (Financial Times 10 May 2001)

NEW DOMAIN NAMES COMING
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has entered
into contracts with the companies that will register two of the new Internet
domain names the organization recently approved. Ireland-based Afilias will
register names in the ".info" domain and Virginia-based NeuLevel will
register names in the ".biz" domain. The two companies plan to promote the
suffixes as alternatives to the U.S.-centric ".com" domain. (AP/San Jose

EVOLVING E-BOOKS LET AUTHORS ANSWER CRITICS
Princeton University has launched a new e-book program, Princeton
Digital Books Plus, that treats books as dynamic, rather than
static, objects. Under the program, each e-book author will be
able to participate in an online discussion following the release
of his or her e-book. The author's reply to issues raised in
that discussion will be included in future editions of the book.
"Republic.com" by University of Chicago professor Cass Sunstein
is the first e-book to be published under the arrangement, which
will include forum discussions on the news site Salon.com and on
the Princeton Digital Books Plus site. Sunstein's reply will be
available for download from Amazon.com for free and will be
included in the book's paperback edition. Princeton plans to
release a second e-book, "Breaking the Deadlock: The Supreme
Court and Election 2000" by University of Chicago professor
Richard Posner, on Jun. 15.
