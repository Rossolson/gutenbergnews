"When I was a young man I observed that nine out of ten things I did were
failures. I didn't want to be a failure, so I did ten times more work."
George Bernard Shaw


30 years ago today, Project Gutenberg posted the first electronic text
for download on what would eventually become the Internet. . .it was a
simple 5,000 byte file. . .all in CAPS. . .since computers didn't have
lower case yet back then. . .it was the US Declaration of Independence
and one similar Etext was added each year for the rest of the 1970's--

The 1980's saw a great expansion in the size of the Etexts being done,
with two majors works, each 1,000 times larger than the first one. . .
The Bible and The Complete Works Of William Shakespeare.

By July of 1991, there were 17 such Etexts including Project Gutenberg
receiving three major Etexts from outside sources:  Moby Dick, Roget's
Thesaurus, and The 1990 CIA Factbook.  Along with such classics as The
Adventures of Peter Pan and Alice [Wonderland and The Looking Glass] a
new generation of readers had been born.

For each one of those 17 Etexts that were available in 1971, there are
now over 1,000 Etexts listed in the Internet Public Library alone!!!

Just a few years ago, when there were only 10,000, people said this is
the kind of growth pattern that could not continue, but as you read on
below, you will see that it will not only continue, but that we should
still be able to expect 1,000,000 files by 2010 if support continues.

It's hard to realize that Project Gutenberg has been around as long as
Sesame Street and Big Bird, as long as ABC's Wide World Of Sports or a
variety of other continuing events we think of historically, even such
events as the Super Bowl only came into their own about 30 years ago--
believe it or not, the first Super Bowl, even though it was broadcast,
taped, and filmed by BOTH CBS and NBC, all the complete TV recordings,
no kidding, were tossed out, along with most of the other recordings a
world of television and movies has lost throughout the years. . .

Yet not one word of Project Gutenberg has been lost throughout all the
time since July 4th, 1971. . . .

During that time Project Gutenberg has release approximately 3600 text
and other files, for an average of 120 per year, about 1 every 3 days.

Of course, as with all logathrimic growth, half of our work was done a
much shorter while ago with our 100th Etext not coming until then very
end of 1993, officially released in January, 1994. . .even then we all
tried to be a little ahead of schedule for better proofreading. . . .

The 1,000th Etext would come in 1997, and would be Dante in Italian, a
major effort to include the classics of other languages. . .though our
releases that same day included two English translations.

Our 2,000th Etext would continue this trend, with the Spanish classic,
Don Quijote.

We started a new trend of original translations with Siddhartha, since
the original translations were still under copyright monopoly, but the
original German had just expired under US copyright law.  Again we did
both the English and German versions, a trend we hope to continue with
more efforts similar to those of our Etexts #2499 and 2500.

For #3000 we started our collection of Proust, in the original French.

And for our recent #3500, we did Ceiriog, in Welsh.

So far we have released Etexts in 16 different languages, and have our
first Greek Etext in progress, as well as one that will include a text
in translation in at least 77 languages.

It looks as though we will complete 1,000 Etexts this year, and soon a
monthly count of 100.

Welcome to the future. . .

in which we hope to post Etexts in all languages, with sites in nearly
all countries, and through which we hope to give away a quadrillion of
these Etext titles to a billion readers around the world.

***

I give my heartfelt thanks to the thousands of volunteers who bring us
these Etexts. . .

Never in the field of education have so many received so much from so few.



Here is a list of the Etexts posted since last month,
these are "cut and pasted" from the weekly Newsletter,
so there will be references to each individual week.
At least one was accidentally listed twice. . . .

book-like view with automatic page numbering. Main features include font
style/size selection, bookmarks, copying/searching/editing text, and line
break options. Bookmarks, current page number, font settings, and line break
modes are stored individually for each text file. The last filename is
remembered - open it with one click and continue reading at the page where
you've stopped. (Software by  Thomas Fellner - tomsoft@attglobal.net).
