Col Choate has moved his Project Gutenberg of Australia website
from:  http://au.geocities.com/gutenberg_au/
to:    http://gutenberg.net.au/

Here's more information from Project Gutenberg of Australia:

Project Gutenberg of Australia

Here in Oz we are celebrating the launch of our permanent PG site,
gutenberg.net.au, after being temporarily located at au.geocities.com
for a time.

We have 19 books listed which are in the public domain in Australia so
why not drop in and have a look!  We also have listed all of the PG
etexts (from both the US and Oz sites) which were written by
Australians or which relate (loosely) to Australia.

Books enter the public domain in Australia 50 years after the author's
death, provided they were published during the author's lifetime. For
translations, the same rules apply to the person translating.
Therefore, we only need to be satisfied that the author died at least
50 years ago and that the work was published during his/her
lifetime. Copyright cannot be renewed or revived by subsequent
publication, nor does a copyright held by a person other than the
author have any validity in such cases.

Of course, works which are in the public domain in Australia may
remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not download, or
read online, such books if they are in a country where copyright
protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death. The
author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral
rights to oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot
of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary
works of the twentieth century.

If you require more information or would like to submit an etext,
contact Col Choat at colc@gutenberg.net.au.


***

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 11/14/01**:  4,112
(This number includes the 19 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

Thru 10/31/01:  46 Weeks & 2 Days (324 days)
                 1,062 total new etexts, yr-to-date.
                 Weekly avg.:  23.09
                 Daily avg:     3.28

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,062 For 324 days,
this is 3.28 per day or 98.33 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1,197 For The Year. . . .
We are about 46 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.

FBI TARGETS SUSPECTS' PCs WITH SPY VIRUS

The FBI is working on software that could insert a computer virus into a
suspect's computer capable of reading encrypted data. The software, known
as "Magic Lantern," installs "keylogging" software that can capture
keystrokes typed on a computer. The virus can be sent via e-mail and once
on the targeted PC, it waits for a suspect to launch the Pretty Good
Privacy encryption program and then logs the passphrase used to start the
program, essentially giving agents access to the keys needed to decrypt
files. The Magic Lantern software is part of the FBI's "Enhanced Carnivore
Project Plan," which operates under the umbrella project name of Cyber
Knight. Electronic Privacy Information Center attorney David Sobel says
privacy issues arise when keylogging results in "overly broad" searches,
since it would be possible to observe every keystroke typed by the suspect,
even if a court order specified only encryption keys. The FBI has already
used a less-sophisticated version of the software to build the high-profile
racketeering case against Nicodemo Scarfo, but had to manually turn the
system on and off in order to comply with the court order. (MSNBC/Wall

NOBEL LAUREATES OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE INTERNET

A newly released Cisco Systems-sponsored survey has found that 71 of 259
living Nobel laureates (mostly scientists) are generally optimistic about
the promise of the Internet to continue improving education and science
over the next decades and opening up dialogues between different cultures
and countries to produce a safer world. The survey was conducted between
July and October of this year. (San Jose Mercury News 20 Nov 2001)

HONORARY SUBSCRIBER: SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN
      Today's Honorary Subscriber is the renowned architect Sir Christopher
Wren (1632-1723), who was also highly regarded by Newton and Pascal for his
scientific work in astronomy and geometry.
      Considered the greatest English architect of his time, he was
knighted in 1673 and was a founder of the Royal Society, serving as its
president in the years 1680-1682. Wren's opportunity for lasting fame came
in 1666 when the Great Fire of London reduced two-thirds of the city to a
smoking wasteland. Initially called upon to plan the rebuilding of the
entire city, his design was judged impractical, and his actual role was
reduced to the rebuilding of 51 churches, including a newly designed St.
Paul's Cathedral.
      Except for St. Paul's, his churches were modest structures consisting
of a spire and an interior space, often set on cramped, irregular sites.
Wren concerned himself only with the general plan, leaving the interior to
be decorated according to the taste and means of each parish. Only St.
Paul's was planned on grand scale. Wren prepared several designs, including
a Greek cross plan preserved in a wooden model still kept in the cathedral.
His final plan used a Latin cross design surmounted by a monumental dome,
modeled after the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and second to it in
size.
      Wren worked on St. Paul's from about 1670 until 1710. Like
Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's is a national pantheon where many of
England's famous men are entombed, including Wren himself.

SOFTWARE COMPANIES VIE TO PROVIDE SAUDIS WITH INTERNET FILTERS

When the Internet was introduced in Saudi Arabia in 1999, the Saudi royal
family decreed that all public traffic into and out of the country would
have to be funneled through a single control outside Riyadh. The contract
for providing the filtering software to make that level of control possible
will expire in 2003, and companies from the U.S., U.K., Germany and the
Netherlands are engaged in spirited competition for the multimillion
assignment. Yale law professor Jack Balkin says, "We have a really serious
problem in terms of the American free speech idea. But it is very American
to make money. Between anticensorship and the desire to make money, the
desire to make money will win out." The sites blocked by the Saudis are
pornographic or offer other challenges to Islamic political or cultural
sensitivities. (New York Times 19 Nov 2001)

MONITORING THE MESSAGE BOARDS
With the U.S. at war with terrorism, various Web services are choosing to
decline submissions from people saying the country "deserved" to be attacked
or making other comments along those lines. Stephen Killeen of Terra Lycos
U.S. says that, in the past, "we would err on the side of `If it's
distasteful, let it stay.' Now, we err on the side of `If you want to post
this kind of information, you don't have to do it here.' The sentiment in
the United States changed on Sept. 11 about what's acceptable and what's not
in terms of what you can say." Of course, people are free to set up Web
sites of their own and post whatever they want, just as private companies
are free to accept or reject anything they want. UCLA law professor Stuart
Biegel says, "In times of war, there has been a willingness among Americans
to give up some rights -- to honor curfews, martial law, and even
restrictions on speech. The filtering of Internet message boards is part of
all this." (San Jose Mercury News 18 Nov 2001)

WORTH THINKING ABOUT: SIMULATED EMOTIONS

     In the new book "The Invisible Future: The Seamless of Integration of
Technology Into Everyday Life" (ed. by Peter J. Denning), psychologist and
leadership trainer Richard Strozzi Heckler warns  that "cyberspace teaches
us to be passive observers, not skilled participants in life." He writes:
     "I am no Luddite and do not endorse returning our technological
advances to the shelves. But I do believe that if we do not pay attention to
how we are being led by technology, and are not leading it, we will, in the
words of anthropologist Angeles Arrien, 'Normalize the abnormal and
abnormalize the normal.' We have come to a historical moment in which it is
necessary to reexamine what we mean by education and quality of life.
Sitting for hours in front of a computer screen alienates us from our deep
biological urge to interact with the living: humans, animals, the landscape,
weather, the seas. We are designed to interact with life; to cooperate,
share, and reciprocate with others, to seek trust, adventure, and love is
the human experience. To blithely dismiss this finely tuned legacy of
wisdom, which is to dismiss life itself, by the allure of a virtual reality,
does not come without its consequences. Perhaps we can simulate intelligence
through computerized machines, but there is a terrible cost to humanity if
we attempt to simulate emotions and thus antiseptically cleanse ourselves of
the human qualities of love, passion, and self-reflection."

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.  

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

  gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
  gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

	subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

	subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

	unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
