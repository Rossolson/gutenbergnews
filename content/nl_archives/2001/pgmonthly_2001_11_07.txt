There is a website called Blackmask (<http://www.blackmask.com>)
which takes public domain texts and converts each one into
several file formats, including palm, acrobat, etc.

There is a non-commercial website that links to the product
databases of a large number of antiquarian book sellers.
It has a search engine, and it is very easy to locate
just about any old book edition, often at cheap prices:

We're looking for copies of older newsletters for historical purposes --
they seem to have gone missing. Specifically we're looking for the
following: Feb, 1997; Jan-May plus Aug-Sep-Oct, 1996; and for
any newsletters prior to 1996, although we do have Mar of 1995 and Sep of
1994. If you have any of these newsletters, please send a copy to George
Davis <gbdavis at harborside dot com>. Thank you.

--=={ AND NOW, THIS MONTH'S ETEXTS ADDED AND REVISED }==--

This month, we have posted 103 new etexts, plus 4 at the Project 
Gutenburg of Australia site.  We have also posted a significant 
number of new versions of existing Etexts, including versions for 
portable devices, as well as .HTML versions.  This first section 
of revisions and corrections is, therefore, unusually longer than 
normal.  The section announcing newly posted editions follows this 
long section.
