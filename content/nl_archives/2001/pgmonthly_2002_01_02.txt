DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory
B. Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

<http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>
or
<ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

***

Looking for non-English etexts?  Try the "advanced search" feature at:

http://promo.net/cgi-promo/pg/t9.cgi

This allows you to search by language. Currently, there are
etexts in Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch/Flemish, French,
German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Swedish and
Welsh.  And, of course, English; and there are some who would
count the language of DNA/GATC. . .

And very-recently we added our first etext in Greek.

Let's do even more languages. . .

For a list of mirrors (copies) of the Project Gutenberg
collection, view http://promo.net/pg/list.html

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
of North America.  For information about how to set one
up, contact Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

The most recent list we received indicated these were all "life +50"
countries for copyright expiration:

Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize,
Benin, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech
Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Ghana, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan,
(South) Korea, Latvia, Lebanon, Malawi, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Oman, Pakistan, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Qatar, St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia,
and Ukraine.

Works which are in the public domain in Australia and other "Life +50"
countries may remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not
download, or read online, such books if they are in a country where
copyright protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death.
The author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral
rights to oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot
of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary
works of the twentieth century.

And now the Monthly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 01/02/02**:  4,292
(This number includes the 34 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

Thru 01/02/01:  52 Weeks (364 days)
                 1,240 total new etexts, yr-to-date.
                 Monthly avg: 103.33
                 Weekly avg:   23.85
                 Daily avg:     3.41

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,240,
this is 3.41 per day or 102.2 Per 30 day month. . . .
We are 52 weeks through the year. . .next week we will
start a new 52 week calendar year of eBook production!

These statistics are calculated based on full weeks of production,
each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting with the first
Wednesday in Jan.  In 2001, Jan 3rd was the first Wednesday, and
Jan 10th was the end of the first week of production.  And on this
basis, etexts announced between Dec 26, 2001 and Jan 2, 2002 will
be counted as the last production of 2001.

Five years ago, in Dec 1996, we announced etext #768; this
represented the output for the first 25 years of Project
Gutenberg.  Five years later there are more than 4,250
Project Gutenberg eBooks online.

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

     gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
     gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

           subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

           subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

           unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
