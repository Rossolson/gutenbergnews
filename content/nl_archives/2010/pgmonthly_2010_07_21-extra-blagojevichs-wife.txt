Blagojevich's wife reads Sherlock Holmes at trial Mon Jul 19, 3:01 pm ET

CHICAGO – The wife of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich has been
engrossed in mysteries. But they have nothing to do with her husband's
corruption trial.

Patti Blagojevich said during a break Monday that she's been reading "The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," a short story collection by Arthur Conan
Doyle, on her cell phone.

The fictional, pipe-smoking detective also appeared in a defense motion
seeking Blagojevich's acquittal. Lawyers cited Doyle's caution against
twisting facts to suit theories rather than the other way around.

Patti Blagojevich has been seen reading from her phone during several
less-riveting stretches of the case. She says she's also fond of Jane Austen.

Her husband has pleaded not guilty to charges including that he schemed to
sell President Barack Obama's former Senate seat.
