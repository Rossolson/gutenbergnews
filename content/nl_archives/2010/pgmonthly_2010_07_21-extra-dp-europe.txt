The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter Extra--Jul. 21, 2010
eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


Is anyone in touch with the people at PG Europe and/or DP Europe?

I haven't had any replies to my emails for ages from rastko, etc.

However, new items appear each month at:

http://dp.rastko.net/default.php

so it is obvious that things are progressing, probably I just had
out of date email addresses.


Please advise,


Thanks!!!


It's "The Year of the eBook!"
