The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter, Nov. 21, 2008 eBooks Readable By 
Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


By the time I wake up in the morning, it will be a time you usually expect The 
Monthly Newsletter so I am doing my best to get everything done before going 
to bed.

However, I should warn you that my arithmetic lost some
11 eBooks in the shuffle, as noted below, but I'm going have to send this out 
as is and call it a day, as it is well after midnight here in Hawaii.



49 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring on December 21, 2012 
[some now saying October 11, 2011]

This leaves 4 1/12 years, 16 1/3 seasons, or 49 months.

Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions.



New Project Gutenberg Landmarks and Headlines


We just passed 375 books in Chinese at:

http://www.gutenberg.org

and there are more at:

http://www.gutenberg.cc


After several years of making Chinese eBooks a top priority as a personal 
project, Chinese just passed Dutch, to become the newest member of Project 
Gutenberg's "Top 5 Languages."


The new goal is to put Spanish into our "Top 5 list."


We also officially passed 30,000 original Project Gutenberg eBooks this past 
month, including all our usual listings.

This means the original Project Gutenberg editions now list as many titles as 
the average U.S. public library.


Please note that PrePrints now has nearly 2,500 eBooks!!!




The News In More Detail


Chinese Moves Into The Project Gutenberg "Top 5"


More help needed to complete hundreds more Chinese eBooks.


As you will notice in the language list below, Chinese will apparently be 
moving up to our 4th place language, counting non-English eBooks.

We still need more help in cataloging these eBooks, but the latest 300 or so 
Chinese eBooks are now in PrePrints.

Anyone who can work in Chinese is encouraged to look into a directory called 
/china in PrePrints, or get the .zip file, from one directory above to get all 
the files downloaded in one single command.

http://preprints.readingroo.ms

first one on the list:

/china

.zip of whole bunch is one directory up, get china.zip

The current list, NOT counting the new 307 PrePrints:

Grand total for today: 27188 [Yesterday, officially]

23075   English en
1319    French  fr
553     German  de
476     Finnish fi
377     Chinese zh
361     Dutch   nl
267     Portuguese      pt
217     Spanish es
164     Italian it


When we get all 307 possible titles online, that will bring Chinese up to a 
total of ~675 which will place it second of our non-English languages 
collection which is approximately where it should go, given Internet language 
dispersal.

The times are changing, and we can either lead or follow.

Believe it or not, Spanish is listed as the third language, with regard to its 
use on the entire Internet so that's the next goal, to bring Spanish to out 
Top 5.

In reference to that goal, I am giving a presentation for a new combination of 
Internet efforts called "Both Americas,"
in Buenos Aires early next Spring, followed by what I would hope will be a 
similar conference in France.  India has had one or more problems with getting 
an actual invitation sent to me, and since their current conference will be 
over less than a month from now, I will not be able to attend even if such an 
invitation is issue at the last moment unless it is of such an unusual nature 
that I can't turn it down and may have to interrupt another trip I have now 
scheduled during, and including the same period, the coming month.

This is the second time a conference hosted by people I had contact with in 
India has not worked out due to inabilities to get things organized in a 
manner that does not cost me a great deal of time and money, neither of which 
I have great amounts of to invest in any but the wisest of manners.

I fear the conference in France may be headed the direction it was headed in 
last year, much as did the other one I had mentioned above, but right now I 
can't say for sure that it is either going to actually happen, or that I may 
speak.

Something I should mention about possible conferences:

If all the plans are not made, tickets purchased, arranged, etc., so that I 
can at least expect to break even on trips, at least one month in advance, the 
odds of my attending the conference fall very rapidly to zero.  So far the 
only ones keeping up their end of the bargain are the "Both Americas"
hosting the conference in Buenos Aires, so that appears the only conference I 
am certain to attend in six months.

Greg Newby and I have made an attempt to set up one of few, very few, 
conference appearances with a joint presentation, but we haven't heard a word 
back from that one either, so I won't even mention it at the moment.

Project Gutenberg just doesn't have the money for us to get to conferences 
where we would lose money in the process.




Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!



FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were Disgo/Dizgo, M-Systems and these were OEMed 
by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular in a recognizable fashion because their 
snapon connectors resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.




POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.

Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and totals from PG of 
Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

You should notice that we had a very good month, with 100 books done nearly 
every single week.


These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at:

http://www.gutenberg.cc

Where there are eBooks representing over 100 languages.



These are the various totals from the ~30,000 at:

http://www.gutenberg.org

and our other Project Gutenberg Sites

[Yesterday's message, no mail coming in right now, but if I send this two 
different ways, I think ONE of them will get to you.]

Sorry, it's midnight plus here in Hawaii, too tired. . . .


Note:  Without counting PrePrints, we are still under 30K, and some of the new 
.lit collection will not make it under our current rules of addition from 
PrePrints, and would be deleted from PrePrints without moving to other 
listings.

Note:  There are perhaps 100 eBooks not listed here that are already in 
circulation from Project Gutenberg.

Note:  PG Canada includes English, French, and Italian.
