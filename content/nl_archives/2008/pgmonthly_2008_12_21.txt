Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter <gweekly@lists.pglaf.org>

If you appear on BOTH lists you may get two copies.

If you get NO copy next month, be sure you are on MONTHLY.

Let me know if you need info on subbing and unsubbing.


Happy New Year Everyone!!!

Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter

The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter, Dec. 21, 2008 eBooks Readable By 
Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


I'm expecting a rather busy day the 21st, so I am doing as much of the 
Newsletter half a day early as possible, so be forewarned, some of the numbers 
may be a day late or early, depending on how you look at things.


Happy Holidays!!!

Give The World eBooks in 2009!!!


48 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring on December 21, 2012 
[some now saying October 11, 2011]

This leaves 4 years. 16 seasons, or 48 months.

Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions.



New Project Gutenberg Landmarks and Headlines




The new goal is to put Spanish into our Top 5 list.

I desperately need some Spanish speaking people to help me!



We also officially passed 32,000 original Project Gutenberg eBooks this past 
month, including all our usual listings.

This means the original Project Gutenberg editions now list as many titles as 
the average U.S. public library.


Please note that PrePrints now has nearly 2,500 eBooks!!!

Well worth looking into:

We could use someone to write a piece about PrePrints.

We also need more help with the Chinese eBooks there.



The News In More Detail



The times are changing, and we can either lead or follow.


If we don't lead in the field of Chinese eBooks we follow-- and we are 
starting a Project Gutenberg of Chinese, for all who may wish to get in on the 
ground floor.

Believe it or not, Spanish is listed as the third language, with regard to its 
use on the entire Internet so that's the next goal, to bring Spanish to out 
Top 5.

In reference to that goal, I am giving a presentation for a new combination of 
Internet efforts called Both Americas, in Buenos Aires early next Spring, 
followed by what I would hope will be a similar conference in France.  India 
has had one or more problems with getting an actual invitation sent to me, and 
since their current conference will be over less than a month from now, I will 
not be able to attend even if such an invitation is issue at the last moment 
unless it is of such an unusual nature that I can't turn it down and may have 
to interrupt another trip I have now scheduled during, and including the same 
period, the coming month.

This is the second time a conference hosted by people I had contact with in 
India has not worked out due to inabilities to get things organized in a 
manner that does not cost me a great deal of time and money, neither of which 
I have great amounts of to invest in any but the wisest of manners.

I BRING THIS UP AGAIN BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH LATELY!

HENCE MY NEED FOR ASSISTANCE WITH SPANISH!!!


I fear the conference in France may be headed the direction it was headed in 
last year, much as did the other one I had mentioned above, but right now I 
can't say for sure that it is either going to actually happen, or that I may 
speak.

Something I should mention about possible conferences

If all the plans are not made, tickets purchased, arranged, etc., so that I 
can at least expect to break even on trips, at least one month in advance, the 
odds of my attending the conference fall very rapidly to zero.  So far the 
only ones keeping up their end of the bargain are the Both Americas hosting 
the conference in Buenos Aires, so that appears the only conference I am 
certain to attend in six months.

AND NOW THERE ARE DOUBTS ABOUT THAT!!!


Greg Newby and I have made an attempt to set up one of few, very few, 
conference appearances with a joint presentation, but we haven't heard a word 
back from that one either, so I won't even mention it at the moment.

Project Gutenberg just doesn't have the money for us to get to conferences 
where we would lose money in the process.




Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!



FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems and these were OEMed 
by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular in a recognizable fashion because their 
snapon connectors resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.




POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.





Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and totals from PG of 
Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

You should notice that we had a very good month, with 100 books done nearly 
every single week.


These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at

http://www.gutenberg.cc

Where there are eBooks representing over 100 languages.



These are the various totals from the ~30,000 at

http://www.gutenberg.org

and our other Project Gutenberg Sites

Note  Without counting PrePrints, we are still about 30K, and some of the new 
.lit collection will not make it under our current rules of addition from 
PrePrints, and would be deleted from PrePrints without moving to other 
listings.

The 307 Chinese eBooks in PrePrints will probably go, as a team of our best 
Chinese workers says they are not worth a lot more time to work on, etc.

Note  There are perhaps 100 eBooks not listed here that are already in 
circulation from Project Gutenberg.

Note  PG Canada includes English, French, and Italian.





Here is how we ended 2007

The combined PG projects had produced a total of 26,161

titles.


The most number of books posted...
  ...in one day was 65 on the 26th December
  ...in one week was 151 in Week 18 (week ending 9th May)
  ...in one month was 477 in November

We averaged
338 per month [Over 4,000 for the year]
  78 per week
  11.13 per day

99 titles were newly REposted to the new filing system,

bringing us almost to the 2,000 mark.


Here is a small selection of project milestones;
