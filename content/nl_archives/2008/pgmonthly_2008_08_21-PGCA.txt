Here's the news from PG Canada for July.

We published a total of 14 ebooks during the month: we have now published a 
cumulative total of 152 ebooks.

The New Releases section at the top of the PGC main page always gives the 
details of new releases for the most recent three months.

LANGUAGES:
- 8 titles were in English,
- 6 were in French,

GENRES
- 5 of the books were novels, including a French translation by Pamphile Le 
May of William Kirby's "The Golden Dog"
- 1 was a book of short stories
- 5 were poetry, including a French translation by Pamphile Le May of 
Longfellow's "Evangeline"
- 1 was a book of drawings
- 2 of the books were non-fiction

Ten of the books were by Canadians, or had a significant link to Canada.

The month was notable for the addition of six books by Pamphile Le May
(1837-1918): four original works, and two translations.

We published two new titles in progress in our series of novels by English 
novelist Sheila Kaye-Smith (1887-1956).

We were very proud of this year's choice for Canada Day (July 1st).  It was a 
1926 edition of "Le Chien d'Or", a translation of "The Golden Dog".  The 
author, William Kirby (1817-1906), and the translator, Pamphile Le May (1837-
1918), are both celebrated names in Canadian literature, while the annotator, 
Benjamin Sulte
(1841-1923) is a famous Canadian historian.
