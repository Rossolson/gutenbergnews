Here is the news from PG Canada for December.

We published a total of 18 ebooks during the month: we have now published a 
cumulative total of 228 ebooks.

The New Releases section at the top of the PGC main page always gives the 
details of new releases for the most recent three months.

LANGUAGES:
- 14 in English
- 4 in French

GENRES
- 9 books for children
- 6 novels
- 1 set of short stories
- 1 book of poetry
- 1 biography

2 of this month's ebooks were by Canadians or had a connection to Canada.

17 of this month's titles were fiction, and 1 was non-fiction.  This is a 
higher proportion of fiction than usual, and to some extent reflects an 
editorial decision to offer a higher proportion than usual of "holiday 
reading" titles during the holiday season.

Authors new to PGC this month included:

Fyleman, Rose Amy (1877-1957) [English children's author] Gilchrist, Anne 
(1828-1885) [English biographer and essayist] Lewis, Percy Wyndham (1882-1957) 
[Canadian writer and painter] Vautel, Clément [pseudonyme de Clément-Henri 
Vaulet] (1875 [ou
1876]-1954) [Journaliste français]
