TALKING BOOKS  
---------------------------------------
The term "DAISY" (Digital Accessible Information SYstem) is used to refer to a 
standard for producing accessible and navigable multimedia documents. In 
current practice, these documents are Digital Talking Books, digital text 
books, or a combination of synchronized audio and text books. DAISY is a 
globally recognized technical standard to facilitate the creation of 
accessible content. The standard was originally developed to benefit people 
who are unable to read print due to a disability, but it also has broad 
applications for improved access to text in the mainstream. The DAISY Standard 
has been evolving over the last several years and has recently been officially 
recognized by an American standards- making body. 

"Beyond Books, Beyond Barriers" is the talking book library of Western 
Australia. It is a joint project of the State Library of Western Australia and 
the Association for the Blind of Western Australia (ABWA). Recently, a list of 
books available at PGA was added to the library catalogue in the form of a 
MARC file -- See http://gutenberg.net.au/marc.html. Users of the "Beyond 
Books, Beyond Barriers" library catalogue can request that an ebook be made 
available in DAISY format and the ebook is converted so that it can be read on 
a DAISY reader, for which free software is available. For those wishing to do 
the conversion to the DAISY format themselves, there is a plug-in to the "free 
and open productivity suite", Open Office, which enables DAISY books to be 
created from text files. 

When I first started making ebooks, about 10 years ago, people were always 
telling me that no one would want to read books while sitting at a computer. I 
had to agree, but would tell them that I was "waiting for technology to catch 
up". To tell the truth, I too sometimes wondered just how useful ebooks were, 
beyond serving as a quick way of referencing quotations from them. Now it 
seems as though the technology HAS caught up-- here we are with free ebooks, 
free ebook software, international production standards, and ebook-reader 
hardware which is becoming more affordable each year. Of course, However, I am 
still waiting for that breakthrough, so that I can relax in bed and read 
ebooks as a hologram on the inside of my eyelids. Look, no hands!

MILES FRANKLIN (1879-1954) -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Franklin 
---------------------------------------
The Miles Franklin award -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Franklin_Award 
-- is, as the Wikipedia article just cited puts it, "an annual literary prize 
for the best Australian 'published novel or play portraying Australian life in 
any of its phases.'" It is a well known award. Somewhat less well known are 
the literary works of Miles Franklin herself. She is best known for "My 
Brilliant Career," published in 1901. However, her other works, including a 
number written under the pseudonym "Brent of Bin Bin", are always readable and 
are a valuable chronicle of Australian pioneer life. 

This month we have placed online two of her novels, "All that Swagger" and "Up 
the Country." Those works, together with "My Brilliant Career," can be 
accessed from http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#franklin2. Other 
Franklin works are in the pipeline and 
will be placed online in coming months. 
 
 
MULGA BILL'S BICYCLE 
--------------------------------------------  
 
'Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that caught the cycling craze; 
He turned away the good old horse that served him many days; 
He dressed himself in cycling clothes, resplendent to be seen; 
He hurried off to town and bought a shining new machine; 
And as he wheeled it through the door, with air of lordly pride, 
The grinning shop assistant said, 'Excuse me, can you ride?' 
 
'See, here, young man,' said Mulga Bill, 'from Walgett to the sea, 
From Conroy's Gap to Castlereagh, there's none can ride like me. 
I'm good all round at everything, as everybody knows, 
Although I'm not the one to talk -- I HATE a man that blows. 
But riding is my special gift, my chiefest, sole delight; 
Just ask a wild duck can it swim, a wild cat can it fight. 
There's nothing clothed in hair or hide, or built of flesh or steel, 
There's nothing walks or jumps, or runs, on axle, hoof, or wheel, 
But what I'll sit, while hide will hold and girths and straps are tight: 
I'll ride this here two-wheeled concern right straight away at sight.' 
 
'Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that sought his own abode, 
That perched above the Dead Man's Creek, beside the mountain road. 
He turned the cycle down the hill and mounted for the fray, 
But ere he'd gone a dozen yards it bolted clean away. 
It left the track, and through the trees, just like a silver streak, 
It whistled down the awful slope, towards the Dead Man's Creek. 
 
It shaved a stump by half an inch, it dodged a big white-box: 
The very wallaroos in fright went scrambling up the rocks, 
The wombats hiding in their caves dug deeper underground, 
As Mulga Bill, as white as chalk, sat tight to every bound. 
It struck a stone and gave a spring that cleared a fallen tree, 
It raced beside a precipice as close as close could be; 
And then as Mulga Bill let out one last despairing shriek 
It made a leap of twenty feet into the Dead Man's Creek. 
 
'Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that slowly swam ashore: 
He said, 'I've had some narrer shaves and lively rides before; 
I've rode a wild bull round a yard to win a five pound bet, 
But this was the most awful ride that I've encountered yet. 
I'll give that two-wheeled outlaw best; it's shaken all my nerve 
To feel it whistle through the air and plunge and buck and swerve. 
It's safe at rest in Dead Man's Creek, we'll leave it lying still; 
A horse's back is good enough henceforth for Mulga Bill.'
