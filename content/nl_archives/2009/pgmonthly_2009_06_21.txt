Headline News



More eBooks To More People Via More Hardware and Software


The 39th year of Project Gutenberg will begin July 4th, 2009-- and we will 
once again be one of larger sponsors of The World eBook Fair at 
http://www.worldebookfair.org, which will reach the neighborhood of ~2.5 
million eBooks from July 4 to August 4, starting in about two weeks.

One of the major developments this year is the advance in the variety of 
hardware and software methods of reading eBooks in more circumstances, more 
locations, and, of course, with more eBooks in wider and wider circulation.

We will be sending out a special edition of this Newsletter a few weeks from 
now dedicated to these.



Our 25,000th eBook In English Will Be Coming Up Shortly


If you have any ideas, suggestions, comments, etc., about how we might 
commemorate this event, please let us know.



We Just Published Our:

200th eBook in Italian
400th eBook in Chinese
500th eBook in Finnish


We are coming up on our 250th in Spanish. . .suggestions???





iPhone Acquisition


As you know, we try to get one of each of the popular reading devices to test 
how our eBooks work on them and demonstrate a wide variety of reading options.

A friend is updating his iPhone today and I am buying his old one, so we would 
appreciate any suggestions of which programs we should load to demonstrate the 
widest variety of readers.



Some interesting notes about eBooks of various varieties:

National archives reviews purchases of paper materials in digital age Library 
and Archives Canada has put a moratorium on buying paper documents and books 
for its collection. Full Story:

Google Books Improves -
http://www.slaw.ca/2009/06/18/google-books-improves/

Google Books has released a number of improvements designed to make reading 
and sharing their material easier. The Books blog, Inside Google Book Search 
lists seven changes:




- embedding and links - From the new toolbar on a Books page you can copy a 
link to the source or the html necessary to produce an iframe in your blog or 
web page that will embed the source.

- improved search - There's now more context around your search terms, and you 
can rank your search results by relevance as well as page order.

- thumbnail view - More useful, perhaps, where images are involved, you can 
see an overview in thumbnails of the book you're examining.

- drop-down menu - The drop-down menu displays links to the various divisions 
within the book.

- plain text mode - Viewers can turn off the html mode and work simply with 
plain text.

- page turn animation - This feature, invoked by clicking at the bottom of


the screen, simulates a more natural progression through the book.

- improved book overview - There's more data about the book offered on the 
overview page.






British Library Publishes Online Archive of 19th-Century Newspapers Maev 
Kennedy The Guardian Thursday 18 June 2009

A shorter URL for the above link:

Over two million pages of 19th and early 20th century newspapers go online 
today, part of the vast British Library collection.

The 49 British national and regional titles cover events including the Battle 
of Waterloo in June 1815 "Vague reports have been made of the numbers slain on 
both sides ... We should not quote them if our silence could prevent the

spreading of disastrous intelligence", the Morning Chronicle reported. There 
was also the banks crisis of 1878, the first FA Cup final in 1872, and the 
triumph of the music hall star Vesta Tilley in a talent contest.

The site

<http://newspapers.bl.uk/blcs>


holds journals including the True Crime of its day, the Illustrated Police 
News which covered the Jack the Ripper murders. The British Library worked in 
partnership with the Joint Information Systems Committee and Gale, part of 
Cengage Learning, to create the service. Searches are free, but users can pay 
to download information.

["Can pay"???  I wonder if that translates into "must pay,"
unless one is a certain kind of member or the like?]




Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!



FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems and these were OEMed 
by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular in a recognizable fashion because their 
snapon connectors resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

We received two examples of RAM actually labeled "Flash,"
for the H-P 95 pocket DOS machine from 1991, and a sample of Fairchild bubble 
memory, as well, from down under.

Thank you, Mate!



POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.





Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and totals from PG of 
Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

You should notice that we had a very good month, with 100 books done nearly 
every single week.
