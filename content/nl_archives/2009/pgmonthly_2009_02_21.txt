45 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring
on December 21, 2012 [some now saying October 11, 2011]

Leaving 3 years 10 months, 15 1/3 seasons or 45 months.

Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions.



First Prediction:  Computers Will Look And Sound Different


When you look at a wall of computers, in use, in five years,
you will notice something different. . .you might notice the
difference even now in some places. . .sleeker, quieter, and
WHAT?  NO HUMMING???

More and more computers, including heavy duty severs, should
be coming your way with NO MOVING PARTS, except probably DVD
drives, as some people will still demand horse drawn items.

I have one friend who got one of these new servers running a
week or two ago as is amazed at how much more it can do with
so much less storage space. . .it is FAST!!!  The new SSD is
able to leap tall buildings with a single bound. . . .

I told another friend a week ago and he has installed two of
these new SSDs [Solid State Drives] and is equally impressed
by programs loading without any hourglass waiting, etc.

However, when it comes to storing your terabytes, it's still
the normal old fashioned hard drive.



A Few Major Projects To Start Out the New Year. . . .


1.  Web Pages Designed By And For Our Project Gutenberg Readers.

2.  Textbooks Are Becoming A More And More Highly Requested Item.

3.  Request To Help Complete Our Collection Of Andrew Lang Books.

4.  eBooks On Cellphones:  We Have Several Formats You Can Try.



1.  Web Pages Designed By And For Our Project Gutenberg Readers.


This would include other languages, web pages designed by and for
people of various ages from the youngest to the oldest, and, even
web pages designed around favorite subjects, favorite authors, or
even favorite books or characters.

Personally, I would LOVE to see web pages designed for readers at
various grade levels and then translated into many languages.



2.  Textbooks Are Becoming A More And More Highly Requested Item.


As more and more people spend more and more years homeschooling a
greater portion of modern kids, they are asking us for more books
to help teach any of the various subjects, from reading, writing,
and arithmetic, to geography and astronomy, to the dinosaurs, and
an enormous number of other subjects.

If you ever wanted to pass on your knowledge, now is the time and
the place, for books here last forever and cover the world.



3.  Request To Help Complete Our Collection Of Andrew Lang Books.


Many of you are familiar with the various "Color" Fairy Books, as
"The Red Fairy Book," by Andrew Lang, and a host of other colors,
but few of us have ever even seen a list of them all, including a
surprising number of books relating true events, etc.

If you find any Andrew Lang books, Fairy, Animal, True, etc., that 
we
don't have in our collection, please let me know, and we will help 
in
the process of completing this collection.



4.  eBooks On Cellphones:  We Have Several Formats You Can Try.


Let me know if you would like to help us set up our Cellphone pages
to bring more eBooks to more people in more of the world.


Don't forget to look at the iPhone stores, etc.  Gutenberg eBooks a
seller there.

Give The World eBooks in 2009!!!






New Project Gutenberg Landmarks and Headlines


300+ eBooks in Portutuese

400+ eBooks in Dutch


Just about to pass 500 eBooks in Finnish.



Please note that PrePrints now has dropped nearly 500 eBooks!!!

Of course they are still there, just "retired,"

So let us know if you want to try finishing any of those.

Well worth looking into:

http:www.preprints.readingroo.ms

We could use someone to write a piece about PrePrints.

We also need more help with the Chinese eBooks there.




The News In More Detail





Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!



FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the
Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems
and these were OEMed by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular
in a recognizable fashion because their snapon connectors
resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

We received two examples of RAM actually labeled "Flash,"
for the H-P 95 pocket DOS machine from 1991, and a sample
of Fairchild bubble memory, as well, from down under.

Thank you, Mate!

I have received two "Flash Series 2" PCMCIA cards and can
only hope to find a "series 1" some day for our demos.

Doesn't have to work, just for "show and tell."



POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.





Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and
totals from PG of Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

You should notice that we had a very good month, with 100
books done nearly every single week.


These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at

httpwww.gutenberg.cc

Where there are eBooks representing over 100 languages.



These are the various totals from the ~30,000 at

32,552   Grand Total [Counting those PrePrints]


Statistics watchers will note this is the second time we
have passed a Grand Total of 32,500.  This is as per the
major shuffle of Chinese and other books out of PrePrint
status on January 1, 2009, but which we are still hoping
someone will be able to make use of.

We still them all in the archives, just ask for them.


That was how we ended 2008.


Here is how we ended 2007

The combined PG projects had produced a total of 26,161 titles.


The most number of books posted...
  ...in one day was 65 on the 26th December
  ...in one week was 151 in Week 18 (week ending 9th May)
  ...in one month was 477 in November

We averaged
338 per month [Over 4,000 for the year]
  78 per week
  11.13 per day

99 titles were newly REposted to the new filing system, bringing us 
almost to

the 2,000 mark.
