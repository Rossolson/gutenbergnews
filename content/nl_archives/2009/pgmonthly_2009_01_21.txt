The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter, Jan. 21, 2009
eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


We are going to post an immediate transcript of Obama's
inaugural speech, which is going to make for a Tuesday,
and possibly a Wednesday, of major proportions.

So. . . .

I'm expecting a rather busy day the 20th, so I am doing
as much of the Newsletter half a day early as possible,
so be forewarned, some of the numbers may be a day late
or early, depending on how you look at things.


OK. . .that worked out and we have already had postings
of several versions of the speech with several more for
release in the near future.



Give The World eBooks in 2009!!!


47 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring
on December 21, 2012 [some now saying October 11, 2011]

Leaving 3 years 11 months, 15 2/3 seasons or 47 months.

Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions.




New Project Gutenberg Landmarks and Headlines



We added our 44th US Presidential Inaugual Speech.


Our Chinese eBook Library reached 400 titles overnight.




Project Gutenberg on Twitter


In a further step to creating a PG community beyond the core 
Gutenberg
websites, we have setup a Project Gutenberg account at twitter.com.

 
http://twitter.com/GutenbergNews


Any news or interesting info we come across relating to PG will get 
its
140 character Twitter announcement, so keep us posted.




The new goal is to put Spanish into our Top 5 list.

I desperately need some Spanish speaking people to help me!



We also officially passed 32,000 original Project Gutenberg
eBooks this past month, including all our usual listings.

This means the original Project Gutenberg editions now list
as many titles as the average U.S. public library.


Please note that PrePrints now has dropped nearly 500 eBooks!!!

Of course they are still there, just "retired,"

So let us know if you want to try finishing any of those.

Well worth looking into:

http:www.preprints.readingroo.ms

We could use someone to write a piece about PrePrints.

We also need more help with the Chinese eBooks there.




The News In More Detail





Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!



FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the
Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems
and these were OEMed by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular
in a recognizable fashion because their snapon connectors
resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

We received two examples of RAM actually labeled "Flash,"
for the H-P 95 pocket DOS machine from 1991, and a sample
of Fairchild bubble memory, as well, from down under.

Thank you, Mate!



POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.





Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and
totals from PG of Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

You should notice that we had a very good month, with 100
books done nearly every single week.


These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at

httpwww.gutenberg.cc

Where there are eBooks representing over 100 languages.



These are the various totals from the ~30,000 at

httpwww.gutenberg.org

and our other Project Gutenberg Sites

And From Project Gutenberg Sites Worldwide

27,755   up   280  PG General Automated Count
  1,728   up     5  PG of Australia
    565   up    12  PG of Europe
  2,013  DOWN  481  PG PrePrints, Reserved [42],etc.
    222   up    20  PG of Canada, Estimated.
======
32,283  DOWN  164  due to PrePrints and Reserved fixes

[However, we will be replacing the missing 448 or so,
which are still available to work on, with 2,000 more
of Prof. Mao's Chinese eBooks, etc., in PrePrints.]


>From last month


27,475  +   287    PG General Automated Count
  1,723  +     6    PG Australia
    553  +    13    PG Europe
  2,494  +    33    PG PrePrints
    202  +    12    PG Canada  [Estimated]
======
32,447  +   349    by various automated counts and newsletters


Note  Without counting PrePrints, we are still about 30K,
and some of the new .lit collection will not make it under
our current rules of addition from PrePrints, and would be
deleted from PrePrints without moving to other listings.

The 307 Chinese eBooks in PrePrints will probably go, as a
team of our best Chinese workers says they are not worth a
lot more time to work on, etc.

Note  There are perhaps 100 eBooks not listed here
that are already in circulation from Project Gutenberg.

Note  PG Canada includes English, French, and Italian.



Here is how we ended 2008
