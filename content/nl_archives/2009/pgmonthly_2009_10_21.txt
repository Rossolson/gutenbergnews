The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter--Oct. 21, 2009

eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


38 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring
on December 21, 2012 [some now saying October 11, 2011]

Leaving 3 years 2 months, 12 2/3 seasons or 38 months.

Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions,
such as that there will be affordable petabytes [2021],
and enough eBooks to fill an entire petabyte around the
same time.



Headline News [and lots of it!]


Cell Phone Figures for Q3 of 2009 are out


1.2 Billion Cell Phones Sold in Last Year

20 Million iPhones

versus

1.3 Million Macs


We are going to need a new site for cellphones!!!!!!!


WE NEED VOLUNTEERS TO CREATE

http://www.gutenberg.org/mobile


[Footnote:  If we presume 4.8 billion total cellphones
accounts in operation in the last year. that means 1/4
of all cellphone users got new phones last year.  This
constant upgrading is something I predict will keep us
on a rapid increase in cellphone functions, including,
but not limited to, books, calculators, browsers, etc.
I heard on NPR this week that more persons read eBooks
on cellphones than on computers or anything else.]



1800th eBook From Project Gutenberg of Australia
 400th eBook From Project Gutenberg of Canada



35,000th Project Gutenberg eBook From All Of Our Sites


As you know, two Newsletters ago we announced 25,000th
in our collection of eBooks in English then last month
we announced our 30,000th in all languages":  counting
those created or distributed under U.S. Copyright Law.

This month we are are announcing the 35,000th eBook of
all the various Project Gutenberg sites worldwide, and
this includes Australia, Europe, Canada, etc., and the
PrePrints section, which still has ~2,000.

In addition we are announcing our 1,500th French eBook
which is coming out at any moment, and de Toqueville's
major work on "Democracy" is the one we have chosen.

[At the moment of this writing the last polishing work
is being done on all four volumes, and we have 1493 in
our French collection already, so any moment now.]

Previous details on these are included below.



eBook Milestones Redux


We just released our 25,000th English Project Gutenberg
eBook as "Merriam-Websters Unabridged Dictionary, 1913"
about a month ago, and we are now coming up on 30,000th
in all languages, under U.S. Copyright Law and 35,000th
created by all Project Gutenberg sites worldwide.  This
is not counting any of the ~75,000 eBooks available via
http://www.gutenberg.cc which have been donated by many
eLibraries outside the Project Gutenberg systems.

In addition, Project Gutenberg of Australia is about to
post its 1800th eBook, and we are coming up on #1500 of
our eBooks in French.


Last month:  Project Gutenberg posted its 25,000th home-
grown eBook: home-grown means not including eBooks given
by the various Project Gutenbergs that are springing up,
including Australia [approaching 2,000], PG of Europe is
approaching 650, PG of Canada's approaching 500 and many
more such events are taking place around the world.

All in all, adding up all the Project Gutenberg sites in
toto, not discount duplications, there are 100,000+ book
titles, along with music, movies, audiobooks, etc.

All in all the original Project Gutenberg has produced a
total of 29,660 at the time of this release, meaning the
their total in all 50+ languages they have produced will
be turning 30,000 in about a month.

This larger total includes nearly 1,500 books in French,
about 600 in German, 500 in Finnish, over 400 in Dutch &
Chinese, about 350 in Portuguese, and 250 in Spanish and
the list goes on and on.

If it is languages other than English that interest you:

http://www.gutenberg.cc

where there are over 100 languages represented in a wide
variety of languages and subjects, with about 75,000 all
total, approximately half of which are non-English.

Our 30,000th eBook created under U.S. copyright law is a
beautiful volume on birds, lavishly illustrated.

Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!


FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The ideal piece around which to center this collection is
one of the 8 megabyte USBs.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the
Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems
and these were OEMed by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular
in a recognizable fashion because their snapon connectors
resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

We received two examples of RAM actually labeled "Flash,"
for the H-P 95 pocket DOS machine from 1991, and a sample
of Fairchild bubble memory, as well, from down under.

Thank you, Mate!



POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.





Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and
totals from PG of Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at

httpwww.gutenberg.cc

Where there are eBooks representing over 100 languages.

As you may have noticed, I cheated by a few days on the
date of this Newsletter so I could include #25,000 so I
should warn you that the monthly totals will be larger,
this month, and smaller next time.
