Project Gutenberg Ends One Year And Starts Another

Noon, January 6, 2010, is the end of our calendar production year
number 39 and the beginning of our 40th year, though our 40 years
of calendar time won't be complete until July 5, 2011.  This date
is due to our previous calendar being a weekly one running from a
Wednesday noon to the next Wednesday noon.  Once someone else has
taken over the Newsletters, they are welcome to change this to an
alternate date such as midnight January 1, but I was always awake
and working at noon, and able to send out weekly newsletters so I
just did what worked on that schedule.




Hot Requests


We need lawyers in the following fields:


Probate

Contract

Copyright


We also need people who can help make our web pages better for an
ever increasing number of people surfing in on cellphones, and in
different languages.  We will give you all you need to design and
implement your own Project Gutenberg web pages.  Who knows, it is
possible you could start a whole famous web page design career.

Public Domain Day

The first day of the years is Public Domain Day, when we list the
works that would have gone into the public domain that day if not
for the most recent two copyright extensions [but don't forget we
have had more extensions from the original 14 years].

Notable items that would be public domain now:

Fahrenheit 451
Walt Disney's Peter Pan
The First James Bond Book
Early books by Saul Bellow, Arthur Miller, Leon Uris, Jas Baldwin
Watson and Crick's Original "Nature" Article on DNA
Salinger's Nine Stories
From Here To Eternity
Asimov's Second Foundation
Early works of Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, E.E. Smith, van Vogt
War of the Worlds
Julius Caesar [James Mason, Marlon Brando, etc.]

Before these last two major copyright extensions renewals were of
legal necessity to double the length of copyright terms, and most
works were never renewed:  15% of all copyrights, 8% of books had
never been renewed, meaning the vast majority of everything under
copyright before 1982 would now be public domain.

These are great articles by a great copyright lawyer.




Milestones Of The Year


In 2009 we saw our 35,000th internally produced eBook go out, and
our 25,000 in English, our 1,500th in French, 600th in German and
500th in Finnish.  We also saw Dutch and Chinese pass 400 eBooks.

We still need to find ways to do more in Spanish and Portuguese.


These 35,000+ eBooks representing over 50 languages are at:

http://www.gutenberg.org



75,000+ Donated eBooks representing over 100 languages are at:

http://www.gutenberg.cc




100,000 Total Titles


In toto, counting the eBooks donated to us from other eLibraries,
individuals and schools at http://www.gutenberg.cc we now have in
well excess of 100,000 titles, though it is probably closer to an
even 100,000, given various duplications, etc.



Production Year Statistics


The numbers presented below will approximate what are recorded as
of noon on January 6, and the production year will be recorded as
running last year from Wednesday, January 7, 2009 through January
6, 2010, and the coming year will end on January 5, 2011.

Thus we had 52 Wednesdays this past year for 364 days; every once
in a while we get 53 production weeks on this calendar, which has
to be one reason for eventually changing it.
