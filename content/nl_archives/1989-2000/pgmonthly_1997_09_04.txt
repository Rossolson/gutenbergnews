Announcing Etexts #997 to #1036


"Never,
in the field of literature, have so many owed so much to so few."


First things first. . . .

THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To all those who have volunteers help to Project Gutenberg, over
more than a quarter of a century and especially to the anonymous
volunteers [at least anonymous for now], and to those who worked
VERY hard with me over the past few days [not to mention months]
to get us from Etext #900 to Etext #1,000 on schedule.

You can be a Project Gutenberg volunteer,  email hart@pobox.com.

You might be interested in taking a look at next week's issue of
Time magazine in the Time Digital Section in Point/Counterpoint.
You can see me in my cap and gown holding a stack of 1,000 CDROM
disks that will be able to hold 10,000,000 Etexts in the new DVD
format.  With compression I am told it could be 20,000,000 Etext
files, which would be more books than any library contains.  The
University of Illinois library, in which this picture was taken,
contains only 10,000,000 items in all its branches and is one of
the largest half dozen libraries in the United States.

*

Yes, in rereading this I realize I write in sentences that would
be considered too long by today's standards; please bear with me
as much as possible on this occasion which is quite possibly the
pinnacle of my career [unless we get massive new support we will
not be able to double our production per year ever again].

>From our humble beginnings with a single copy of the Declaration
of Independence of the United States now exactly 315 months ago,
the goal of Project Gutenberg has always been to demonstrate how
computers should create a Neo-Industrial Revolution/Renaissance,
through the efforts of a moderate number of people multiplied in
a nearly infinite manner by the power of computers to copy books
with incredible ease, once they are entered into digital formats
readable by common persons with common computers and programs.

Since that day on July 4th, 1971, when there were ~100 people on
the entire Internet, which had just started reaching out from an
infancy of a handful of U.S. West Coast mainframes, each with an
approximate power of modern calculators selling well under $100,
the invention of the personal computer for the common persons by
Woz and Jobs [Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, who eventually would
become known as Apple Computers Inc.] has changed the face of an
electronic generation for the rest of history.

On that very July 4th, 1971, we had to predict the onset of what
would come to be known as the "personal computer" and little did
we know that the Apple II would hit the market before the end of
the 1970's and we have been thankful to Woz and Jobs, Bill Gates
and Gary Kildall & all the other pioneers of personal computers.
The personal computer was a indispensable requirement for us who
wanted to bring a collection of great books to millions/billions
of people around the world.

At that time United States copyright was 28 years, with possibly
28 more years, if certain legal conditions were met.  Most works
were never renewed, so by 1978 we would have been able to print,
so to speak, most works published before 1950.

However, this was also the heyday of the xerox machine, and they
were not going to sit idly by while a new generation of machines
allowed easy copying of nearly anything in two dimensions.  BUT,
instead of trying to enforce the copyright laws, they broke them
by extending all copyrights to 75 years, and eliminating renewal
requirements, much as what had happened in the early 1900's when
the new steam and electric printing presses had made printing so 
inexpensive that Sears could afford to send catalogs to millions
of people for whom this would be the first book they ever owned.

Thus, to drive these new, more efficient publishers out of THEIR
business, the old line publishing lobby talked the U.S. Congress
into to voiding the copyright laws that had stood since founding
the United States, and doubling copyrights from 14 years, with a
possible 14 year renewal, to 28 years, with 28 year renewals.

*THOSE WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF HISTORY ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT IT!*

Every single time a new publishing technique has promised to get
the common people a home library, laws have been passed to stop,
dead in its tracks, this kind of "Information Age."

>From the first copyright laws, which were designed to eliminate,
most successfully I might add, the presses which were originally
started by Johannes Gutenberg in 1455, to the next generation of
copyright laws designed to eliminate, again most successfully, a
rash of "home libraries," published less expensively than modern
[early 20th century] publishers wanted to compete with, to xerox
revolutions and revolutionaries, which were legally stifled by a
new copyright law in 1976, to the most current copyright bill in
the U.S. Congress, which threatens to remove yet another million
books from the public domain because modern day publishers would
be unable to compete with electronic publishing today.

*AT THE START OF THIS CENTURY COPYRIGHTS WERE 14 YEARS, NOW THEY
*ARE THREATENING TO SURPASS 100 YEARS, A PERIOD LONGER THAN WILL
*BE LEGAL FOR ANY CONTRACT TO BE SIGNED FOR [this is why Panama,
*Hong Kong, etc., were leased for just under 100 years].

Information Age???

For Whom???

We hope it will be for you.

Gutenberg in Portugal and Brasil

Project Gutenberg now has the following mirror site in Portugal,
and a site in Brasil is under construction.  We would VERY much
like to open more sites south of the equator.  If you know some
places we could ask, please let us know.

gutenberg.esoterica.pt
ftp.esoterica.pt/dir?mirrors/gutenberg
ftp.esoterica.pt/gutenberg
ftp.esoterica.pt/pub/mirrors/gutenberg
gutenberg.esoterica.pt/pub/mirrors/gutenberg
ftp.esoterica.pt/pub/mirrors/gutenberg


A note of interest for potential Project Gutenberg volunteers:

XEROX INTRODUCES SCANNER-PRINTER-COPIER FOR HOME USE
Xerox is introducing a $499 machine that combines scanning, printing, and
copying capabilities with easy-to-use software.  Industry analysts don't
expect rival manufacturer Hewlett-Packard to incorporate color scanners
into its products before next Spring.  (New York Times 18 Aug 97)


You can get the Project Gutenberg books via FTP and the Web:

This is only available on the Russian language side of
their system, but is pretty easy to see.  Click on the
WINDOWS icon at the bottom of the main menu.  Then, on
the lower left selection [the web names will pop up in
English] which is /books.  The first one of that list,
The Palms Russian Public Library, is Project Gutenberg
