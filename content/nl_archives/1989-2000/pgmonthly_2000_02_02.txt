Subject: February Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: "Project Gutenberg mailing list" <gutnberg@listserv.unc.edu>
Date: Wed, 2 Feb 2000 07:57:23 -0600 (CST)


*This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for *Wednesday, Feb 3, 2000*
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy


This is a lightly revised release of last week's Newsletter, with some
changes to the format, to be in our normal order, as far as we can and
to include some announcements, requests, etc.

To make this editing easier, I will put these announcements, requests,
at the end of this message.


These are about:

Translating Hesse's Siddharrtha into English. . .we DO have this in an
already prepared GERMAN file, titled 7sidd10.* and .zip, and I will do
what I can to get them into the listings ASAP, but you should be able,
I hope, to get them via FTP, shortly after you receive this. . . .  mh

A program to automate the "less" file reader.

And a change to one of our Project Gutenberg mirror sites.

***

I am editing this remotely from Romania, so please forgive errors, and
the marigination and spelling will probably not be as good.


If anyone familiar with our Newsletters and GUTINDEX files should care
to neaten tjhis up for me even more, and send it back to me, it should
help me a lot when I get home this weekend.

Changes to etexts:

For German etexts, filenames starting with 8 are 8-bit versions,      
which should be usable by nearly all modern computers.  7-bit versions     
are plain ASCII (no accents or special characters).              
                                             
A "1" or "2" for the same etext number indicates a multi-volume set,  
as in 7wml1xxx.xxx and 7xml2xxx.xxx.

From John Mark Ockerbloom:

Due to an imminent disk space crunch on tom.cs.cmu.edu (which I can't
do anything about directly, no longer being at CMU)
I've moved over my Project Gutenberg
multiplexer to our local machine.  Any URL starting with

  http://tom.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/book/lookup?num=

can start with

  http://digital.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=

instead.  The old URLs will also continue to work,
at least until the disk at CMU fills up.

I don't know if this will be a permanent move or not (I'd really
like to get the multiplexer maintained by PG rather than by me)
but it will work for now (and if the tom.cs.cmu.edu links break,
an automatic search-replace can change all your links over to the
new form fairly quickly.)

Sorry for the sudden changeover, but it looked like something needed
to be done fast, and I wanted to give people with Web indexes a heads-up.

A quick note about an automatic "page turner" for the "less" program.


OK, well the webpage will be at:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~sjk98/sw/evenless


It is still very early stages, I mailed the author of `less', and he
thought of a possibly better way to do this, but I have a working
version that is very useful to me, and will put that up in the page.

So, thats the URL, and I will keep it updated with what happens.

The Project Gutenberg German team has taken on a
significant translation effort.  Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha
has cleared the copyright boundary and we are converting
the 1922 edition in the original German.  This work will be
finished shortly and will become available for proofreading
soon.

But the really exciting part is the flipside translation
into English of this book.  Yes, we know it has already
been translated, but those publishers hold very recent
copyrights to the English portions that won't be released
for a long time.  So we will do our own translation!

We need your assistance to get this done.  We have
established a web page to manage this work-in-progress. 
Volunteers are asked to check in with us for an assignment
so we know who is working on what and not overly duplicate
efforts.  Assignments run two pages at a time.  Contact
Stefan Langer (sl99@gmx.de), Amy Coulter
(acoulter@teleport.com) or myself
(globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com) for details and to get
started.

You can preview the work already done by using your web
browser to go to the web page
http://www.fortunecity.de/lindenpark/wallhalla/245/hesse/translation.htm

We look forward to working with you on this!  This will be
fun indeed!!

Because of the increased interest in our other listservers,
I am including the subscription information about all. . .


***

You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

Remember, sometimes Dr. Internet and Project Gutenberg share lists
for mailing. . .so you may sub or unsub to both without knowing.

There are now three Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers are two
of them, and the third is for announcments for the general public. 
Those of you who want the highest "signal to noise ratio, i.e. the
fewest number of messages containing the most information may want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" lists; just 
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]--
In addition we have opened an "unmoderated list" called "gutvol-d"
to which anyone may subscribe and post messages. . .we may have to
limit subscriptions to actual volunteers if we start getting spam,
but for now this will be a wide open list.

Rememmber:
"gutnberg" = General Public Announcements
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements
"gutvol-d" = Free For All Discussion
 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-l Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-d Your True Name
So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.


Thanks!!
