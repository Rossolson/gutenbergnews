This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter of Wednesday, September 6, 2000
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*

. . .So Far The New Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. . .
HAS NOT RECEIVED ONE SINGLE CENT. . .Please See Below For Details. . .

With 2870 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.48 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.
*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

This "cost" is down from $3.55 when we had 2820 Etexts on August 16
This "cost" is down from $3.60 when we had 2775 Etexts on August 2
This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2650 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts in April

Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by 52 cents???

There is no end to the great things we can accomplish
if we don't worry about who gets the credit.  - Anon.

If a free society cannot help the many who are poor,
it cannot save the few who are rich.  John F. Kennedy

Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
Albert Einstein

Life is an open book exam,
with no particular time limit.

I hate to lead with this, but if Project Gutenberg is going to be able to
eventually survive when I am gone, we have to get some support coming in.

Please. . .help us get started. . .I am going to conferences in the states
of Washington, Hawaii and California. . .and it would be nice if we could
solicit contributions in the process, but it costs money to file the papers
required before we can do this.  We CAN accept outside U.S. contributions.

Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in:
Texas, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota,
Iowa, Indiana, and Vermont. As the requirements for other states
are met, additions to this list will be made and fund raising will
begin in the additional states. These donations should be made to
the "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation" and mailed to:

I am typing in the book "Defenders of Democracy" which is a collection of
letters written around the time of the US entrance into WWI.  These
letters are from heads of state, literature figures, etc. encouraging the
woman at home in the US to support their husbands, brothers, and sons who
are going to war in Europe.  Several of the letters are in French and an
English translation is also printed.  I have typed in two of the French
letters with their English translations, but the French letters need
proofing.  Please contact me at bfish@atlantech.net if you can perform
this type of proof reading and I'll send you the completed letters for
proofing and additional letters as I get to them in the book.  THANKS!

Comments About Our New Files

We have posted our first three Etexts in Flemish!

This month we have approximately 2/3 of the October, 2001 Etexts done,
along with about 50% of the November, 2001 Etexts, and we completed an
extraordinary set of works by Alexandre Dumas that was reserved on the
schedule for August, 2001, as well as a few other Etexts we worked for
several months on, including the Dumas collection listed below.

We have 8 Galsworthy titles, and 19 T. H. Huxley titles for November.
for a total of 27 November, 2001 Etexts, and about 33 October Etexts.
Thus we have hopefully exceeded our goal of 50 at this time.  While I
am writing this I am also posting these books. . .so it is kind of an
interesting race as to how many books I can post before I get totally
exhausted. . .this is also the reason I sometimes make silly mistakes
while writing the last few parts of the Newsletter. . . .     ;-)

I am also hoping to [officially] squeeze in 10 extra Etext into those
November, 2001 listings, before I leave on my speaking tour, so #3000
can be announced while I am giving my speech in Hawaii.

BOEING PLANS IN-FLIGHT INTERNET SERVICES
Hoping to get a head start on its rivals, aircraft giant Boeing is
planning, to roll out an in-flight Internet and entertainment service to
air travelers by next year. The Connexion by Boeing service will be
delivered through a high-speed satellite wireless network that uses
specialized, phased array antennas to transmit data to laptop-toting
passengers who will pay $17.50 an hour for the privilege. Download rates
will be about 5 megabits per second, with upload speeds of 1.5 mps, or
about as fast as a T-1 line. Boeing is negotiating with various cable
channels, such as CNN, ESPN, Eurosport and Euronews, to fill the four
television channels that will be available on the system. "Trying to make
the time on the airplane more productive is really a tremendous feature
that will dramatically change the way people travel," says Boeing's P of
commercial information systems. (Los Angeles Times 28 Aug 2000)

IN U.S., DIGITAL HAVES OUTNUMBER HAVE-NOTS
The Internet continues to integrate itself into the day-to-day
routines of Americans, according to the results of a random
telephone survey of 65,000 Internet users by Nielsen NetRatings.
U.S. home Internet penetration reached 52 percent in July--the
first time more than half of all Americans had home Web access.
Home access rates jumped 35 percent from July 1999 to July of
this year, from 106.3 million home users to 144 million users.
Likewise, the time Internet users spend online is going up.  The
average Internet user spent 9 hours 41 minutes online this July
compared with 7 hours and 39 minutes last July, an increase
of 26 percent.  Internet users are also looking at fewer Web
sites, meaning that larger sites are successfully leveraging
their brand to hold users' attention.  Cheaper Web access is
enabling Americans to go online in ever-increasing numbers, says
NetRatings' Sean Kaldor. (Washington Post, August 24 2000)
