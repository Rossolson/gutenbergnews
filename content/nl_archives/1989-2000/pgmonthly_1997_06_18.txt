This is a very short Project Gutenberg Newsletter announcing June's Etexts

Our prairienet.org fileservers will be down for perhaps a week, starting
on Friday, so we had to get everything posted now, so they would get to
our mirror sites before the downtime.  Our other sites, listed below,
should have them all posted by Friday.

The Lost Pricess of Oz may be missing a page or two, if you have that
book in a paper edition, please let me know, and I will get more info.

I also need to hear from people who can help us proofread Dante in both
Italian and English.

Thanks so much,

Michael S. Hart
