Subject: Project Gutenberg Newsletter for November, 1997
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Sun, 2 Nov 1997 03:45:44 -0600 (CST)


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for Wednesday, November 5, 1977

Below are listed the 32 October PG Etexts, and 4 more to start November.
We will be releasing separate files of the Complete Works of Shakespeare
starting with Etext #1100 and continuing to approximately Etext #1137 to
release our previous single file Complete Shakespeare, as was requested.
We will also be releasing corrected versions of these files and versions
of Shakespeare from other editions in the near future.

Michael Hart will be hard to reach for most of November, please contact:
Dianne Bean and David Price, our Directors of Production, this month, to
get answers to your normal questions.  I am hoping for a deluge of xerox
copyright pages to work on over the holidays, as most of you know I have
a tendency to get a huge amount of work done just after Thanksgiving and
through the rest of the holiday season, so please keep my mailbox filled
with books we can do.  I can usually handle twice as many books over the
holidays, but sometimes there aren't that many to work on.

***

We have been experiencing problems with our listserver, so we are trying
to send this out now, on Sunday, November 2, so we will have time to try
another listserver on Wednesday if this fails.  The only listserver this
effects is the direct subscription to the "gutnberg@prairienet.org" one.
Many of the rest of you should receive this normally even if that list's
recipients do not.  If that one fails again, some of you may receive the
new copy on or after Wednesday, the 5th.

In other notes of interest, I spoke with the Dean of Computer Science of
Carnegie Mellon University, and apparently I should soon receive letters
indicating that Project Gutenberg should be able to continue to operated
from Carnegie Mellon University for three more years and I will continue
on as a Carnegie Mellon visiting scientist for that period.

Therefore, you will also hopefully shortly be receiving email requesting
that you put Project Gutenberg on your Christmas list; donations will be
made out to "Project Gutenberg/CMU", P.O. Box 2782, Champaign, Illinois,
61825-2782, the same as before.  If you do not receive this message, you
can hopefully get it by sending email to Dianne Bean, as above, who will
forward it to Greg Newby, who will be running our other listserver tries
while I am away.

A note below these Etext entries indicates that we are updating sites to
our new addresses, around the world, as the old "vmd" address we had for
so many years, will no longer forward to us after another month or so.

If you are still emailing us at any "vmd" address, please update address
books now, and let us know where sites are that contain the vmd address,
OTHER than uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu, and in the Etext files themselves.

Now, here are the 32 [actually 31] October Etexts, and 4 for November.

We hope you enjoy them.

This is our second experimental effort at cataloguing multiple
items in a single file.  In the first instance we use the same
index number for each item, and just used multiple entries for
that file in the index.  In this, the second instance, we have
used separate index numbers for the collection and for all the
entries in that collection.  Let us know which you prefer.  We
have traditionally used the smallest number of index entries--
as somewhat of a protest against others who have copied Etexts
and wanted it to appear as if they had more Etext than Project
Gutenberg or various other etext collections.  We want to make
our Etexts as easy as possible to find and work with, but, not
to "pad" our work.  However, we prefer to post short works for
you in collections, to eliminate you having to download all 11
kilobytes of our header and "legal fine print" to get files of
sizes less than the headers. Please email me on this.  Thanks!
Michael S. Hart, hart@pobox.com [Maybe something in between??]

My apologies, as the message below indicates; there are a number of very
old Project Gutenberg files scattered around the world and we appreciate
any efforts you could make to help us update them.  Many sites say their
location is the official center of Project Gutenberg, but the truth is a
real center of Project Gutenberg is a more or less mythical thing, as we
have always been an Unlimited Distribution concept, in which anyone will
be allowed to put up a Project Gutenberg site wherever they want as long
as it is non-profit.


Bringing Things Up To Date

As many of you know, Project Gutenberg is the oldest general
information provider on the Internet, having begun in 1971--
when there were only about 100 people on the whole Internet.
Since we allow our files to be reposted anywhere people want
to post them, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of sites
around the world containing our files. . .which we consider,
most whole-heartedly, the best way to provide Public Domain,
and other information, to the world.

However, as many of you Web users know, one of the problems,
probably the biggest problem, with the Web, is that no files
are updated in a given year on surprisingly large numbers of
Web sites, once they have been established.

Therefore, since many of our files date back many years, the
problem occurs that people read files such as "newuser.gut,"
from some of these sites, and receive information about some
of our email addresses and listservers that have been out of
date for years.

Right now, I would ask you to let me know the locations, and
filenames [other than the Etext files themselves, of course]
that we should make an effort to get replaced.  We realize a
number of these locations are not "active" in the real sense
of the word, but we can certainly make reasonable efforts to
at least update the locations we can.

Many of these sites mention "vmd" addresses.  vmd has been a
discontinued service for quite some time now, and if looking
for "vmd" on these sites yields a "hit". . .other than in an
Etext file [which will be updated in a separate effort] then
we ask you to email the people at that site [and cc: us] for
the purpose of asking them to update their files if possible
or to contact us if this can't be easily done.

Thanks for your help!

Happy Holidays to you all!!!

New sites "down under" are carrying the Project Gutenberg Etexts:

The Sydney PC Users Group was formed approximately 10 years ago
to cater to home computer users.  It has currently 2600 members,
prints a monthly magazine called "PrintScreen", & runs Special
Interest Groups (or SIGs) on various topics (OS/2, Windows,
Networks etc), runs a couple of local based groups and 3 BBSs
IBM (61 2 9804 8677), Gateway Mail Exchange (61 2 9984 8022)
and Macarthur (61 2 4628 3722).

Scanning Needed for Balzac Works
We have a volunteer interested in preparing English versions of Honore
de Balzac's works, but volunteers are needed to provide scanned files.
She'd like to begin with _Cousin Betty_, _The Chouans_, _The Wild Ass's
Skin_, or _About Catherine de Medici_ but is prepared to work on others
if they are more readily available. If you can help scan in some of the
materials, please contact Daphne Schor <dschor@erols.com> for details.

I wanted to inform you that Gutenberg-DE (Germany) has moved. The page
you are linking to still exists but it's no longer the home site. The
new URL is http://gutenberg.aol.de (Yes, AOL is sponsoring them!) Thanks

AAP INTRODUCES ELECTRONIC TAGGING SYSTEM FOR INTERNET
The Association of American Publishers, in cooperation with the Corporation
for National Research Initiatives, has developed a "digital object
identifier" system that would make it easier for would-be users of
electronic information to find out about the origin and ownership of the
online material, and about copyright restrictions on its use.  The voluntary
system would enable users to "recognize intellectual property even on the
fastest of highways," says a consultant who helped develop the system.  The
system is designed around a numeric tag that would be embedded in books,
articles and even chapters.  When users clicked on an icon, they would be
transported to the information owner's home page, which would contain
information for obtaining permission to use the work.  The system would be
maintained by a new, nonprofit D.O.I. Foundation, supported by fees from
publishers.  (Chronicle of Higher Education 3 Oct 97)

There are many sites around the world containing Project Gutenberg Etexts,
only two of which we actually maintain directly:  prairienet.org and also
archive.org.  uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu mirrors prairienet at 3AM & 3PM, and
is a much faster site.  You may find that some of these sites are faster,
much faster, from you location, but you may also find that some sites are
easier for you to use, depending on how you like to search our collection
of electronic book.  Of course, you can always download GUTINDEX.* files,
and do you own searching with your own favorite program.  That's my way!!
But many people really like the indexing and added information available,
especially from promo.net and sailor, as below.


You can get the Project Gutenberg books via FTP and the Web:

[This site is in Urbana, Illinois, and is quite fast]
ftp uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu or ftp 128.174.5.14

cd pub
cd etext
cd gutenberg
[or just cd /pub/etext/gutenberg/etext97]

get filename  (be sure to set bin, if you get the .zip files)
get more files
quit

password:  yourlogin@your.machine.domain
[this is your email address where you are]

We are working on several sites "down under" in Australia,
here is a note for those near Sydney.

The Sydney PC Users Group was formed approximately 10 years ago      
to cater to home computer users.  It has currently 2600 members,
