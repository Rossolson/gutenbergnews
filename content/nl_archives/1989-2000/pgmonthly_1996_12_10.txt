Books Index update from #737 to #750.

As has been the case for several years now, I try to publish something of
particular interest on the anniversary of the death of my father.

I have received permission to dedicate Project Gutenberg Etext #750 to Professor
H. H. Hart, today, December 10, 1996 on the 7th anniversary of his death.
He was instrumental in bringing Project Gutenberg to an even wider audience
than I could have.

Thanks Dad! The High History of the Holy Graal is for you. . .

Michael
