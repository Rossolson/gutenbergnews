Subject:      October Newsletter

*This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for October 31, 1992*
Our Goal, To Give Away One Trillion Etexts By December 31, 2001

*[10,000 titles to 100,000,000 people equals 1,000,000,000,000]

If each book goes to 100 million people by the end of 2001 then
we should be at about 3.5 billion with release of the following
not counting pre-1991 releases:  which are still in the process
of being dug out of our archives, new headers attached, and new
placement in new directories on our new 600M fileserver.  Thank
you NeXT, for your support!  Thanks also to Apple, Calera, CTA,
and Caere.

Save the instruction below, as some locations have changed!

The October 1992 Project Gutenberg Etexts are:

Oct 1992 The Legend of Sleepy Hollow (sleep10x.xxx)
Oct 1992 Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde #1  (hyde10xx.xxx)
Oct 1992 Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde #2  (hydea10x.xxx)

This choice was made by popular demand for this date.

The remainder of our responses to your letters will be contained
in the mid-month Newsletter2.

can't
answer queries about nameservers or how your local system runs
FTP!!

prepared
to deal with sending items through the mail.

Brief instructions are followed by more detailed instructions.
