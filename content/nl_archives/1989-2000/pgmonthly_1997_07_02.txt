Our email is back up, but our FTP is still iffy. . .see below.


26th Anniversary Edition of the Project Gutenberg Newsletter

July 4th 1971 to July 4th 1997:  nearly 1,000 Etexts online.

We have chosen Howard Pyle's "Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"
as our 26th Anniversary edition, and are still working madly
on Dante's Divine Comedy in Italian and several English text
translations for our 1,000th Etext, which should be released
officially on September 1st.

This is going to be quite an effort, anyone who has not been
in touch with me lately about it, please contact me again.


WIRED magazine's July issue listed Project Gutenberg as part
of their 40 year timeline of the most important events in an
extensive "informed projection" of the causes and effects of
the events of the 40 years surrounding the year 2000 in four
pages of foldout between pages 122 and 127.  The listing for
Project Gutenberg is near the top center of the four pages--
this is a very impressive list to be included in.  **Blush**
[I don't blush that often, but this is impressive! company.]


LOST EMAIL!  If you haven't heard from me, see below.

As announced two weeks ago, Prairienet was down last week to
make upgrades, and I have replied to all of the over 1400 of
your emails that I received over that period, but I know the
fact is that a lot of email is in the bit bucket in the sky,
as our sysadmins put it, so if you have not heard from me, a
resend will be necessary. . .sorry for the hassle.

Our email is now functioning normally but our Prairienet FTP
sites are still not working, none of them, so you would have
to get the files from alternate sites, listed below.

If you are SENDING us files, please use mrcnext right now or
trixie, if mrcnext is down.

We still need more people with SCANNERS. . .please email our
Director of Production, Dianne Bean <beand@pr.erau.edu> if a
scanner is available to you.

We need to find a copy of:
Sir D'arcy Thompson's "On Growth and Form"
1917 Cambridge University, or reprint.
"Geoffrey F. Pawlicki" <geof@netcom.com>
