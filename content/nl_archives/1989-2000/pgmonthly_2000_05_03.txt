Headline News

Is it true that 60% of the world population
has never made a phone call?

About twice as many [64%] Asian-American families use the Internet,
as the national average of all families [33%], which should include
the Asian-American families. . .so the difference is even greater.

97% of Chinese households have television, 88% for refrigerators.

Since 1956 US service workers have outnumbered blue-collar workers.

100 rupees [$2.34] buys 50 channels of cable access in India,
this is equal to one day's wages for a rickshaw peddlar.
10 years ago there was just one part time government channel.
No four lane intercity highways in India.
India is currently undergoing the worst drought in 10-100 years.
Some areas have been suffering from poor rainfall for 3-4 years.


About half the world population now lives in cities.
There are about 15 cities with 10,000,000 population.

In 1950 New York City handled about 20% of the US sea
shipping, now down to only 6% of the nation's tonnage.

A million Yellow Taxi trips per day in New York City.

New York is NOT one of the 15 cities of 10,000,000.

"Kampung Buku Malaysia (Malaysia Book Village) is a manifestation of the Kedah
State Government's ( a state in Malaysia) initiative in promoting reading to
the people of Malaysia. Through the book village, we hope to make available
cheap reading materials through the sales of second and remainder books.
However, as part of the Worldwide Book Village and Book Towns Movement,
we also sell antiquarian and rare books.

"We believe that our aspirations in bringing reading materials to the public
at large will be further enhanced through Etext under Project Gutenberg.
We, at the Book Village are making efforts to spearhead PG in Malaysia
and South East Asia (Malaysia. Singapore, Indonesia & Brunei),
to publish Etexts in the Malay Language. We will, in our endeavor
try to recruit retired librarians, government servants, students,
historians, government and non-government bodies to volunteer
in this wonderful program.

MICROSOFT TO ADOPT BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGY
[See Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon for details,
but be forewarned, there is no ending to the book.]
Microsoft says it plans to incorporate biometric technology in its Windows
software that will enable users to sign on by brushing their fingertips
across a scanner rather than typing in a password. Biometric technology
scans the details of a person's fingerprints, iris patterns, facial
structure or other physical characteristics and compares them against a
database of stored user information. The company will use authentication
technology from I/O Software Inc. (Reuters/Los Angeles Times 3 May 2000)

WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? DISNEY, SAYS TIME WARNER
Three and a half million homes cable customers across the U.S. were shut
out of ABC affiliate TV stations Monday as a result of a dispute between
Time Warner Inc. and The Walt Disney Co. The two media giants have been
negotiating for several months to form a new long-term agreement for Time
Warner's cable systems to carry channels from Disney, including ABC, the
Disney Channel and ESPN. Disney wants Time Warner to feature two new
channels and to make the Disney Channel part of its basic package. Time
Warner agreed but balked at the price and dropped affiliates in New York
City; Los Angeles; Houston; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Toledo, Ohio; parts of
Fresno, Calif., and Philadelphia. Each company blames the other for the
stalemate, witha Disney executive blasting, "Some deranged individual has
deprived all of these people of ABC. These people are arrogant
manipulators." A Time Warner spokesman says Disney is trying to extract
"excessive and unreasonable terms" for its cable TV channels. Until the
matter is settled, viewers are tuning into "Who Wants to be Millionaire"
the old-fashioned way -- by fiddling with their antennae.

WEB PORTALS RETHINK THEIR BROADBAND PROMISES
[Big Bandwidth is so far 98% vaporware. . . .]
Faced with the reality that only a relative handful of Web surfers have
access to high-speed 'Net connections, portal sites Yahoo and Lycos have
quietly scaled back their plans for new applications and content designed
specifically for those users. Spurred by the merger of Excite.com with the
@Home Network last year, Lycos began development of a service dubbed "Lycos
Lightning" aimed at high-speed surfers. But that initiative has been moved
to the back burner, as has a similar effort by Yahoo. "We look at the
marketplace and say, 'Well, broadband certainly is important, but there's
50 narrowband connections still in the United States for every broadband
connection, so let's be careful about how much energy we put into
broadband,'" says one Lycos exec. Despite broadband's limited availability
today, analysts expect high-speed connections in the U.S. to reach as many
as 12.9 million households in two years. When that kind of critical mass is
reached, site operators will have no choice but to play to the broadband
market. (New York Times 1 May 2000)

INTERNET TELEPHONY IS COMING INTO ITS OWN
[You can read about this in Cryptonomicon, too.]
If you think Internet communication is limited to e-mail and instant
messaging, think again. Last year, Internet Protocol (IP) networks carried
2.7 billion minutes of phone calls worldwide, and International Data Corp.
says that number could jump to 135 billion minutes by 2004, with nearly a
quarter of that usage occurring in Asia. One company hitching its wagon to
the IP telephony star is OCen Communications. OCen -- which stands for open
communications enterprise network and means "profound telecommunications"
in Chinese -- has built a private IP network linking Los Angeles to Asia,
enabling customers in California to place IP voice and fax calls to Japan,
South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and eastern China. Now, the company
plans to sell its services to corporate customers in Asia for resale to
consumers. Thought OCen faces a slew of competition from Internet phone
carriers, it's the first to target the Asian business community, where
quality is more of a factor than cost. Other IP phone companies have made
price their big selling point. OCen is offering customers what amounts to a
virtual private network -- ensuring high-quality service and four-digit
dialing between company locations, even when those locations span several
national borders. (Los Angeles Times 1 May 2000)

CAN SCRATCH 'N SNIFF COMPUTERS BE FAR BEHIND?
[You heard it first from me. . .hee hee]
Shopping online for a Mother's Day gift and can't decide which perfume to
choose? Not a problem any more. TriSenx has patented a technology that will
let you click and smell. Using a device something like a desktop printer,
you can download a smell or taste from the Internet. A picture of a
strawberry, for example, both smells and tastes like, well, a strawberry.
The scent technology, which several companies have been working on, works
by mixing chemicals to create the desired smell. The scents are printed on
a cardstock paper now, but future plans call for them to print to a
communion-like wafer that would make it easier to sample tastes from the
Web. Will it catch on? At its current price of $398, skeptics abound. "If
it's going to be a couple of hundred bucks I'd be hard-pressed to see who's
going to go out and buy a smell generator," says one analyst. Numerous
businesses have expressed interest in the idea, including fragrance makers
and cookie companies. (San Jose Mercury News 1 May 2000)

NEW EU ENCRYPTION EXPORT RULE LOOSER THAN U.S.
The European Union has agreed to relax the rules for exporting encryption
software, lifting almost all restrictions on encryption exports among the 15
EU countries and 10 other countries -- the U.S., Japan, Canada, Switzerland,
Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland -- which
together make up over 80% of the world market. The new EU rules eliminate
the need to secure approval from national licensing bodies and do away with
security checks for all encryption products with the exception of so-called
crypto-analytic tools, which can be used to test systems and crack codes.
Companies will need only to promise that the end user of the encryption
product is in one of the 25 countries approved. Exports to countries outside
that group will be subject to current restrictions. The move puts U.S.
encryption companies once again at a disadvantage, despite a liberalization
of export rules that took effect in January. And although U.S. companies are
likely to respond by pushing for further reforms, it's not likely that the
government will oblige. (Wall Street Journal 28 Apr 2000)

LOSING INTERNET WEALTH AT INTERNET SPEED
Among the many technology entrepreneurs who have seen market gyrations cause
their stock holdings to plummet is MicroStrategy founder and chief executive
Michael J. Saylor, who made news two months ago when he announced that he
was putting $100 million of his personal funds into the creation of an
online university.  A MicroStrategy spokesman says that Saylor will continue
his plans to make that donation, even though the market value of his
personal stake in the company has dropped from a high of $13.6 billion to
$1.07 billion at close of the market yesterday. (Washington Post 28 Apr 2000)

JUDGE WANTS HACKER OFF THE LECTURE CIRCUIT
[Is this EX POST FACTO as prohibited in the US Constitution?]
When he was released on probation after having been imprisoned almost five
years for network vandalism, Kevin Mitnick was ordered to stay completely
away from computers, cell phones, and the Internet for three years. The
judge, assuming that Mitnick would have to find some minimum-wage job,
didn't think of ordering him not to give speeches about his knowledge of
hacking. To rectify her oversight, U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer is
now telling him she'll send him back to jail if he doesn't get off the
lecture circuit. Mitnick says, "They're saying I can no longer write or
speak about technology issues. I think it is an abrogation of my First
Amendment rights... Probation is not supposed to be punitive...They don't
like the idea of my being a celebrity. They are trying to chill my free
speech in hopes that my notoriety will die down." (AP/San Jose Mercury News

JUSTICE APPROVES VIACOM-CBS MERGER
[More Merger Mania]
The Justice Department has okayed Viacom's $47-billion purchase of CBS, and
the Federal Communications Commission has indicated it, too, plans to
approve the megamerger. In its recommendation for approval, the FCC's Mass
Media Bureau  said the combined company should be given a year to comply
with the 35% audience limit and six months to sell off two radio stations or
a TV station in Dallas, in order to comply with media ownership rules. The
Bureau also recommended that Viacom-CBS be allowed to keep UPN for one year,
during which time the FCC likely will relax its dual-network prohibition.

MICROSOFT COUNTS ON TEEN WHIZZES FOR THE FUTURE
Microsoft has seen the future and it is young.  So it's hired two teenagers
-- Michael Furdyk, 17, and Jennifer Corriero, 19 -- to explain to Microsoft
executives the new generation's philosophy of work and play. "People's lives
used to be all about education, then work, then retirement or fun or
whatever," says Corriero. "But what's happening with us is that all three of
these things are all mixed in together. We're always learning, we like our
work so we're working more, and we're working when we want to, and we're
having fun now as opposed to later." One example of how things are changing
is that younger people seem to prefer online chat meetings as opposed to
conference room get-togethers. They feel they can communicate more
thoughtfully by writing, can work on other projects while waiting for a
response, and can walk away from the meeting with a written record of all
that was discussed. (AP/Los Angeles Times 27 Apr 2000)

COMPUTER GIANTS SEEK SAVINGS THROUGH B2B PARTNERSHIP
Taking their cue from "old economy" veterans who have formed
business-to-business partnerships to help reduce supply costs, three of the
top five computer companies -- Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway --
announced they have joined with nine suppliers to launch a new "online
marketplace company." The enterprise initially will be a catalog of
products from each participant and later will link buyers and sellers.
Eventually it's expected to speed up the design and manufacture of new
products and will include telecom and consumer electronics components.
Backers, who estimate savings will be between 5% to 7%, are actively
seeking other players, including Internet software and services suppliers.
Pioneer partners are chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Samsung
Electronics, Infineon Technologies, NEC Corp. and Hitachi Ltd.; disk-drive
makers Quantum Corp. and Western Digital; and printed circuit-board makers
Solectron Corp. and SCI Systems Inc. The new company is expected to be up
and running in 90 days. IBM announced it is developing a similar exchange.

SCI FI WRITER WINS PRIZE CREATED FOR ONLINE VISUAL ARTISTS
[No. . .I swear. . .I didn't get to this one until just now, didn't know!]
By-passing 250 official entries in the Internet category of the Prix Ars
Electronica international computer-arts competition sponsored by the
Austrian Broadcasting Company, the jurors gave the prize to science fiction
author Neal Stephenson ("Snow Crash" and "Cryptonomicon'), who didn't even
enter the contest and isn't even a visual artist.  One juror said
off-the-record: "It was a good way to make the comment that the work we were
seeing wasn't as original, and also to credit Neal Stephenson because he's
directly inspired so many developers." (New York Times 27 Apr 2000)

OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED AOL-TIME WARNER MERGER
The Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, the Center for
Media Education, and the Media Access Project will file petitions with the
Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission in
opposition to the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner, which
the groups say will add "a dangerous new dimension to the merging structure
of the cable TV-broadband-Internet industry." AOL and Time Warner say that,
to the contrary, the merger "will deliver tremendous benefits to consumers,
bringing people around the world more choice and more convenience and
accelerating the rollout of broadband services." (Washington Post 26 Apr 2000)

A number of Internet startups are creating voice portals that
allow users to access the Internet using a telephone rather than
a computer.  Users call a toll-free number and speak commands to
navigate the Internet.  Tellme Networks has built a voice portal
that allows users to choose from various categories of
information, including stock quotes, weather reports, and
restaurant and movie listings.  Using speech recognition
technology, the portal takes in a caller's selection, finds the
requested information online, and reads the information aloud.
Voice portal developers expect to eventually create voice sites
that users would navigate by speaking keywords.  The market for
using the phone to provide Internet access and direct users to
businesses could reach $5.5 billion, says Mark Plakias of Kelsey
Group.  Voice portals could help narrow the digital divide since
telephones are so widely available and easy to use.

EPA TO LIMIT WEB INFORMATION
[Beaten to death from both sides.]
The Environmental Protection Agency has decided that it will not
publish specific information on the Internet about toxic waste
sites and other dangerous chemicals residing in manufacturing
plants for fear that terrorists will use the information to
launch an attack.  The EPA had previously planned to make such
information public, but objections were raised by FBI and Justice
Department officials, who felt that the information could be used
by people with bad intent to facilitate an attack on a chemical
plant.  New EPA and Justice Department regulations will be
released today.  Omitted from the Internet will be information
relating to the size of the population surrounding chemical
plants, the type and breadth of a toxic cloud that could develop
if there were an accident at a chemical plant, and disaster
scenarios that could occur if such an accident took place.

A LAPTOP FOR EVERY KID
Four years after the principal of a Bloomfield, Conn., school
initiated an effort to supply all of its students and teachers
with laptops and wireless Internet access, other school systems
across the country are seeking to act on bold plans of their own
to provide their students with such technology.  In Maine, the
state legislature will vote this week on a proposal by Gov. Angus
King that would supply all of the state's 17,000 seventh-graders
with laptops, as well as the new seventh-graders of each school
year.  Although King wanted to use as much as $50 million of the
state's budget surplus to wire students, a compromise has reduced
that amount to $30 million, which would also be used to establish
a permanent endowment with its interest to be used to help buy
the computers.  In New York City, the board of education has
already voted to pursue an initiative that could fund laptop
purchases for every student in fourth grade and higher in nine
years.  With its April 12 unanimous vote, a school Internet
portal will be created, and the Web site will make money by
selling ads and licensing e-commerce sites.  New York's 1.1
million public school students will obtain e-mail service through
the portal. (Time, 1 May 2000)

COMPANIES, SCHOOLS DO MATH: TECH PAYS
The effects of the digital divide are perhaps most evident in
Silicon Valley, where high-tech workers are regularly becoming
millionaires while many non-tech workers cannot afford to pay
rent.  With local workers filling only two-thirds of high-tech
labor needs, the industry is losing $3 billion a year in
productivity and high salaries needed to keep workers, according
to the business, government, and education think tank Joint
Venture: Silicon Valley.  Although Silicon Valley is renowned for
technology, the region's schools are unable to meet demand for
technical classes because of poor funding and a lack of qualified
teachers.  Schools have had to cancel technology classes because
teachers, frustrated with low salaries, are entering the
high-tech field.  Some companies are trying to create a skilled
labor pool by providing training and equipment to local high
schools and community colleges.  Meanwhile, Joint Venture:
Silicon Valley urges local high-tech companies to send workers to
teach at community colleges to "spread the wealth" of Silicon
Valley. (Investor's Business Daily, 26 April 2000)
