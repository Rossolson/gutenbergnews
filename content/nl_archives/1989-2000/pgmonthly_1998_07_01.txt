This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for July 1998

Our 28th Internet Fourth of July! Congratulations to a
thousand volunteers who have helped us over the years!

[Usually delivered the first Wednesday of each month.]
[Major crashes this week, let me know if you have NOT!
received expected email from me, or if you did not get
this through the normal channels you usually get mail]

***

We are currently working on our first Etext to be sent
in both Chinese characters and in English translation.

It is the story of Mulan; for those of you who want to
use the movies to extend your children's reading, this
is a prime example. . .and to show that not all we see
originated in the language we see it in.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars In Etexts Yet???

This first week of July, 1998, marks the completion of
our 27th year of public information service on the Net
since we started on the 4th of July, 1971, with the US
Declaration of Independence, with a goal to present to
the public 10,000 Etext files for free downloading.  I
am proud to announce that our volunteers have just now
reached 1/7 of that goal, and that we hope we can post
enough more Etexts this year to reach 1/6 of 10,000.

Next year we hope to reach 1/5 of that goal, by giving
away Etext #2000 on or before January 1, 2000.

So. . .right now you would have to value each Etext at
$7, and presume the average Etext will reach 1.687% of
the world population to presume we have given away the
trillion dollars worth of Etexts that is our goal.

When the world population is 10 billion [only just now
reaching 6 billion, but I remember when it was 2.5] it
will only take reaching 1% of the population with that
mythical average Etext, and with 10,000 Etexts it will
only require a nominal $1 value per copy to say we had
given away a trillion dollars worth.

However, since no one else is even PRETENDING to do it
. . .we are still likely to be the first to say we had
a trillion dollar philanthropy project.

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]

Sorry for any problems.

You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]

 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.


Thanks!!
