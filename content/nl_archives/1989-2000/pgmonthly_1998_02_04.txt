This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for February, 1998


Milestones to consider:

Etext #1200 posted yesterday. . .possibly #2000 on 1/1/2000

10 years ago we were just posting Etext #12. . . .


We are considering moving to 36 books per month, and, would
like to have your input on this, as I consider this is YOUR
project. . . .  If we do 36 per month for the next 23 month
period, we should be able to reach 2000 Etexts by January 1
of the year 2000. . .however. . .I *am* aware that we would
be pushing things a bit, so I am going to give this at most
a one month trial period, so we can get some feedback.  The
Directors assure me that they have volunteers ready to go--
but I always like to check with out volunteers at large, b4
we change things.  I think it *would* be kind of nice to do
our 2,000th Etext during the big celebration. . . .

[I know that the Third Millennium really doesn't start that
year, but rather in 2001. . .since there was no year zero.]

Here are the 32 Etexts for January, 1998, and if we can get
enough more out in February, I will rename some of them for
January's extra 4 Etexts.  I pushed the envelope yesterday,
and in a fit of the workaholism I am somewhat famous for, I
posted 12 Etexts yesterday, as it is hard for me not to get
going hard when crossing a milestone such as Etext #1200.

The very earliest of our volunteers joined us approximately
10 years ago, when we had only about 12 Etexts in our small
collection. . .though not so small if you consider how long
it took to download them at 300/1200/2400 baud.

Today we have about 100 Etexts available for each Etext the
collection had 10 years ago.  If we can keep growing at the
same rate, we can have a library truly worthy of that name,
10 years from now.

I am not sure how well this is going to work out for me, as
I have been pretty much working as hard as I can for years,
and last year really wore me out.

However, if we can get just a few more volunteer editors in
English and a few other languages, we can do this.

We desperately need at least one editor in these languages:

French
German
Spanish
Portuguese
and other languages
[see list below]


We still need someone to help us create a "hit counter" for
relaying hits to other Etext sources, so they get credited.
This is VERY important for some of them to get grants, etc.


Meanwhile here are the 32 Etexts already posted for January
and below that the ones I posted yesterday for February, of
which 4 may be renamed as for January if we can get 36 more
Etexts on line before the end of the month.

You might be interested to know that Etexts 1198, 99 & 1200
each have their origins down under in Australia.  #2000 was
produced by Sue Asscher from down under in Queensland:  and
the other two are by Australian authors.

We are working hard to set up teams in the languages and/or
countries listed below this index.  We hope you can help!!!

***

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]

 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.
