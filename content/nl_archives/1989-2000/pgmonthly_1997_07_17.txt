Don Quixote is a long book, some 2 million characters, divided up into
over 100 chapters, and we desperately need all the proofreaders we can
possibly get to take a look at this file over the next few weeks.  The
proofreading can be done from any John Ormsby edition before 1922, and
SOME proofing can be done from later editions.

If you can possibly get your hands one of these paper editions we will
help you coordinate your efforts with others, unless you plan to do an
immense amount of work and try to proofread the whole thing.

What we are particularly interested in at first are just missing parts
. . .whole sentences, paragraphs, sections, etc., then more detail.  A
great value can be generated on this particular Etext by a quick look!

Any differences you see should be reported to me at hart@pobox.com and
your efforts will be coordinated by our Director of Production, Dianne
Bean at beand@pr.erau.edu

Thank you SO much for any effort you can put in on this.  I have spent
the entire morning working on this file, after a few days collecting a
wide variety of editions, etext information, etc.  We also hope to see
a few other editions in both English and Spanish very shortly to get a
Spanish Project Gutenberg Team into motion.

Right now I have to switch to Italian and English for the next dozen--
which will be versions of Dante's Divine Comedy.

Again my HUGE thanks to you all!
