Here are the 36 July Etexts for 1998.  The Federalist Papers tops the list to
commemorate the 27th Anniversary of the first Project Gutenberg Etext, the US
Declaration of Independence.  Since we are currently two months ahead of this
year's schedule, we are posting most of these books in June, so they would be
currently arriving at the best time for people to include them in some of the
4th of July celebrations, and also Bastille Day.  Therefore the month of June
will primarily be filled with "History of Democracy" Etexts, as was our first
10 years at Project Gutenberg.  We hope you will find them enlightening.

These Etexts are from  http://www.constitution.org/liberlib.htm
Our Thanks to The Constitution Society for Providing This Etext!

SENATE PASSES ONLINE COPYRIGHT EXTENSION
The Senate unanimously approved the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which
offers the same protection to online computer software, music, movies and
written works that they enjoy in more tangible form.  In a key provision,
the legislation exempts libraries and online services from prosecution for
copyright violations committed by patrons and customers.  Individuals who
violate copyrights for financial gain will be liable for $1 million in fines
and up to 10 years in prison.  (Wall Street Journal 15 May 98)

INTERNET GROWTH
A study by the U.S. Commerce Department ( http://ecommerce.gov/ ) says that
traffic on the Internet is doubling every hundred days and predicts that
electronic commerce will grow to $300 billion a year by 2002.  (USA Today 16
Apr 96)  [So. . .anyone who says they can make the Internet 100 time faster,
will have to deal with the fact that traffice with double as fast as they do
any doubling of the speed.  Don't expect any real speedups.    Michael Hart]

[Note Well:  This means traffice is multiplying by 10 every year. . . .
When you listen to those people promising to make the Internet run 100
time faster in 10 years, ask them if the Internet won't be slowing down
because they aren't proposing increasing the speed as fast as traffic.
None of them are saying they could possibly make the Internet handle
100 times more traffic every year. . . .  This is smoke and mirrors.

ECONOMIST PREDICTS Y2K PROBLEM WILL CAUSE RECESSION
In an op-ed piece, Edward Yardeni, chief economist and managing director of
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell says that problems arising from the Year 2000
computer glitch could cause a major recession, as businesses fail and
government agencies become incapable of delivering basic services, including
tax collection, welfare payments, national defense and air traffic control:
"The likely recession could be at least as bad as the one during 1973-74,
which was caused mostly by a disruption in the supply of oil.  Information,
stored and manipulated by computers, is as vital as oil for running modern
economies.  If information is harder to obtain, markets will allocate and
use resources inefficiently.  Market participants will be forced to spend
more time and money obtaining information that was previously available at
little or no cost...  Furthermore, a 2000 recession is bound to be
deflationary.  The U.S. may experience a $1 trillion drop in nominal GDP and
a $1 trillion loss in stock market capitalization."  (Wall Street Journal 4
May 98)  [and you heard it here first, years ago. . .mh]

NEW DOS IS YEAR 2000-COMPLIANT
IBM has launched a new PC DOS 2000 that automatically corrects the two-digit
dates that threaten to befuddle older computer systems, and also supports
the European Monetary Union's new euro currency symbol -- a management
problem that could prove even more troublesome for European businesses than
the Y2K problem.  According to recent research, there are between 120
million and 150 million people who still use DOS on their desktop machines.
"We believe about half of those are business users," says a manager at IBM's
Network Computing Software division.  That figure doesn't include users of
Microsoft Windows 3.1, which includes DOS as a component.  (InternetWeek 27
May 98)

This concludes the June Project Gutengberg Newsletter. . . .

Thanks so much for your continuing support!

You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]

 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.


Thanks!!
