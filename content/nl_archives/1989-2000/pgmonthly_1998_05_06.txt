And a few clippings from Edupage:

13 STATES TO FILE ANTITRUST SUIT AGAINST MICROSOFT
Thirteen states are preparing to file a joint antitrust action against
Microsoft to prevent the company from shipping its new Windows 98 operating
system software.  The attorneys general said they would rather have
coordinated a federal-state action against Microsoft, but that they were
concerned over the slower time frame within which federal government
operates.  Microsoft plans to begin shipping Windows 98 to computer makers
next month and to release it to the general public in June, and the states
felt taking any action after the PC makers began installing it on their
machines would be significantly more complicated.  Microsoft's VP for law
and corporate affairs says:  "This case involves a fundamental principle for
us, the freedom of high-technology companies to continue to innovate on
behalf of our customers.  Part of innovation has to be integration.  We are
going to continue to integrate products."  (New York Times 30 Apr 98)


DON'T BLOCK WINDOWS 98, SAY VENDORS
Twenty-six computer industry executives, including the chairmen of Intel
Corp., Micron Electronics, Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and
Hewlett-Packard, have signed a joint letter urging the Department of Justice
not to block the planned release of Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system.
"Interfering with the release of Windows 98 would drag down the entire
industry's efforts to deliver value to customers and returns to
shareholders," said the letter.  The executives were careful to point out
that they weren't expressing "any opinion on the merits of the investigation
of Microsoft."  The upgrade is expected to be shipped to computer makers in
mid-May and hit retail shelves on June 25.  "The bottom line is, no computer
manufacturer can afford to harm their relationship with Microsoft," says the
president of the Software Publishers Association.  "When Microsoft calls and
asks them to write a letter to Justice, they're hard-pressed not to."  (Los
Angeles Times 1 May 98)


U S WEST TO OFFER TV, INTERNET ACCESS OVER PHONE LINES
For a cost "comparable" to the monthly fees charged by Cox Communications
(the primary cable company in Phoenix), U S West plans to offer its Phoenix
customers a video and data services package via "variable digital subscriber
lines," or VDSL.  U S West says its service will include some 120 TV
channels and Internet access.  In the past year, cable companies have begun
to offer Internet access as part of their monthly service, and an analyst
with International Data says, "If you're a phone company, you're going to
want to roll out a package of services that will blunt the attack from the
cable companies, which are trying to take away phone customers." (Wall
Street Journal 20 Apr 98)

SCIENTISTS DEMO INTERNET EXPRESS LANE
Scientists at two national laboratories demonstrated a new "differentiated
service" technology that gives certain types of electronic data higher
priority for transmission over the Internet.  In the demo, two
streaming-video signals were sent -- one with a high-priority mark and one
without -- over an especially busy Internet route.  The video marked
high-priority arrived at a speed of eight frames per second, versus one
frame per second for the unmarked video.  Within a year, it may be possible
for research labs and universities that need more dependable Internet
connections to pay a higher cost for prioritized delivery.  (Chronicle of
Higher Education 1 May 98)

[This is something we have written about before. . .it basically is like
a railroad system in which efficiently sendable text files are held over
to sidings to wait for movies and sound files to pass on express lanes--
the idea is that it is more important to move huge audio/video files for
entertainment than to move books for education.  Huh??  Michael S. Hart]
