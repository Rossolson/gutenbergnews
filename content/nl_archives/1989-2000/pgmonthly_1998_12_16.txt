ORACLE, SUN TEAM UP TO RIVAL MICROSOFT
Oracle and Sun Microsystems are joining forces to develop new software that
would "take low-cost, easy-to-use Internet computing to a new level" while
at the same time competing head-on with Microsoft's Windows operating
system.  Internet computing, a term coined by Oracle, focuses on using
browser software as the interface to all other applications.  Oracle CEO
Larry Ellison also recently revealed plans to market a new version of the
company's popular database software that requires no operating system.
(Financial Times 14 Dec 98)


IBM'S PRESENT TO THE INTERNET
IBM is contributing to the momentum of the "open source software" movement
by freely distributing original ("source") code to a new e-mail program
called Secure Mailer which, like products such as "Sendmail," "Q Mail," and
"Microsoft Exchange," stores and forwards e-mail messages with a high degree
of security.  Computer security expert Abner Germanow of a prominent market
research firm says, "This is IBM's Christmas present to the Internet.  For
these are core pieces of software, and we're going beyond trying to make
money off of them, to the idea that by freely sharing them it will make the
world a better place."  (New York Times 14 Dec 98)
