Books Index update from #681 to #704.

Due to the fact that some are much larger than normal, we have also made
up a few that are smaller than normal to even things out a little.

Coming: The Fall of the Roman Empire, by Gibbon and
Interview with Bruce Sterling on his new book, Holy Fire.

Please see the accompanying note entitled Project
Gutenberg Needs You, for details.

Our Spanish readers may read about us in the latest issues of Information
World en Espanol, we are very interested in doing more books in more languages.

You may also want to keep an eye out in about a month for the article on
Project Gutenberg in the January issue of Wired.

Once again we have managed to present 32 files we hope will be of interest
to the general population. We have two more months scheduled for 32 per month--
then we hope to once again double our production, this time to 64 per month--
for each of the 12 months of 1997.

While this may appear as an incredible amount of work, the truth is that
your volunteers at Project Gutenberg have already spend several months doing
books at the rate of 64 per month, during the Spring of 1996 just to insure
that in 1997 we would be capable of accomplishing our goals.

However, while we were doing this, you may have also heard that most supports
for Project Gutenberg from the University of Illinois have been withdrawn
and what you may NOT have heard is that this has also been true of the support
we have been receiving from Benedictine University [Illinois Benedictine
College was their previous name], and also support from Walnut Creed CDROM,
who makes and markets the only official Project Gutenberg CDROM has also
been less of a support than in previous years.

A separate message requesting your individual, college, or corporate support,
is accompanying this Newsletter. . .if you are not interested just delete
it.

We currently have just about #700 volunteers, as is usually the case the
book number is approximately the same as the number of volunteers we have.
A 1997 production on the schedule we have managed to keep doubling every
year should be possible if we receive support on two levels:

1. We will need approximately 800 more volunteers if we are going to produce
800 more Etexts during 1997.

2. We will need approximately $2,000 per month to keep afloat as I am unable
to continue funding Project Gutenberg without financial assistance.

3. We could also use some public relations people, if we can get any for
the next year. We did manage to get one last year, but AOL stole her away.

I thank you all for your continued support of what I feel to be the very
best possible investment you can make in the world. Every book we produce
goes to millions, perhaps even hundreds of millions, of the 1.2 billion computers
out there in the world, and usually there is more than one user per computer.

Your single effort of putting your favorite book into electronic text formats
could change the lives of hundreds of millions of people. . .please help.

My HUGE thanks!
