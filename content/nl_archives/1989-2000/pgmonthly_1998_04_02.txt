This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for April and May, 1998

We were set to announce that we were 1/8 of the way to our Etext
#10,000 in this Newsletter, but things went so well this month a
new announcement is in order. . .instead of just reaching 12.5%,
we have reached 13% of our goal as of today, 50 more Etexts than
we had planned to announce today.

The Gutenberg Volunteers have really been on fire lately, with a
record number of 80 Etexts being posted during the last 31 days,
thus requiring a combined Newsletter containing all the titles--
including the two more we posted since the end of March.

There will be our usual "Project Gutenberg Needs YOU!" message--
sometime this month, then, hopefully, we will still be ahead for
getting May done, and thus post the June Newsletter in May.

*

We have versions of Madame Bovary, The Waste Land, and Chroicles
of Avonlea ready for proofreading. . .as per your requests, just
email me to get them.

*

We need to know who sent which files of Count of Monte Cristo,
so we can link up the proper copyright research to the files.

>From Edupage:

I WANT MY MINITEL!
Almost 20 years ago, France became the first networked nation with the
deployment of the Minitel, a low-tech terminal that citizens could use to do
everything from check the weather to order a pizza.  Now, the country's 35
million subscribers are loathe to give up their beloved Minitel and go
online with the Internet:  "The Minitel... could end up hindering the
development of new and promising applications of information technology,"
warned Prime Minister Jospin last summer, adding that France's technology
gap "could soon have dire repercussions on competitiveness and employment."
To bring the populace up to speed, Minitel owner France Telecom is planning
to deploy next-generation terminals that will access both Minitel and the
Internet, but French Internet-industry executives say such hybrid solutions
merely encourage users to keep thinking "Minitel," rather than "Internet."
"While we sit and worry about the Minitel and ways to get around it, we
could be throwing our whole future away," says one.  (Wall Street Journal 26
Mar 98)

COPYRIGHT SITUATION IN CHINA
Pirated videodisks of the movie "Titanic" were available throughout China
last November, a month before its release in U.S. theaters, and about half a
million pirated disks are smuggled into China every day from Macao.  Chinese
officials say there is little they can do about this blatant violation of
the intellectual property rights agreement that China reached with the
United States in 1995.  One official explains:  "The profits are so great,
they will take any risk.  They're like drug dealers.  It is very difficult
to arrange a crackdown.  You have to coordinate all these different
departments, the copyright publication department, the police, the
Industrial and Commercial Administration.  We take copyright violations very
seriously.  But when it comes to copying a disk, most Chinese people don't
see what's wrong."  And one merchant who sells pirated material insists:
"There's nothing wrong with selling pirated VCDs.  My son loves watching
them."  (New York Times 28 Mar 98)

CULTURE, NOT CURRENCY, MAKES A HAVE-NOT COUNTRY
Digital guru Don Tapscott says whether a nation remains a technology
"have-not" depends on its mindset, not its bank balance:  "It's not the poor
countries that are blocking progress.  It's countries that have a culture
that impedes innovation, that cannot find the national will to go forward
with technology.  What is it about a national culture that enhances
curiosity?  You need countries to have an environment where companies have
the potential to create wealth."  (Upside Apr 98)

"SPAMFORD" WALLACE AGREES TO STOP SENDING JUNK E-MAIL
Sanford Wallace (dubbed "Spamford" for his aggressiveness in "spamming" the
Internet with unsolicited commercial messages) to pay $2 million to settle
the last of several lawsuits brought by Internet providers against him and
his company, Cyber Promotion Inc.  Wallace indicated that legal battles have
"put Cyber out of the spamming business."  (New York Times 29 Mar 98)
