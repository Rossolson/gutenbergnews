With 4,376 eBooks online as of January 16, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.29 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

This "cost" is down from $3.17 when we had 3166 Etexts on Jan 17, 2001!

100,000,000 readers is about one and a half percent of world population!

Just 6 years ago, Jan 3, 1995, we announced eBook numbers 208 thru 215!

SATELLITE SIGN-UPS INCREASE; CABLE SLIPS SLIGHTLY
Cable television companies' share of the U.S. pay-TV market slid last year
from 80% to 78% as satellite TV companies increased the rate of customer
sign-ups by 15% from a year earlier, according to the Federal Communications
Commission. Cable customer sign-ups grew more slowly, up 1.9% for the year.
Overall, 88.3 million U.S. households paid for video services as of June
2001 -- up 4.6% from 2000. (Bloomberg News/Los Angeles Times 15 Jan 2001)

THE INTERNET NAME GAME
The London-based Global Name Registry has begun offering registration of
Internet names for individual persons. Name registration will cost about $30
a year (not including Internet access), and the registry plans to expand
".name" designations to mobile phones and other personal devices by the end
of the year.  (AP/San Jose Mercury News 14 Jan 2002)

PHILIPS SAYS COPY-PROTECTED CDs WON'T LAST LONG
Philips Electronics, which invented the compact disc, says the
controversial attempts by the recording industry to market "copy protected"
CDs will fail because consumers just don't like it. As inventor of the CD
standard and the industry's licensing body, Philips says it could refuse to
license the new discs as genuine CDs or pursue some kind of legal action,
but thinks the copy-protected CDs will disappear on their own as consumers
reject them. "Any kind of legal action would take years and we don't expect
these [discs] to last that long," says Gary Wirtz, general manager of the
Philips Copyright Office. "At the moment we are trying to reason with
people rather than sue them. [The technology is] not going to work, because
any hacker can still make copies. It's only going to affect legitimate
consumers and we know there have already been considerable complaints."
Philips opposes the technology because it can make legitimate CDs
unplayable in some older players and in-car audio systems. Critics maintain
that the technique used to block copying can also impair the quality of a
disc's audio content over time. (New Scientist 11 Jan 2002)

THE SPAM WARS
There has been a 16-fold increase in the number of unsolicited commercial
e-mail messages in the past two years (according to the spam-filtering
company Brightmail), and little progress has been made in fighting it,
although sporadic lawsuits have sometimes yielded (very) small (and often
uncollectable) cash judgments against the spammers. The president of the
anti-spam Junkbusters Corporation has compared such lawsuits to "mopping up
an oil spill with a toothbrush." Yet some anti-spammers feel the effort is
worthwhile, and Bennett Haselton, who recently won four judgments of $500
each in Washington state, plans to publish a how-to guide for the
spam-perplexed, hoping that if ought people "get in the habit of taking
legal action if they get spammed, then it's going to become so expensive
that spammers have to get out of business." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 14
Jan 2002)   http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/news/svfront/031444.htm

CHINA SOON TO BECOME WORLD'S SECOND-BIGGEST PC MARKET
International Data Corporation (IDC) is forecasting sales of 13.2 million
PCs in China in 2003, compared with a prediction of 12.7 million units sold
in Japan. If the forecast holds true China will then be Asia's biggest
market for personal computers, and will be the world's second-largest PC
market after the United States. (Reuters/New York Times 8 Jan 2002)

DVDS OUTSELL VIDEOCASSETTES
Sales of DVDs have outpaced sales of videocassettes in the U.S. for the
first time, generating more than $4.6 billion, compared with the $3.8
billion in VHS sales posted for 2001, according to the DVD Entertainment
Group. In addition, DVD rentals generated more than $1.4 billion last year.
"This growth comes from the phenomenal increase in both sales and rentals
of DVDs and has propelled the overall home video business to an
unprecedented annual growth rate of 21% for the year," says Warner Home
Video president Warren Lieberfarb. Sales of DVDs helped drive overall
revenue for the home video industry up from $13.9 billion in 2000 to $16.8
billion in 2001. (Hollywood Reporter 9 Jan 2002)

MICROSOFT INVESTIGATING ALLEGED FLAW IN BROWSER
A serious flaw in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser could
allow hackers to steal sensitive information from computer users
who are lured to Web sites with Trojan horse code. Microsoft
security said it is investigating the claim, first posted on the
BugTraq mailing list. Microsoft also criticized the security
researcher who reported the flaw, saying they were not given
enough lead time to create a solution. BugTraq moderator David
Ahmad said the hole is a failure on Microsoft's part to adhere
to standard security rules that prevent Web sites from stealing
information left by cookies from previously visited Web sites.
The researcher who discovered the flaw said the easiest way to
protect any computer was to disable JavaScript and read e-mail
in text-only format.  (Computerworld Online, 8 January 2002)

CONGRESSMAN MOVES TO PROTECT THE RIGHT TO COPY DIGITAL FILES
Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), a member of the Judiciary Subcommittee
on the Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, said he
will propose an amendment to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA) that will protect the right of consumers to copy digital
files. The act classifies tools used to copy digital material,
such as songs on a CD and DVD movies, as illegal, but Boucher
thinks they should be kept legal, while people who make
unauthorized copies should be subject to sanctions. The
congressman also issued a letter to the Recording Industry
Association of America implying that copy-protected CDs may
constitute a violation of the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act.
In the letter, he expressed his concern that technologies such
as encryption are being used to block home recording, even
though consumers already compensate the entertainment industry
for any potential copying loss whenever they purchase a blank
recordable CD.  (Los Angeles Times, 8 January 2002)

UTAH STUDENT DEFENDS HANDLING OF AIM SECURITY FLAW
The Utah State University student who revealed a dangerous
security hole in AOL's Instant Messenger (AIM) said that he did
so because he received no response from the proper authorities
at that company when he told them about it. Matt Conover said he
and his w00w00 volunteer group of security experts uncovered the
flaw that could allow hackers to take control of a user's computer
using a "buffer overflow" glitch found in an advanced game-playing
features of some AIM versions. AOL criticized the group for making
public such a dangerous vulnerability, but security expert Russ
Cooper of TruSecure agreed with Conover's characterization of AOL
as unresponsive. Nicholas Weaver, a University of California at
Berkeley computer science graduate student, agreed and added that
software companies often disregard potential flaws unless they
are demonstrated in "proof of concept" releases such as the one
Conover posted. (Reuters, 3 January 2002)
