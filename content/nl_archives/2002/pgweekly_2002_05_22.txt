The Marxist Internet Archive (http://www.marxists.org) is in need of
assistance with proofreading. The MIA has many thousands of files
covering 290 authors and 20 languages. The work is all done by
volunteers, and in many cases the standard of proofreading leaves
something to be desired.

The core content of the MIA are the classics of Marxism: Marx, Engels,
Lenin, Trotsky and other members of the Bolshevik Party. The MIA also
holds the most comprehensive English language archive of Hegel, and
significant unique archives of many nineteenth century marxists and
translations of 20th century Russian marxists and an extensive range
of reference material of various kinds.  When copyright permits,
items from the Marxist Internet Archive are contributed to the
Project Gutenberg collection.  Email ablunden@marxists.org.

***] RESERVED LIST UPDATE - CORRECTION [***

Last week, we prematurely removed one Shakespeare etext from the
reserved listing; this week, we've correct that error, and the
corrected announcement should be as follows:

Recently, a major cleanup and reconciliation of the etext directories has
resulted in several Shakespeare etexts being "found", which had previously
been listed as "Reserved", and not counted in the overall etext total.
Here is the list of those seven Shakespeare etexts:

Jun 1999 Macbeth, by William Shakespeare                   [1ws3411x.xxx]1795
Jun 1999 Othello, by William Shakespeare                   [1ws3211x.xxx]1793

     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 05/22/02**:  5,236
(This number includes the 71 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 17 weeks of the new year, we have produced 931 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our *FIRST* 931 eBooks!!!

Jun 1997 Fall of the House of Usher by Edgar Allen Poe [#1][usherxxx.xxx] 932
Jun 1997 The Bab Ballads, by W. S. Gilbert [Gilbert #3]    [2babbxxx.xxx] 931

Jun 1997 The Cyberpunk Fakebook, by St. Jude & R.U. Sirius [fakebxxx.xxx] 929C

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,236 eTexts online as of May 22, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.91 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.86 when we had 3493 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.95 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

WEB ROYALTY RATES REJECTED
Librarian of Congress James Billington has rejected the royalty rates
proposed for online radio, which had been strongly criticized by
webcasters. The suggested rates would have required Web-only radio stations
to pay 0.14 cent per song per listener, an amount that many webcasters said
would drive them out of business. Billington gave no explanation for his
decision, other than he was acting at the recommendation of Marybeth
Peters, the registrar of copyrights. The Recording Industry Association of
America, which had supported the rates, said that Billington's decision
doesn't imply anything about the final outcome of the debate over rates.

[More Lo-Tek Responses To Hi-Tech DRM]
HI-TECH CDs YIELD TO LOW-TECH FELT-TIP MARKER TRICK
Sony's elaborate "Key2Audio" CD copy-protection technology has succumbed to
a decidedly low-tech felt-tip marker used to scribble around the rim of a
disc. Internet postings say that tape or even a sticky note can be used to
cover the security track, typically located on the disc's outer edge. The
technology prevents users from playing the CDs on a computer by adding a
track that contains bogus data. Because computer drives are programmed to
read data files first, the PC tries to play the bogus data file over and
over again and never gets to the music files elsewhere on the disc. The
result is a CD that will play on standard CD players, but not on CD-ROM
drives, some portable devices and even some car stereo systems. Sony has
shipped more than 11 million copy-protected CDs in Europe, with the largest
number going to Germany -- a market executives say is a hotbed of illegal
CD-burning. (Reuters 20 May 2002)

MICROSOFT MAKES IT EASIER TO SWITCH FROM AOL
Microsoft is launching a $10-million ad campaign to promote its new
"switching" service that takes the pain out of changing e-mail accounts for
former AOL users. In addition, Microsoft is offering a $50 rebate to
customers who sign up for MSN under the new plan and pay for the service
for at least three months. The new switch service helps AOL subscribers
automatically move their information to MSN, including address books and
online calendar data, as well as e-mail. The service then takes care of
canceling all AOL accounts and can send a message to everyone in the user's
address book to alert them to the change in e-mail addresses. The service
works only with former AOL customers and not with data stored with other
ISPs, such as EarthLink. (Wall Street Journal 20 May 2002)

SUMERIAN DICTIONARY PROJECT
The five-thousand-year-old cuneiform writing system used starting around
3200 B.C. by Babylon, Chaldea, and other civilizations of Mesopotamia, is
going online in dictionary, photographic and 3D forms, and a team led by
Sumerian-language expert Steve Tinney of the University of Pennsylvania
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology is translating cuneiform into
English online (http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~melindag/psdmain.html). The work
is being partly supported by grants from the National Endowment for the
Humanities. (USA Today 21 May 2002)

ONLINE PRIVACY BILL DELAYED
Parliamentary maneuvering has delayed consideration of a Senate bill that
would protect individual privacy on the Internet and regulate how
businesses may use customer e-mail addresses and other personal data. The
proposed legislation would also limit how businesses may use phone numbers,
purchase records, and other data collected through their Web sites, and
would require online businesses to get customer permission before
collecting or sharing sensitive personal information. "What we are
proposing simply codifies businesses' best practices on the Internet,"
Hollings says Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC), who sponsored the bill.

HP FACES ANTITRUST SCRUTINY BY EU REGULATORS
Hewlett-Packard, newly emerged from its bruising battle over its
acquisition of Compaq Computer, was dealt another blow yesterday when
European Commission authorities indicated they were launching an
investigation into possible anticompetitive behavior in the European ink
cartridge market. Other cartridge makers likely to undergo scrutiny are
Lexmark of the U.S. and Canon and Epson of Japan. The EC said its action
was taken in response to a growing number of complaints from consumers over
the high price of ink cartridges At issue is whether manufacturers use
illegal tactics to force consumers to buy own-brand cartridges instead of
cheaper versions made by rivals. Mario Monti, European competition
commissioner, said on Wednesday: "This is probably a case here for us ...
We intend to examine this in detail." HP strongly denied the allegations:
"HP does not prevent customers from using cartridges from other suppliers,"
it said. (Financial Times 17 May 2002)

CREDIT REPORTS STOLEN FROM EXPERIAN DATABASE
Network vandals have stolen 13,000 credit reports in recent months from
Experian, a national reporting agency. An Experian executive said, "I've
never seen anything of this size. Privacy is the hallmark of our business.
We're extraordinarily concerned about the privacy issue here, and the trust
factor." The intruders used an authorization code from Ford Credit to
obtain the reports, which gave the intruders access to each victim's
personal and financial information, including address, Social Security
number, bank and credit card accounts and ratings of creditworthiness. Ford
has sent letters via certified mail to all 13,000 people, urging them to
contact Experian and the two other major credit reporting companies,
Equifax and TransUnion, and to report any evidence of abuse to the FBI.

MICROSOFT ADMITS AND FIXES DEFECTS IN INTERNET EXPLORER
Microsoft is warning that its Internet Explorer software contains defects
that could give network intruders access to personal information about
computer users. Users of Explorer versions 5.01, 5.5 and 6.0 may download a
patch for the software from the Microsoft site at
www.microsoft.com/security. The flaws could allow vandals to view files on
a user's computer hard drive, permit access by a rogue site, or allow
intruders to change a user's information. But those invasions could occur
only if the hackers knew such specific and detailed information as the
names and locations of the user's files. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 16 May 2002)

'GUMMY' FINGERS FOOL FINGERPRINT SECURITY SYSTEMS
A Japanese engineering professor has managed to trick biometric security
systems using artificial fingers made with gelatin. In addition to creating
a fingerprint by pushing a finger into a malleable plastic mixed with
gelatin, the researchers were able to create credible fingers using
fingerprints lifted from a glass. First, the latent print was hardened,
using glue that sticks to the ridges of the fingerprint. The hardened print
was then photographed, using a digital camera, and enhanced using Adobe
Photoshop software to create heightened contrast between the ridges and
gaps. The image was then transferred to a photosensitive sheet, etched into
copper and used to create another mold. Both methods resulted in a fake
finger that was able to fool a variety of biometric readers 80% of the
time. Security experts say the experiments cast serious doubt on any claims
that this type of biometric system can be made fully secure. (BBC News 17

CHINA SUSPENDS CENSORSHIP OF WESTERN NEWS SITES
Without explanation, the Chinese government has removed blocks on the
normally censored foreign Web sites, including those of such news
organizations as Reuters, CNN and the Washington Post. It is not known
whether the decision would stay in force, and officials at the
International Press Centre and the Ministry of State Security provided no
information about the new development. The Web sites of the Los Angeles
Times, National Public Radio, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Boston
Globe, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution can also now be accessed,
whereas the Time magazine, Voice of America, and BBC News sites still
appear to be blocked. (Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 15 May 2002)

SONICBLUE WINS TEMPORARY REPRIEVE ON TV TRACKING ORDER
SONICblue, maker of the ReplayTV digital video recorder, has won a stay of
a court order that would have forced it to track the television viewing
habits of its customers. Movie studios, including Paramount and Walt
Disney, have sued the company, saying that the recording features included
in the ReplayTV devices, including the ability to skip commercials and
exchange recorded programs with other users, enable users to violate
studios' copyrights. Consumer advocates have objected to the court order,
calling it an invasion of privacy. (Reuters 15 May 2002)

PRIVACY BILL CLEARS COMMITTEE
Despite strong opposition from Senate Republicans and many U.S.
corporations, the Senate Commerce Committee approved an online privacy
bill presented by Sen. Fritz Hollings (D.-S.C.). The bill would require
online companies to obtain specific permission to release consumers'
personal information such as medical records or financial data.
Companies in violation of the law would face fines and the possiblity
of lawsuits from consumers whose information was improperly released.
Republicans in the Senate have hinted that it will be difficult to get
the bill to the Senate floor. Senate Democrats said U.S. companies
should offer American citizens the same privacy protections they offer
the European Union (EU), which has arranged a Safe Harbor agreement
with 180 U.S. companies to protect the privacy of EU citizens.

CONGRESSMAN HOPES TO RECLAIM FAIR USE
Rick Boucher (D.-Va.) plans to introduce legislation that would
override the section of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
that makes it a crime to circumvent any anti-copying technology.
Critics of the DMCA have complained since it was passed in 1998 that
the law goes too far in restricting users' rights to content they
legally own, giving that control to copyright owners. Under the current
law, if someone defeated copy protections to make an otherwise legal
copy of a CD for his own use, the act of circumventing the protection
mechanism is a crime. Under Boucher's proposal, defeating copyright
protections would only be a crime if it was done with the intent to
make illegal copies of the content or otherwise infringe on the
copyright. IDG, 17 May 2002  http://www.idg.net/ic_863105_1794_9-10000.html

ACLU SAYS FACIAL RECOGNITION IS UNRELIABLE
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which opposes the use of
facial-recognition technology for security purposes, said this week
that tests at Palm Beach International Airport show the tools to be
unreliable. The ACLU said early reports indicate an effectiveness of
about 47 percent in identifying volunteer subjects, and this number
goes lower when people wear glasses or turn their heads away from
cameras. The system tested is from Visionics Corp. In another test of
facial-recognition technology at Boston's Logan Airport, officials
from Visionics and Viisage Technology said their systems were effective
more than 90 percent of the time, as reported by CNET
(http://news.com.com/2100-1017-915832.html). An official from Visionics
said a test at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport showed success rates of
between 85 and 93 percent.   Newsbytes, 16 May 2002

FINGERPRINT READERS EASILY FOOLED
In a study presented this week at a conference in Korea, researchers
showed that fake fingers made of gelatin can deceive fingerprint
readers most of the time. Two methods were demonstrated. In the first
method, an artificial fingerprint was made with the consent of the
subject. For the second method, a latent fingerprint, one left on a
glass, for example, can be used to create a gelatin finger that is
often mistaken by readers for an actual finger. Both methods
successfully bypassed fingerprint security devices about 80 percent of
the time. An official from Digital Persona, maker of
fingerprint-recognition technology, said the results are not indicative
of how effective fingerprint readers can be in security screenings.
Other factors, he said, can be used in conjunction with the print
itself to increase accuracy, including body heat and pulse.

COPY PROTECTION CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR MACS
New copy protections included in some audio CDs are causing problems
for Mac users. Some copy-protected CDs, especially those from Sony,
cause Macintosh computers to freeze and not to eject the CD. Although
some CDs have warnings indicating the disc won't play on a PC or Mac,
many do not, and Apple's exclusion of problems caused by these CDs
from its warranty coverage has upset many users. Julian Midgley of the
Campaign for Digital Rights (CDR), however, defended Apple, as did Ted
Landau, operator of the Web site MacFixIt. Both blamed the recording
industry of making products that are not always clearly labeled, saying
that Apple should not be responsible for the difficulties that result.

NEW HOTMAIL ACCOUNT INFORMATION CAUSES CONFUSION AND CONCERN
A new feature of the Hotmail e-mail program allows users to see all of
their options for sharing of personal data. The feature was added,
according to Microsoft representatives, to give users full access to
their account settings. However, many Hotmail users have been surprised
to learn that their accounts were set to opt them in to certain kinds
of promotions and data sharing. Although Microsoft asserts that it has
not changed anyone's settings and has not modified its privacy policy,
some users insist otherwise. Analyst David Ferris said users whose
options were set to share data had probably agreed to that and were
confused by the terms of agreement for their accounts. He applauded
Microsoft for giving users access to the information and the option to
change it. PCWorld, 17 May 2002 http://www.idg.net/ic_863486_1794_9-10000.html
