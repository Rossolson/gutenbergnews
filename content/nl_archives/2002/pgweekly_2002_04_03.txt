sound effects, which you can create using the same software we use, but,
the music in the overtures / epilogues of the chapters is copyrighted /

encouraged. Music is 100 % non-essential, just nice to enhance the
experience of listening to some of the books.

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 03/27/02**:  4,863
(This number includes the 56 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 11 weeks of the new year, we have produced 571 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1996 to produce our *FIRST* 571 eBooks!!!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,816 eTexts online as of March 20, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.06 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.01 when we had 3326 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.95 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 32% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

NEW SEARCH ENGINE HOPES TO OUTGOOGLE GOOGLE
A new search engine called Teoma is angling to unseat Google from its lofty
position as the widely acknowledged leader in finding things on the Web.
"We are the next generation in search," says developer Apostolos
Gerasoulis, who has had Google in his sights since he founded Teoma in
1999. "Google has reached its maturity." Teoma, which is a Gaelic term for
"expert," was bought up by Ask Jeeves for $4.4 million last year and is
relying on Jeeves' deep pockets to finance its challenge. While both Google
and Teoma depend on complicated algorithms to analyze search requests,
Teoma says its formula is more effective because it breaks the Web into
clusters of online communities that serve to categorize results better and
offer more helpful choices. Teoma also offers links to subcategories that
might not have been included in the original request as well as a section
devoted to "expert" sources. Ask Jeeves, which installed Teoma on its site
in December, reports a 25% increase in clicks on search results and a 15%
decline in users leaving the site in frustration. It's hoping to license
Teoma's search engine to other sites this summer. (AP 31 Mar 2002)

INTERNET USE TRENDS IN 2001
A new report by the Nielsen/NetRatings firm says that the overall expansion
of the Internet slowed down in 2001 from the double-digit growth rates seen
in the 1990s to a more modest 6% growth in the number of "active users"
(people who go online at least once a month). However, those who do log on
are likely to stay on longer: users spent 17 hours a month online in
December 2001, up from 15 the previous year. The most active users of all
tended to be those with DSL, cable modem or other high-speed connections.
There were 21 million people with such connections at the end of 2001,
compared to only 11.7 million at the end of 2000. (USA Today 28 Mar 2002)

WHO THOUGHT UP THE AOL TIME WARNER MERGER?
Once hyped as the greatest idea since the invention of sliced bread, the
merger two years ago of "new economy" company online company AOL and "old
economy" publishing empire Time Warner now seems as stale as yesterday's
croissants. In January 2000 the two companies together were worth more than
$300 billion, but now they are down to one-third that amount ($105 billion,
and a further descent is expected). What was the idea? To get marketing
"synergy" that would make the new company more valuable than the sum of its
two parts. But the synergies failed to materialize, and now the company
sometimes seems to be contemplating its own navel (AOL Time Warner is AOL
Time Warner's biggest advertiser). Industry analyst Rick Berry in Atlanta
thinks that the company's stock is still a "sell," calling the merger "an
absolute mistake," and says: "The only reason it went through is that this
was during the silly times in the market. Otherwise, there was not a chance
in hell." (Washington Post 1 Apr 2002)

KAZAA JUDGMENT OVERTURNED BY DUTCH COURT
A Dutch appeals court has ruled that KaZaA, which makes software that
enables users to download music, videos and other copyrighted material, is
not liable for copyright infringement. The decision overturns a judgment
rendered last November, which found KaZaA guilty of violating copyright
law. The appellate court ruling maintains that it's the users of KaZaA's
Media Desktop software who are the infringers, and adds that Media Desktop
was not exclusively designed to pirate copyrighted works. (Reuters/Los

'SMART CARD' FOR FREQUENT FLIERS
EDS, Maximus, and other high-tech companies are racing to capture the
emerging market for "smart cards" that will allow frequent fliers to speed
through air security checkpoints after they submit to retina or hand scans.
Promoters of the systems believe that "trusted traveler" programs like
these not only add to customer convenience but also enhance security, by
providing (in the words of an EDS executive) "better knowledge of the
people getting on the airplane." Civil libertarians are skeptical, and
Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union worries that the use
of such systems would "encourage security personnel to put their guard
down" and that terrorists would just obtain phony documents. But Rachel
Rowland of Maximus says, "It's far easier for someone to get a fake
driver's license. With these cards, nobody else is going to have the same
digital map of your fingerprint." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 28 Mar 2002)

WEB SITES COLLECTING LESS PERSONAL DATA
Many commercial Web sites are cutting back on the amount of personal data
they regularly collect on visitors, with 84% of the 85 sites polled
reporting that they're gathering less data than they did two years ago.
That said, most of the sites -- 96% -- still collect at least some data
from users, according to a survey conducted for the Progress and Freedom
Foundation. The survey included such popular Web sites as Amazon, Google
and Travelocity. Foundation President Jeffrey Eisenach said that the
responses indicated a trend toward giving consumers more control over how
their private information is used: 93% of the Web sites surveyed gave users
the option of restricting the sale or transfer of their information to
other businesses, up from 77% in 2000, and some 72% of sites promised
consumer data would be secure, up from 48% the year before. (Wall Street

Headlines From Edupage

THE ROCKY ROAD OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION
A bill recently introduced by Sen. Hollings has drawn criticism from
various experts, though copyright owners support efforts to curb the
illegal reproduction of copyrighted works. David J. Farber, a
professor of telecommunications systems at the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and a former chief technologist at the
FCC, said the bill is a "very, very badly conceived idea." Rob
Enderle, an analyst at Giga Information Group Inc. speculated that
the restrictions the bill would impose could flatten the market for
PCs because copying songs is "one of the reasons people buy new
machines." The Recording Industry Association of America defended
copyright protection measures, saying that piracy cost the industry
$3 billion in 2001.   Computerworld, 1 April 2002

MICROSOFT, PATCHES AND PROBLEMS
Despite releasing a patch last week for two security flaws in
Internet Explorer, Microsoft is under pressure from security groups
to address a recently revealed problem in Windows NT and Windows 2000.
The IE patch fixed two holes: one would allow hackers to put damaging
code on a Web surfer's computer through a cookie, while the other
could permit the execution of files that already exist on a computer
when the user visits a Web page. The Windows flaw can allow hackers
to gain otherwise restricted privileges on servers running either of
the operating systems. As with other software flaws recently, this
one was revealed by a security services company that decided
information about the flaw was spreading faster than a patch was
being developed, raising the risk of the flaw being exploited.

NEW SEARCH ENGINE TAKES ON GOOGLE
A Rutger's University mathematics professor is confident that the
new version of his search-engine technology will outshine Google,
which many regard as the best available search engine. Apostolos
Gerasoulis, the man behind Teoma, has been working on his search
engine since 1999 and received the financial support to take on
Google when he sold Teoma to Ask Jeeves for $4.4 million last year.
Since then, new tools have been added to Teoma that Gerasoulis
believes make his product more effective at finding Web resources
than Google. The algorithms that Teoma uses divide the Web into
clusters of online communities. Rob Lancaster of the Yankee Group
said that one of the benefits of Google is its simplicity and that
Teoma will have to educate users about how to get the most from
its site.      Associated Press, 1 April 2002

SURVEY SHOWS MOST WEB SITES COLLECTING LESS INFORMATION
A new survey indicates that most Web sites, including some of
most commonly used sites, are collecting less personal data from
users than they were two years ago. The survey was conducted by
the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a Washington, D.C., group
opposed to new privacy legislation. Timothy Muris, chairman of
the Federal Trade Commission, applauded the change, pointing to
market forces as at least partly responsible. The study also
indicated that more sites reveal exactly how personal data
collected will be used.
(Associated Press, 27 March 2002)

YAHOO! REVISES PRIVACY POLICY
Internet portal Yahoo! has announced a new privacy policy that
makes it easier for the company to release personal information
to third parties. Yahoo! stated that the new policy replaces
three previous policies in an effort both to be as clear as
possible and to comply with legislation including the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. According to the new policy, users'
personal data can be released to investigators looking into
allegations of illegal activity including fraud and threats.
The policy also states that if Yahoo! is acquired by another
firm, that firm's policy regarding personal data would apply
to Yahoo! data. Evan Hendricks, editor of the newsletter
"Privacy Times," said that especially in the aftermath of
September 11, the pendulum of privacy has swung "toward making
it easier to disclose information."
(CNet, 28 March 2002)

FBI MUST TURN OVER CARNIVORE INFO
A federal judge has ordered the FBI to dig deeper in trying to
locate information collected by its Carnivore e-mail surveillance
tool. The FBI contends that all data collected using Carnivore
was gathered under the authority of court orders. The FBI had
turned data over as part of a legal battle with the Electronic
Privacy Information Center (EPIC), but the judge agreed with
EPIC that the FBI may not have produced all of the documents
related to Carnivore searches. EPIC took the FBI to court in
July of 2000 to try to gain access to the data under the Freedom
of Information Act. The outcome of the case will likely affect
how the federal government uses electronic surveillance in its
investigations.   (ZDNet, 27 March 2002)
