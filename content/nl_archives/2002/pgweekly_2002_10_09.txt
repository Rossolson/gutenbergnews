PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING PRODUCTION COORDINATORS

Do you like working with different file formats and character sets,
have skills with text editors, know a little Unix?  Can you handle
receiving large file attachments by email?  Do you have a passion for
making Project Gutenberg's eBooks look as good as possible, from
receiving a file from a volunteer through uploading and announcing it
to the world?

If so, please email gbnewby@ils.unc.edu or hart@pobox.com.  We are
currently seeking one or more new Production Coordinators, who work
for at least 5-10 hours per week to format, edit and upload Project
Gutenberg's eBooks.  This is tough work, but highly rewarding and varied.

***

We also have a Balzac short story from Droll Stories. . .in French,
that needs proofing.

***

David R. <mr_der@hotmail.com> is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

We need some help with Balzac in French:

Title: Les Contes Drtlatiques
Subtitle: Les joyeulsetez du Roy Loys le unziesme
[Sorry, French gets mangles by my emailer]
Author: Honore de Balzac
Language: French
Character set encoding: ISO8859-1

***

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

***

We Have Included Quick and Easy Ways to Donate. . .As Per Your Requests!

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

(This number includes the 109 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

Statistical Review

In the first 40 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,816 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our *FIRST* 1,816 eBooks!!!

             That's 40 WEEKS as Compared to 28 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 6,108 eTexts online as of October 2, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.64 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.52 when we had 3896 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.88 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 6108 eBooks in 31 Years We Averaged
    197 Per Year   [This is how many we do per month these days!]
     16 Per Month
     .5 Per Day

At 1808 eBooks Done In 2002 We Averaged
      6.4 eBooks Per Day
     45 eBooks Per Week
    202 eBooks Per Month

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

[Warning, this model has no light and no cradle.  Uses USB cable & charger.
Takes 3 hours to charge with charger, 9 hours with mini-USB cable.
It took me dozens of search hits to find one that mentioned the RAM and CPU
. . .probably because these are not very hot selling points. . .2M RAM with
no way to add more. . .16Mhz CPU. . .unlike most current PDAs, which have
16M RAM and 66Mhz CPUs.  Also missing are two of the normal four buttons,
so you'll have problems with software that presumes you have four buttons.
You can still get the discontinued Visor Edge for $149, with 8M RAM, light,
cradle, four buttons, charges much more quickly. . .I seem to recall that
it rarely takes over half an hour, unless the batteries are totally drained.]


PALM WILL OFFER A HANDHELD FOR $99
Staking out a position in the low end of the handheld computer market, Palm
is offering an entry-level device for $99. Called the Palm Zire, it's made
in China for less than $80. Industry analyst Tim Bajarin of the Creative
Strategies consulting firm says Palm's low-end strategy has a pretty good
chance of succeeding: "Palm should have this part of the market to
themselves for actually quite a while. It's pretty much a win-win for Palm,
for Palm software partners, for Palm after-market partners." Sony and
Handspring, the No. 2 and No. 3 handheld manufacturers, also use the Palm
operating system, are focused on the higher end of the market, and the
companies that license Microsoft Pocket PC software usually charge $300 or
more for their products. (San Jose Mercury News 6 Oct 2002)

Headlines From Edupage:

INITIAL MIT COURSEWORK GOES ONLINE
This week MIT began placing courseware online as part of its
OpenCourseWare project (http://ocw.mit.edu/). MIT opted not to develop
a for-profit learning initiative, as some other colleges and
universities have, choosing instead to make its courseware open to the
public online. MIT plans to put lecture notes, assignments, syllabi,
tutorials, video simulations, and reading lists from over 2,000 courses
on the site over the next ten years, though no credit will be offered
for those who complete the assignments. Questions remain about
technology tools for the site and intellectual property issues, but a
representative of the program said that so far the response has been
overwhelmingly positive. Critics said the offerings so far are limited
and that merely posting such resources online does not substitute for
an education at MIT. Officials from OpenCourseWare agreed that the
experience of learning at MIT is not replicated by the program, but
they hope that it will serve as a model for other institutions to
disseminate their own resources.
