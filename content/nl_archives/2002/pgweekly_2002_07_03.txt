--Update On Music Site

Gutenberg Music Web Site Launch  [NEW EMAIL ADDRESS] gpawlicki@earthlink.net

Project Gutenberg is proud to inaugurate the Music Website
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music/ as the principle outlet for the Chamber
Music Archive. You'll find free scores and parts of public domain music,
digitized in a variety of printable, playable and editable formats.
The initial postings are classical chamber music, including quartets by
Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn and Brahms in Coda Music's Finale (.MUS) format.
For further information regarding procedures, the files, and the site,
please see entries in the FAQ
<http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music/music_helpex.html>
and Volunteer <http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music/music_volunteer.html> pages,
or contact Geof Pawlicki <MAILTO:geof@ibiblio.net> directly.

--Project Gutenberg in Portugal

We have received word from Joao Marques in Portugal that there will soon
be a Project Gutenberg site in that country, that will be similar to the
Project Gutenberg site in Australia, allowing the people of Portugal to
access Ebooks which are in the public domain in that country.  This is
still in early development, and we will provide more details as soon as
they become available.

And a huge PG welcome to the new associates in Portugal!

***

--Requests for Assistance:

Programmers familiar with the Palm OS are needed to help write a
freeware application which will allow the contents of
GUTINDEX.ALL (all the books loaded into Project Gutenberg) to be
synched to a Palm (or similar) handheld computer.  This would
allow volunteers to check whether a book is already in the system
before picking one up at a library or garage sale.  Additionally,
the system is intended to allow volunteers to track texts they
have acquired and are in the process of preparing for Project
Gutenberg.  Please contact William Fishburne
(william.fishburne@verizon.net) if you are able to help.  Access
to a compiler which can generate code for the Palm OS and/or a
compiler for generating conduits (PC, Mac, Lynix, Beos, whatever)
would be necessary.  Thanks!


We Have Included Quick and Easy Ways to Donate. . .As Per Your Requests!


We Are Looking For Volunteers To Add eBooks In More Languages,
and in more formats, including music, artwork, movies, etc.

DETAILS ON DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or

"Project Gutenberg" as your donation recipient, and send
a portion of online shopping expenses to Project Gutenberg.
If you know of additional affiliate programs, please email
donate@gutenberg.net

Project Gutenberg does not endorse or partner with any particular
affiliate program.  We know that they can be awkward to use and
often ask for extensive personal information.  But we also know
that they are a good fit for some donors.

With 5,508 eTexts online as of July 3rd, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.82 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.82 when we had 3548 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.99 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

SPINTRONICS SHRINKS DATA STORAGE TO NANOSCALE
Researchers at the University at Buffalo in New York have developed a
nickel-based, magnetic sensor, measuring only a few atoms in diameter, that
could increase data storage capacity 1,000 times through the use of
spintronics -- a field that takes advantage of electron spin as well as
charge. Current technology used in data-reading sensors is based on giant
magnetoresistance (GMR), where sensor resistance changes in a magnetic
field. The new sensor developed at UB creates an effect called ballistic
magnetoresistance (BMR), which uses an electrical conductor only a few
atoms in size. Researchers say the technology could ultimately make it
possible to store 50 or more DVDs on a hard drive the size of a credit
card, or enable military personnel to carry supercomputers the size of a
wristwatch into the field. (NewsFactor 1 Jul 2002)

[The Return Of "Time Share" Computing???]

IBM PUTS A METER ON SOFTWARE USE
IBM is introducing a new service called Linux Virtual Services that enables
customers to run a wide variety of software applications on IBM mainframes
located in company data centers, and pay rates based largely on the amount
of computing power they use. This metered payment system marks a major
shift from the more conventional outsourcing and Web hosting arrangements
typical today. IBM executive James Corgel touted the new service, saying
"we see a huge opportunity going forward. Our best estimate is that in five
years, 10% to 15% of the $1 trillion IT market will be in the form of
on-demand computing," with utility computing a significant part. Industry
analysts remain a little more cautious about the prospects for metered
computing. "We know customers are interested in doing this, but we don't
know how many will," says one market researcher. Another added that "the
pricing is still very complicated. It's not like electricity or even phone
service." (Wall Street Journal 1 Jul 2002)

MUSIC INDUSTRY WAGES GUERRILLA WARFARE AGAINST P2P SERVICES
In a practice called "spoofing," the music industry has been swamping
online music-swapping services like Morpheus, Kazaa, and Grokster with
thousands of phony or mangled music files rather than the sought-after
songs. One music executive, speaking anonymously, says: "We're not using
any of this with any kind of promotion or marketing in mind. We're doing
this simply because we believe people are stealing our stuff and we want to
stymie the stealing." And Cary Sherman, president of the Recording Industry
Association of America, says: " From the outset, it's been very clear that
one of the only ways -- as a practical matter -- to deal with the
peer-to-peer problem is by means of technological measures. There are
certainly mechanisms that are available -- that are completely lawful, such
as spoofing.'' (San Jose Mercury-News 27 Jun 2002)

ERGONOMICS FOR THE VERY YOUNG
An elementary school in Washington state is one of the few to offer an
ergonomics program for children that teaches them how to avoid repetitive
stress injuries while working on the computer. The "Get TechFit!" program
touts the benefits of  taking frequent breaks, using correct posture, and
exercising fatigued muscles. Ergonomics experts say that just as women are
injured in the workplace more often than men because they must extend their
wrists and arms unnaturally to type and use the mouse, children are also
undersized for most workstation setups. "If you're a small-wristed child,
you will be in greater extension," says Peter Johnson, a professor at the
University of Washington who's studied workplace injury. Johnson says
computers generally are better designed for men, who have broader shoulders
and thicker wrists. (AP 28 Jun 2002)

ICANN PROPOSES RULES TO FIGHT CYBERSQUATTING
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) says it's
close to adopting new procedures that would make it easier for individuals
and businesses to avoid extortion by cybersquatters, and would establish a
waiting list for coveted domains that become newly available to the public.
The first measure would establish a 30-day grace period for domain name
owners to renew their contracts -- a move intended to prevent speculators
from swooping in and registering an expiring domain name before the owner
has time to renew. "ICANN receives a large number of complaints for
inadvertently deleted domains. It affects churches, schools, businesses,"
says an ICANN spokesman. "We get a lot of complaints from people who wake
up to find their domain has expired and now has porn on it, or it's linked
to a casino site. Then, they'll ask for a ransom to get it back." The
waiting-list proposal would allow a bidder to pay a fee to get first dibs
on any newly available domain names. That proposal has run into opposition
from registrars who say the $28 that VeriSign has proposed charging them
for the service is too high. (Reuters/Wired 27 Jun 2002)

LEGISLATION WOULD SANCTION STUDIO HACK ATTACKS
Proposed legislation crafted by California congressman Howard Berman, whose
district includes Hollywood, would provide a shield against legal liability
for copyright owners, such as record labels and movie studios, that used
high-tech attacks against peer-to-peer Web sites to stop them from enabling
illegal file-sharing. "While P2P technology is free to innovate new and
more efficient methods of distribution that further exacerbate the piracy
problem, copyright owners are not equally free to craft technological
responses," says Berman. "This is not fair." Included in the actions a
copyright holder would be allowed to take are: interdiction, in which the
copyright holder swamps a P2P file server with false requests so that
downloads can't get through; redirection, in which would-be file swappers
are pointed to a site that doesn't contain the files they're seeking; and
spoofing, in which a corrupt or otherwise undesirable file masquerades as
the song or movie file being sought by a file swapper. File-swapping
companies criticized the bill, saying it opens the door for copyright
holders to conduct "cyber warfare" against consumers.

HOME WIRELESS NETWORKS GO MAINSTREAM
The price of wireless networks has dropped so dramatically -- they're now
in the $200 range -- that homeowners are snapping them up as a less messy
alternative to traditional wiring. The number of home network devices
shipped is expected to nearly double this year, as wireless gear based on
newer, faster technologies such as the AirPlus products introduced earlier
this month by D-Link, hit the market. Although some consumers report
hassles in installing the networks, the technology is well suited to the
networking needs of the increasing number of broadband-equipped households
with multiple computers. (Wall Street Journal 26 Jun 2002)

WEB SITES USED BY AMERICANS TO GET CHEAPER DRUGS FROM CANADA
A number of Web sites (including canadianmedsusa.com, canadadrugs.com,
canadameds.com, and pharmacy-online.ca) are now offering a way for U.S.
citizens to buy prescription drugs more cheaply through Canadian sources.
U.S. law actually prohibits the practice, but the Federal Drug
Administration has, for reasons of compassion, refrained from actively
enforcing the law. To order from Canada, customers must have a prescription
signed by an American physician, submit a detailed medical questionnaire,
and have undergone a physical exam within the past year. However, the
Canadian Medical Association is questioning the ethics of Canadian doctors
writing Canadian prescriptions based solely on a written questionnaire and
a U.S. prescription: "Our code of ethics says if you're going to prescribe
medications, you have a professional responsibility to do a history, a
physical and then discuss with the patient the risks and benefits of the
medication. This is something Canadian physicians should not be doing."

NEW TOOLS CAN BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE ARCHIVE
Some institutions, including MIT, are developing tools for professors
and other researchers to add resources including data sets, notes,
research reports, and otherwise unpublished papers to large,
searchable, digital archives. Testing of DSpace, MIT's archive
project, will begin this summer, and officials at the school hope that
eventually nearly every professor will contribute to the body of work.
Submission to the archive is voluntary, so developers have tried to
make the system as simple as possible. Metadata will be included to aid
in the organization and searching of the content, though submissions
will not be actively filtered or moderated. Other archives have been
established at the California Institute of Technology and the
University of California system. Critics say that institutional
repositories will fail because effective dissemination depends on the
publishing process and editorial filtering that journals provide.

MICROSOFT TO INVEST IN SOFTWARE INDUSTRY IN CHINA
On Thursday, at the end of a two-day visit to China, Microsoft chief
executive Steve Ballmer announced that his company would invest roughly
$750 million over the next three years in the Chinese software
industry. The money will support education, manufacturing, and a number
of local Chinese software companies. The move is seen as partly a
response to widespread software piracy in China. According to that
argument, if there is a strong Chinese software industry that has a
stake in protecting its intellectual property, the incidence of
software piracy will significantly diminish. Ballmer's announcement
also included plans to establish a software college in Shanghai.

WEB PUBLISHERS SUE OVER POP-UP ADS
Operators of several Web sites, including Washington Post Company, Dow
Jones & Company, and The New York Times Company, have sued Gator, a
company that makes software that helps users enter passwords and other
information online. The password software, however, includes features
that deliver pop-up advertisements. Those ads, according to the group
of publishers, violate trademark because there is an implication that
the operator of the Web site being viewed has authorized the ad that
pops up. Officials at Gator have called the suit ridiculous, saying
that many other applications that display information in separate
windows, such as instant messaging programs, would have to be
considered illegal if the publishers' argument is valid. A survey of
users conducted by the plaintiffs showed that 16 percent of people who
use Gator's password software do not know that it puts pop-up ads on
their computers.

ICANN VOTES TO LIMIT BOARD MEMBERSHIP
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) voted
on Friday at its meeting in Romania not to allow its Board of Directors
to include members elected from the pool of Internet users at large.
Instead, Board membership will be limited to representatives of
technical, business, government, and nonprofit organizations, according
to the unanimous vote. Critics said the move amounts to a lack of
representation for many of the 425 million global Internet users. ICANN
chief executive Stuart Lynn said the new system will still allow users
to be represented by various constituencies on the Board, including
government and other groups. ICANN has also been criticized for having
a U.S. bias, and Friday's vote did little to mollify those complaints.

NEW CHIP-MAKING PROCESS MAY OUTPACE MOORE'S LAW
Stephen Chou, a researcher at Princeton University, said he has
developed a procedure for making computer chips that could increase
their capacity 100-fold. The process, called laser assisted direct
input (LADI), involves pressing a quartz mold onto a piece of silicon
and shooting it with a laser for a very short time. The silicon melts
and quickly rehardens into the new shape. The result is imprinting
silicon with features as small as 10 nanometers, significantly smaller
than current methods allow. The process is also claimed to produce
chips much more cheaply, more quickly, and without the environmentally
unfriendly chemicals required of traditional chip-making methods. Some
observers noted that the process is in the very early stages of
development and is probably not "inherently useful in the near term."

MUSIC INDUSTRY TRIES SPOOFING FILE SWAPPERS
In the latest effort to try to discourage the illegal trading of files,
some in the music industry have begun a campaign of "spoofing," or
sending decoy files to file-swapping networks. The decoys seem to be
legitimate songs, for example, but might only be a small portion that
loops or may have long stretches of silence. Industry officials hope
that by making it more difficult to find and trade functional copies of
their copyrighted material, some users will be persuaded to buy the CD
they want. Industry experts pointed out that seasoned file traders and
those with higher levels of technical expertise are not likely to be
fooled by the spoofs, but many more novice users potentially will be.
The practice of spoofing is not illegal, but some say it will do little
to stem the tide of piracy.

STUDY PUTS A NUMBER TO LOSSES FROM BUGGY SOFTWARE
A new study from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) says that the U.S. economy loses almost $60 billion annually as
a result of buggy software. According to the study, better testing
could eliminate about one third of that loss, but much of the rest will
remain. The study addressed the problem as it affects three major
industries, automotive, aerospace, and financial services, and
extrapolated those results to the nation as a whole. Authors of the
study did not present specific actions to resolve the problem, but they
did suggest that current methods for testing software are "fairly
primitive" and that significant improvements could be made in that area.

LINDOWS CLAIMS LOW-COST ALTERNATIVE TO WINDOWS
Lindows, maker of a Linux-based operating system that is claimed to
allow users to run Windows applications, has announced a new program
that could potentially save significant amounts of money for software
on new computer systems. The program offers computer makers a
subscription service, including technical support, testing tools,
certification eligibility, and a software library, that allows them to
install the operating system on an unlimited number of machines for the
same monthly fee. The program is targeted at computer makers who sell
unbranded PCs and lower-end systems such as those available from
Wal-Mart. Critics noted that the Lindows operating system does not run
many Windows programs and that the way the system works opens users up
to potentially serious security risks.

AUSTRALIA LEGALIZES MUSIC PIRACY
The Australian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society (AMCOS) has agreed
to allow CD-copying kiosks in exchange for a royalty payment. The deal,
the first of its kind, will allow consumers to go to one of the kiosks,
to be located in stores or in public places, and pay $5 each to copy a
music CD. AMCOS, which represents songwriters and music publishers,
agreed to the deal with Little Ripper, a CD-copying company, reportedly
for a flat royalty of about six percent. Observers said that this deal,
which seems to indicate acceptance among copyright owners that piracy
is here to stay, will force the Australian Record Industry Association
(ARIA) into a similar arrangement. Officially ARIA still says that the
kiosks are illegal.

RUSSIA TO SET LIMITS ON WEB
In a vote last week, the Russian Duma supported new restrictions on
anti-government and extremist uses of the Internet. The measure still
needs final approval, which could come this week. The terms of the
legislation forbid using computer networks for "extremism" and allow
the government to shut down without a court order any organization it
deems "extremist." Civil liberties groups in Russia complained that the
law would restrict rights of citizens and would threaten the
"constitutional order in Russia." Victor Naumov, a lecturer at St.
Petersburg State University's law school, said the language of the
measure is vague in many places, leaving some questions about how
exactly it could be applied.
