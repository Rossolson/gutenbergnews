Requests For Assistance:


Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

***

CIA FACT BOOK READY FOR FORMATTING  [Third Request]

The 2002 edition of the CIA World Fact Book is now
available at http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html
Project Gutenberg needs a volunteer to harvest and reformat
this work into plain text (HTML is optional).  See our previous
WFB's for formatting idea.  Interested?  Email gbnewby@ils.unc.edu

***

Second Request for Alice

If we could get a volunteer to scan them in a similarly large size
to the other Alice illustrations, then I could have a go at producing
an illustrated version of "Through the Looking Glass".
From: Martin Ward <Martin.Ward@durham.ac.uk>
[This would require scanning about 50 illustrations]

***

David R. <mr_der@hotmail.com> is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Third Request!

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the first 10 months of this year, we have produced 1,916 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our *FIRST* 1,916 eBooks!!!

             That's 10 MONTHS as Compared to 29 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,267 eTexts online as of November 6, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.60 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.45 when we had 4006 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.85 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???


At 6269 eBooks in 31 1/3 Years We Averaged
    200 Per Year   [This is about how many we do per month these days!]
     17 Per Month
     .5 Per Day

At 1976 eBooks Done In 2002 We Averaged
      6.4 eBooks Per Day
     45 eBooks Per Week
    201 eBooks Per Month
