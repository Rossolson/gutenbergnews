DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. <mr_der@hotmail.com> is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

Third Request!

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the first 50 weeks of this year, we have produced 2,283 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,583 eBooks online as of December 18, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.52 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.36 when we had 4232 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.77 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

E-GOV ADVANCES
President Bush has signed into law the E-Government Act of 2002, a law
intended to offer more government information and services over the
Internet while honoring the privacy of citizens through standards and
oversight protections. The law requires that each federal court establish a
Web site where its decisions and other actions are publicly accessible, and
directs federal regulatory agencies to publish on the Web everything they
publish in the Federal Register. (PC World 17 Dec 2002)

RUSSIAN FIRM CLEARED IN U.S. COPYRIGHT CASE
ElcomSoft Co. Ltd., based in Moscow, has been found not guilty of criminal
charges that it violated the 1998 U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act by
selling a software program designed to circumvent the digital locks used to
enforce copyright protections on Adobe Systems e-book software. The
two-week trial was the first criminal prosecution under the controversial
DCMA, which prohibits the sale of technology that can be used to break the
code that "locks" digitally formatted movies, music and other software. The
case hinged on whether ElcomSoft had "willfully" violated U.S. law, an
intent the defendants denied. "They never intended to violate the law,"
said defense attorney Joseph Burton. ElcomSoft president Alexander Katalov
pointed out that the program was legal in Russia and was not meant to be
used for electronic books that had not been legally purchased. He said he
didn't know that the software was illegal under U.S. law.(Reuters 17 Dec 2002)

WHOSE PRODUCTIVITY IS IT, ANYWAY?
It's dinner time, but put that fork down and go answer the phone and listen
to ... 15 seconds of silence, followed by a sales pitch. What you're being
treated to is a lesson in productivity. The telemarketing firm that's
calling you has used a "predictive dialer" to rapidly dial a number of
lines at one time, monitored by computer software that predicts when
they've got a live one on the line (the live one would be you). Okay, hang
up the phone and pick up your fork again, happy to have done your part for
greater efficiency. Jerry Cerasale of the Direct Marketing Association says
nationwide do-not-call list. Maybe that will help.(New York Times 18 Dec 2002)

WEB ACTIVISTS GO AFTER RALSKY AND POINDEXTER
Web activists have uncovered the home address and phone numbers for
government surveillance head John Poindexter and bulk spammer Alan Ralsky,
and have posted the information on more than 100 Web sites. The action has
led to Ralsky being deluged with junk mail and Poindexter undergoing the
scrutiny that every American soon will experience. An article in the
Detroit Free Press quoted Ralsky as complaining, "They're harassing me,"
after anti-spammers signed him up with as many direct mail agencies as
possible. In Poindexter's case, his home address, complete with satellite
photos, has been published online as well as his phone number and those of
his neighbors. That's actually just a small portion of the personal
information the U.S. government plans to collect under Poindexter's Total
Information Awareness program, which will compile credit card, medical,
travel, school and other records in an effort to spot terrorists.

MICROSOFT WARNS OF 'CRITICAL' SECURITY FLAWS IN WINDOWS
Microsoft revealed "critical" flaws in its Windows operating system that
conceivably could allow hackers to alter data stored in computers, load and
run malicious programs, or reformat hard drives. Microsoft is urging
Windows users to download a new version of Microsoft Virtual Machine, which
is the part of Windows that runs Java applications. "An attacker could, in
the most serious of these vulnerabilities, gain complete control of a
user's system and take any action" he or she chooses, said John Montgomery,
head of Microsoft's developer platform and evangelism group. Security
features in Outlook Express 6 and Outlook 2002 are safe from the
HTML-mail-based attacks by default and Outlook 98 and 2000 users are also
protected if users have installed the Microsoft security updates for them.
The good news is, a hacker would have to be quite sophisticated to carry
out an attack of the kind described, says Gary Bahadur, CIO at Foundstone.
"This is not an easy attack at all. You've got to be pretty slick, pretty
creative." (Wall Street Journal 13 Dec 2002)

GROUP OFFERS COPYRIGHT LICENSES FOR ACCEPTABLE USES
The Creative Commons is a group set up last year to increase the amount
of intellectual property that is available for public use and to make
uses of such property easy and inexpensive. To that end, the group this
week will release its first set of copyright licenses that copyright
owners can use to specify how and when their content may be used. The
licenses allow broader use of material than copyright law, giving
copyright holders a simple way to identify acceptable uses without
relinquishing their copyright. Copyright owners can choose one of four
predefined copyright tools, they can craft their own acceptable uses
and restrictions, or they can release their work into the public domain
with no restrictions.

CALIFORNIA LAWS REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF SECURITY LAPSES
A new law in California will require companies to notify customers if a
lapse in computer security has allowed unauthorized access of the
users' identities and personal information. In all, the California
legislature approved more than a dozen measures this session dealing
with identity theft. A draft is being circulated of another bill,
written by California Senator Diane Feinstein, that would require
businesses to disclose information about all lapses in security to
police. Many security experts say that early detection and notification
are vital in dealing with identity theft, giving consumers ample time
to address the problem if they know their personal information has been
exposed. California has taken a very proactive stance on disclosure of
security breaches, even when companies are unsure if personal
information was obtained. Some argue that the laws go too far. Mark
Rasch, former head of the Computer Crime Unit at the U.S. Department of
Justice, said the laws are onerous and "a potential public relations
nightmare" for companies that are forced to reveal security lapses.

STANFORD TO MOVE AHEAD WITH STEM CELL RESEARCH
Stanford University medical professor Irving Weissman said that the
school intends to experiment with cell nuclear transfer technology.
Weissman said that the goal is to advance science and denied that the
project involves cloning embryos. The researchers plan to take DNA from
diseased adult human cells, transfer the DNA into eggs, then grow the
eggs for a few days to produce stem cells. Other researchers dismiss
this distinction, claiming that this type of nuclear transfer creates
an exact genetic replica of the adult cell donor. The stem cell work
will take place under the auspices of the new Institute for Cancer/Stem
Cell Biology and Medicine, of which Weissman is the director. The
university has said it plans to share resulting stem cell lines with
other researchers.
