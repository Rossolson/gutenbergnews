(Note: This is an important ruling for Project Gutenberg, in that is
  removes the necessity for US libraries to run filtering software
  as had been ordered by the CIPA legislation.  PG doesn't usually
  distribute legislation and rulings, but in this case it seemed
  worthwhile.  At 195 pages, the ruling is an extensive and informed
  look at Internet use and censorship.)

     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 06/05/02**:  5,310
(This number includes the 71 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 22 weeks of the new year, we have produced over 1,000 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our *FIRST* 1,000 eBooks!!!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year for 2001, so the 9th was the end of the first production week.

With 5,309 eTexts online as of June 5, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.88 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.83 when we had 3531 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.95 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???
