DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. <mr_der@hotmail.com> is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Third Request!

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the first 48 weeks of this year, we have produced 2,187 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,479 eBooks online as of December 4, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.54 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.40 when we had 4161 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.81 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

LIBRARY FILTERS BAN THE LIBRARY
An Ohio library found itself blocked on its own system after
it installed net filtering software.  The Flesh Public Library
had its own site blocked after the program blocked sites with
the word "flesh".  Rather than considering the implications
of the software, the library simply changed its name.

Headlines From Newsscan

DIGITAL DOMESDAY BOOK GETS NEW LIFE
The BBC's computer-based, multimedia version of the famed Domesday Book has
received a new lease on life, thanks to scientists at Leeds University and
the University of Michigan, who have found a way to access the archive
stored on 1980s-era interactive video discs. To unlock the now-obsolete
technology, the Camileon project teams have developed software that
emulates the Acorn Microcomputer system and the video disc player. "BBC
Domesday has become a classic example of the dangers facing our digital
heritage," says project manager Paul Wheatley. "But it must be remembered
that time is of the essence. We must invest wisely in developing an
infrastructure to preserve our digital records before it is too late. We
must not make the mistake of thinking that recording on a long-lived medium
gives us meaningful preservation." The information on the Domesday discs
has been inaccessible for 16 years. By contrast, the original Domesday
Book, an inventory of England compiled in 1086 by Norman monks, is in fine
condition in a London Public Record Office. (BBC News 2 Dec 2002)

TRANSISTORS MADE FROM PLASTIC
A Xerox research team has developed an experimental polymer usable for
making organic transistors on a plastic substrate. "Think about the value of
a laptop or cell phone display that you could drop without breaking," says
one team member. The making of printed plastic transistors in phones and
PDAs will be done on a new electronics manufacturing process on roll-to-roll
machinery of the kind now used in publishing. (New York Times 3 Dec 2002)

WHAT DOES STEVE CASE DO ALL DAY?
Steve Case's "advisory-only" position at AOL Time Warner continues to be
scrutinized, and industry analysts continue to suggest that the embattled
chairman (and former head of AOL before its merger with Time Warner) is a
superfluous figure. Paul Kim of Kaufman Brothers says, "There is increased
scrutiny of what Steve Case's role is, and there are more questions about
what his function is in the corporation." And John Tinker of Blaylock &
AOL." But many observers insist that Case is resilient and should not be
never as good or as bad as the press, or the street, says you are... In my

ADVERTISING DROP WILL DELAY AOL'S FINANCIAL REBOUND
America Online's attempt to attain financial health will be delayed until
2004 as the result of an expected 40-50% drop in advertising revenues next
year, and the company is predicting an overall 15-25% fall in profitability
during that period. AOL Time Warner chairman Steve Case (the former AOL
chairman who has been much-criticized for his role in engineering the merger
direction builds on AOL's past. This marks not just an important new
beginning for AOL but a new beginning for AOL Time Warner. It is a new day."

A study by Harvard Law School researchers finds that China is the country
with the world's most oppressive censorship of what its citizens can view on
the Internet. Chinese authorities block access to 19,000 sites, and also
delete individual links or Web pages of which they do not approve. Most of
the disapproved sites are political in nature. When it comes to blocking
pornography, China (at least for now) cedes the first-place prize to Saudi
to Saudi Arabia's blocking of 86%. (New York Times 4 Dec 2002)

FEE-BASED MUSIC SERVICES LANGUISH
While free music file-swapping services such as Kazaa continue to flourish
(with Kazaa now attracting almost 14 million U.S. visitors a month),
fee-based services such as MusicNet have not succeed in finding a solid
customer base of more than 100,000 subscribers. Are people just not willing
to pay for music online? Or is the problem something else? Some industry
watchers think the more important problem for fee-based music services is
that they don't offer enough music selections. (For example, MusicNet was
recently offering only two of the top 10 of the most popular songs in the
country.) But industry executives are confident in their belief that it's
just a matter of time before they can prove that music consumers, just like
consumers of bottled water, will pay for something they can get for free
provided the marketing and distribution are right. (San Jose Mercury News 2

Headlines From Edupage

WEB SITE LETS STUDENTS POINT OUT BIAS
The Web site NoIndoctrination.org lets students anonymously accuse
professors, by name, of political bias. Luann Wright, a designer of
science curriculums, started the course two years after her son took a
writing course at the University of California at San Diego that she
found objectionable. Students using the new site can rate the perceived
level of bias in a professor's lectures, reading list, and class
discussions, and post anonymous accusations, reportedly to avoid
retaliation from professors named. Professors can write rebuttals,
although few have taken advantage of the opportunity.

PANELISTS DISCUSS SOFTWARE AS CENSOR
A conference at Columbia University on free expression and the arts
focused on new limits on artistic freedom in a technology-heavy
culture. Artists in this environment face copyright issues, whether in
trying to obtain  materials or in having their own rights (including
free speech) infringed, and the possibility of censorship of their work
by software filters. The National Arts Journalism Program sponsored the
conference. Participants debated the pros and cons of such things as
the extension of copyright law another 20 years and attempts by the
entertainment industry to restrict file sharing.
