     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 05/29/02**:  5,269
(This number includes the 71 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 21 weeks of the new year, we have produced 964 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our *FIRST* 964 eBooks!!!

            That's 21 WEEKS Compared to 26 YEARS!!!


Jul 1997 The Black Tulip, by Alexandre Dumas[Pere][Dumas#1][tbtlpxxx.xxx] 965
Jul 1997 The Adventures of Robin Hood, by Howard Pyle[HP#1][2rbnhxxx.xxx] 964
Jul 1997 Little Dorrit, by Charles Dickens  [Dickens #30]  [ldortxxx.xxx] 963
Jul 1997 The Poems of Henry Kendall, by Henry Kendall      [phkndxxx.xxx] 962
Jul 1997 Glinda of Oz, by L. Frank Baum  [LFB#17] [Oz#14]  [14wozxxx.xxx] 961

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,269 eTexts online as of May 29, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.90 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.85 when we had 3493 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.95 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS PRIVACY CONCERNS ABOUT MICROSOFT
The European Commission says Microsoft's .NET Passport system may be in
violation of the Commission's data protection law. Passport stores a user's
ID information on company servers so it doesn't have to be reentered as the
user moves from site to site on the Web. The EU is fearful both that
personal data might be passed to unknown parties and also that failure to
register with Passport could exclude people from visiting some sites.

MICROSOFT TWEAKS WINDOWS XP TO COMPLY WITH SETTLEMENT
Microsoft is making changes to its Windows XP operating software to allow
computer makers as well as end-users install non-Microsoft software for
functions such as Web browsing, e-mail and streaming media. The changes
will be released as part of a free update "service pack" later this summer,
and computer makers could start shipping PCs with the reconfigured XP
software this fall. The updated Windows XP also includes some new security
features and other changes, such as support for some of Microsoft's .NET
technology. Microsoft says the new version of XP will comply with a
proposed antitrust settlement signed last year with the Justice Department,
which is awaiting official approval. (Wall Street Journal 24 May 2002)

SECURITY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX
George Washington University law professor Peter Swire calls it "a new
security-industrial complex," alluding to the phrase "military-industrial
complex" made famous in President Eisenhower's Farewell Address. Swire says
that industry is looking at homeland security needs as a lifeline for
getting out of the recession, and here are some of the many security
technologies now being marketed: a variety of automatic face-recognition
systems; electronic body scanners that see through clothing to detect
weapons; biometric cards with embedded computer chips containing personal
ID data, fingerprints, or retinal scans; databases of "trusted travelers"
who could avoid long security lines at airports; and links between
passenger reservation systems to other government and private databases.
Privacy advocates continue to express their concerns that some of these         ***
technologies intrude too much on individual privacy.

ONLINE MOUSETRAPPING
His current whereabouts unknown, Pennsylvania man John Zuccarini has been
ordered by the Federal Trade Commission to pay $1.9 million in compensation
to victims of a Web scam in which set up sites using misspelled names of
popular Web destinations to trap accidental visitors and divert them to
porn and gambling sites. Zuccarini is said to make almost $1 million a year
by charging advertisers who use his services. (AP/USA Today 24 May 2002)

CYBERSECURITY GETS $1.7 BILLION BOOST IN BUDGET
The Bush Administration has included a $1.7 billion increase in
cybersecurity in its proposed budget -- 68% over its current level. Last
fall a congressional survey gave a grade of "F" to 17 of 24 major federal
agencies for their level of security preparations. In the new budget,
overall technology spending by the federal government will increase from
$45 billion to $52 billion, but Department of Commerce undersecretary Ken
Juster notes that 90% of the nation's critical infrastructure (e.g.,
transportation and communication systems and power grids) is privately
owned and operated, and suggests: "The insurance and legal industries
should reward companies" that make computer security "as integral a part
of their business as marketing and product development."

WORLD'S STRICTEST CELL PHONE RADIATION LAW? IN CHINA!
China, which is below international norms for most environmental standards,
is considering strict new regulations that would cut cell phone radiation
emissions by half of what they are overseas. The cost to cell phone makers
would be enormous, because China represents such a huge market for cell
phones and because manufacturers would have to redesign their entire
operations, from R&D to production. Scientific studies have so far failed
to find any evidence that cell phone emissions cause brain cancer, but the
World Health Organization (WHO) has also said that further research is
necessary before ruling out that possibility. (Reuters/USA Today 24 May 2002)

[What Have I Been Saying About Pay-Per-View?]

NETWORKS REALLY WISH YOU'D WATCH THE COMMERCIALS
A survey from NextResearch reports that 20% of the people who own digital
video recorders (DVR) from TiVo or Replay TV never watch any commercials --
a finding that is scaring the advertising and broadcasting industry. Jamie
Kellner of Turner Broadcasting warns that if DVR technology destroys the
economics of paid advertising, the result will be the rapid expansion of
pay-TV: "The free television that we've all enjoyed for so many years is
based on us watching these commercials. There's no Santa Claus. If you
don't watch the commercials, someone's going to have to pay for television
and it's going to be you." And Daniel Jaffe of the Association of National
Advertisers concurs: "You start losing marginal dollars when people who you
thought you were buying are not viewing. This is not just a theoretical
problem that might be happening somewhere down the line. This is happening
now." What should advertisers do? Mollie Watson, a product manager for Best
Buy, thinks their only hope is to do a better job and "put advertisements
out there that people are actually going to choose to watch." Apparently
there are such things. (New York Times 23 May 2002)

VIDEOGAME REVENUES ARE SURPASSING HOLLYWOOD'S
Here's a statistic for you: videogame revenues last year were $9.3 billion,
more than a billion dollars greater than Hollywood's box office total of
$8.1 billion. And Sony executive Kaz Kirai predicts that the game industry
will soon surpass the record industry's $14.3 billion and home video sales
of $19 billion. Let the games continue. (USA Today 23 May 2002)

Headlines From Edupage:

WEIGHT OF ONGOING LAWSUITS TOO MUCH FOR KAZAA
The company that created the Kazaa file-sharing software has said it
will not continue in the ongoing legal battles with the recording
industry. Kazaa BV, which sold the Kazaa software to Sharman Networks
recently, said it cannot afford the legal costs of the battle and will
accept a default judgment from the U.S. District Court in California.
The Kazaa application will continue to operate because of its sale to
Sharman, a move the recording industry sees as a legal maneuver to
shield the company's valuable assets from the litigation. Officials at
Kazaa BV accused the recording industry of lengthy and expensive legal
tactics designed not to address copyright law but to wear down
defendants. Entertainment companies blamed the file-sharing companies
for the costly delays and discounted claims that the file-sharers are
low on money. Streamcast Networks and Grokster, two other file-sharing
companies, are also facing copyright infringement allegations from the
recording industry.

RECORD LABEL SELLS MP3 SINGLE
Maverick Records and Vivendi Universal Net USA have reportedly become
the first major record label to sell an unencrypted MP3 file on the
Internet. For 99 cents, consumers can buy the track, a remix of "Earth"
by bassist Meshell Ndegeocello, and do whatever they want with it--copy
it, trade it, send it over e-mail. Analysts said the label is seeing
how well, if at all, the honor system will work. A spokesman for the
Recording Industry Association of America declined to comment on the
move by its member. Observers said other major record labels will be
watching closely to see the reaction to Vivendi's action, which some
analysts described as a step in the right direction.

CHANGES TO XP ALLOW USERS TO ADD NON-MICROSOFT APPLICATIONS
As part of its proposed settlement last year with nine states and the
Justice Department, Microsoft is modifying the Windows XP operating
system to allow users to install non-Microsoft applications for e-mail,
Web browsing, and others. The settlement has not received formal
approval, and nine other states are still pursuing their anti-trust
case against the software maker. Nonetheless, Microsoft will release a
"service pack" this summer with the changes outlined in the settlement.
Computer manufacturers that build machines with XP as the operating
system will have new options for how they configure the computers they
ship to consumers, though Gateway Inc., Dell Computer Inc., and Toshiba
Corp. are still undecided about exactly what changes they would make.
Consumers who already have computers with XP will be able to download
the service pack or order it on a CD from Microsoft.

MICROSOFT SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE DRAWS MIXED OPINIONS
Microsoft's recent announcement that it would end some pricing
programs for purchasing software and replace them with a subscription
model has upset many and spawned debates about the direction of the
software industry. Many customers have shied away from the subscription
agreements, saying they will cost more and won't provide the level of
flexibility of their current arrangements. Analysts at Gartner have
urged Microsoft customers to take advantage of current discounts on the
subscription service before they expire. According to Gartner, those
who wait risk paying significantly more once the discounts have expired
and the entire pricing structure is migrated to the subscription model.
InfoWorld, 21 May 2002 http://www.idg.net/ic_864909_1794_9-10000.html
Giga Information Group has a less upbeat interpretation of the
situation. Julie Gira, vice president and research fellow at Giga,
said, "The ill will generated with the customer is going to take a long
time to dissipate." Giga cited a report that indicates one-third of
current Microsoft customers are undecided, while another third have a
wait-and-see attitude. Gira conceded that the current licensing program
for software does need to be overhauled, but said the way Microsoft has
handled the change will likely alienate many customers. Her comments
did echo those of Gartner when she said that those who wait may pay
much more later, and that current customers should make a decision
soon, before the deadline arrives.
