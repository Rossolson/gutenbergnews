DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!


Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


We will also have this
new address in Chicago!


Charles Aldarondo
701 Riverside Drive
Park Ridge, IL 60068


Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. <mr_der@hotmail.com> is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

From: Miranda van de Heijning <m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com>
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

Planetary scanning help needed in Yorkshire, England for fragile 19th
century books of A'bp Whately     Please contact:  david@whateley.org
We need a non-destructive method of scanning this delicate material.]

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the 52 weeks of this year, we have produced 2,451 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our *FIRST* 2,451 eBooks!!!

         That's 52 WEEKS as Compared to 29.5 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,733 eBooks online as of January 1, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.48 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.33 when we had 4292 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.85 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 6743 eBooks in 31 1/2 Years We Averaged
    214 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     18 Per Month
     .6 Per Day

At 2451 eBooks Done In 2002 We Averaged
      7 eBooks Per Day
     48 eBooks Per Week
    204 eBooks Per Month !!!

[Time To Start Your Own Software Company?]

SOFTWARE INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION ON THE RISE
The past month has seen a steady flow of software acquisition deals,
possibly heralding the long-awaited consolidation of the software industry,
which has been predicted since the dot-com bubble burst two years ago.
Topping the list are megadeals, like IBM's $2.1 billion purchase of
software tools maker Rational Software Corp. with smaller buys announced by
Veritas Software, which snapped up Precise Software Solutions for $537
million and Jareva Technologies for $62 million, and Yahoo, which announced
its $235 million acquisition of search engine pioneer Inktomi last week.
And while software companies generally are going for bargain-basement
prices, shareholders are still getting a good deal; Yahoo paid Inktomi
shareholders a 41% premium over the value of their shares, and Veritas
offered a generous 37% premium to acquire Precise -- at the high end of the
usual 25% to 35% premiums offered on software deals. Meanwhile, fund
manager Christian Koch says look for more takeovers, with high probability
targets including CompuWare Corp., BEA Systems and Citrix Systems.

EUROPEAN UNION TO RATE VIDEO GAMES FOR SEX AND VIOLENCE
Violent and sexually-oriented computer games sold in Europe will soon be
getting classifications established by the European Union: games with no
sex or violence at all will get a rating of 3+ and all other games will
receive ratings of 7+, 12+, 16+, or 18+. EU secretary-general Patrice
Chazerand says: "It is only fitting that an industry exerting increasing
influence on people displays an enhanced sense of social responsibility."

'SHAKE-UP' CLOSES 3,300 INTERNET CAFES IN CHINA
This summer a deadly fire in the area around Beijing University destroyed
an Internet cafe, killed 25 people, and prompted authorities to close
45,000 establishments, of which 3,300 were never reopened. The fire was
apparently caused by two teenagers angry that they were denied access to
the cafe, but the disaster was used by police officials as a reason to shut
all Internet cafes in China as part of what they called a "shake-up" to
make sure that all such establishments were safe. (Internet World 30 Dec 2002)

GOOD NEWS FOR MOORE'S LAW, BUT BAD NEWS FOR ENGINEERING SCHOOLS
A survey of IEEE Fellows, a collection of elite members of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers found that slightly more than half of
the survey respondents believe that Moore's Law will continue for another
five to ten years. (The Law is named after Intel cofounder Gordon Bell and
it states that the number of transistors in a processor will double every
18 months, thus substantially improving processor speed.) That's the good
news; the bad news is that a full 85% of those same respondents think that
top students are no longer choosing engineering as a profession, because
other fields are more lucrative.

JUDGE IMPOSES INJUNCTION AGAINST DOMAIN REGISTRY
Internet domain registrar Register.com has won an injunction against
the Domain Registry of America (DROA) from a federal judge.
Register.com has accused DROA of violating trademarks and of misleading
domain holders to trick them into changing registrars for their
domains. The judge in the case compared the practice to "slamming," a
ploy used by some phone companies to trick customers into thinking
their phone service had been changed to a new company. A court action
this summer prevented VeriSign from sending similarly misleading
messages to domain holders. Register.com said it will seek significant
monetary damages in the case. A trial date has not been set.

REMEMBER PAYPHONES?
When was the last time you used a payphone? The ubiquity of cell phones has
made them increasingly harder to find, and when you do find one you
probably won't see anyone using it. The number of payphones in the U.S. has
gone down from 2.7 million in the mid-1990s to just 1.9 million now, and
the small companies that maintain those phones are going out of the
business. So buy a few payphones, and see if you can sell them on the
Internet for a profit. (Washington Post 30 Dec 2002)
