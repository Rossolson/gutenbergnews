The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,354 eTexts online as of June 12, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.87 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.82 when we had 3548 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.95 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

CALCULATORS vs. HANDHELD COMPUTERS
As handheld computers become increasingly competitive with Texas Instrument
(TI) calculators for mathematical graphing, TI has been busy adding features
such as address books, organizers, and a large variety of spreadsheet
programs. The main advantage of handhelds, of course, is that they are
general-purpose devices. Nelson Heller, who publishes the Heller Report
newsletter on education technology, says that both calculators and handheld
computers are getting better but adds: "The question I see is whether a
specialized appliance like the graphing calculator will in the long run lose
out to a more generalized appliance like a PDA." Calculators, however, still
have two advantages: lower cost (about half of a PDA's cost) and
acceptability in testing situations, in that students are permitted to use
calculators but not handheld computers when taking the Scholastic Aptitude
Test. The reason? Fear that some students might use the infrared messaging
capability of handhelds to cheat on the test.
(AP/San Jose Mercury-News 12 Jun 2002)
http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3453135.htm

[Of course, this doesn't mean PDA's aren't "better" than calcuators,
it just means that THEY have outlawed them for certain applications.]


IBM BREAKTHROUGH DOUBLES DATA STORAGE
IBM researchers have developed a way to double the amount of data it can
store per square inch, using what essentially are microscopic punch cards.
The new nanotechnology storage system, code-named Millipede, could be
capable of storing 25 million printed textbook pages on a surface the size
of a postage stamp -- about 20 times what is possible with techniques used
in today's hard drives. Millipede uses thousands of nanometer-scale tips to
punch indentations into a thin plastic film, in a technique reminiscent of
the punch cards used decades ago. Unlike the punch cards, however, the
plastic film can be erased and written over through techniques that
transform the heated film back into its original shape. IBM says the new
probe-storage technology could be used to boost the capacity of cell
phones, digital cameras and handheld computers in a few years. (Wall Street

DETECTING CELL PHONES USED AS BUGGING DEVICES
An Israeli company has developed a device that can detect when a room is
being bugged by a modified cell phone, which an intruder could call from
anywhere in the world without it emitting a ringing tone. The phone's
screen remains blank and it appears to be turned off. A co-designer of the
device says, "The beauty of the cell phone as a bug is that it's an
innocent looking and ubiquitous object. People trust cell phones, but
modified and left in idle mode the cell phone can be used as a transmitter
for up to a week. If it's connected to a power supply it can provide
endless intelligence. Professional bugsweepers will ignore the cell phone
frequency since the phones are so common and not suspicious."

ONLINE AUCTIONS THE NEWEST WAY TO FENCE STOLEN GOODS
Online auctions such as eBay are the newest way to fence stolen property,
because they're so anonymous and so simple. A Santa Clara prosecutor says:
"There's no need for the pawnbroker. Internet auctions have suddenly become
a really easy way to fence stuff." But law enforcement officials agree that
eBay is extremely diligent in helping authorities track down criminals, by
running sophisticated anti-fraud operations and by helping prosecutors
build legal cases. An executive of the National Consumer League reminds us:
"As we always say, if the deal is too good to be true, it usually isn't."

DYSON SAY ICANN HAS BECOME 'A REAL CESSPOOL'
Esther Dyson, tech celeb and former chair of ICANN (the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), told an audience at the
Wharton business school that "ICANN has become a real cesspool," because
of its tangled disputes about authority, accountability, and openness.
The independent agency is in charge of managing policy for the Internet's
name and address systems. "When I was a young student, I thought grown-ups
would come and make things work. Now I realize that grown-ups are just kids
with wrinkles. I only see juvenile behavior at ICANN."

DANISH PUBLISHERS PROTEST DEEP LINKING
The Danish Newspaper Publishers' Association is suing a news Web site that
provides links directly to news stories, without going through the site's
home page. Newsbooster editor-in-chief Nicolai Lassen says linking directly
to the story saves the reader time: "From the home page down to the actual
story you want to read can be a very, very long way. By using a technology
such as Newsbooster, you save a lot of time." Newsbooster charges users a
subscription fee to send links to news items containing user-designated
keywords, and the Danish Newspaper Publishers' Association believes that it
should either shut down or negotiate to share those fees. "We consider it
unfair to base your business upon the works of others," says the group's
managing director. But to Internet purists, the whole point of Web is to
create linkages between relevant pages. If the Web's creators hadn't wanted
linking, "they would have called it the World Wide Straight Line," says one
Web site operator. In the U.S., early court decisions have sided with
deep-linking, except in cases of framing, where a site tries to make
information created by other sites appear to be its own. "It was one of
those issues that people thought was more or less settled. For whatever
reason, these last couple of months, a spate of new disputes have come up,"
says an Internet legal expert. (AP 10 Jun 2002)

APPLE NIBBLES AT WINDOWS MARKET
Apple Computer is thinking "different" about how to lure new customers, and
is launching an advertising campaign aimed at potential "switchers" --
computer users who might be coaxed into dropping Windows PCs for Apple
Macintoshes. The new, multimillion-dollar campaign, dubbed "Real People,"
features testimony from individuals, some of them celebrities, talking
about why they recently converted from PCs to Macs. In one spot, a man
describes the Window desktop as "the blue screen of death," and in another,
a man says using Windows was like "being stuck in a bad relationship."
Apple CEO Steve Jobs says the Windows market is an obvious place to start
recruiting new Mac users: "There are a lot more people out there that use
Windows computers than no computers, so that's a very rich target for us.
For those thinking of switching to the Mac, we'd like to help that process
along." Nevertheless, Jobs downplays any hint of discord between the two
companies: "We have a really good relationship with Microsoft right now.
The way I look at it is, what's a few points of market share between
friends?" (Wall Street Journal 10 Jun 2002)

IS THERE A LAW THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO WATCH COMMERCIALS?
Surely there isn't -- says Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) in his support for a
consumer lawsuit seeking to confirm that users of Sonicblue's ReplayTV
system have the lawful right to skip commercials when they record  TV
programs for later viewing. The suit has been filed in the same federal
court in Los Angeles that is hearing a complaint from movie and television
studios that ReplayTV allows customers to violate their copyrights, arguing
that skipping commercials amounts to stealing. Sonicblue's position is:
"Basically we believe that consumers have 'fair-use' rights, and everything
consumers do with a ReplayTV is covered with 'fair use'."

STUDENTS PROVIDE BULK OF TECH SUPPORT IN SCHOOLS
Fifty-four percent of U.S. schools rely on students to provide technical
support for their computer systems, according to a report titled "Are We
There Yet?" (http://www.nsbf.org/thereyet/index.htm), released yesterday by
the National School Boards Foundation. In 43% of the 811 districts
surveyed, students troubleshoot for hardware, software and other problems,
and 39% of the districts, students are tasked with setting up equipment and
wiring. Nearly as many districts also report that students perform
technical maintenance. The fact that students are providing so much
hands-on assistance is viewed as a "win-win" situation by John Bailey,
director of education technology for the Department of Education. Their
tech savvy helps compensate for a dearth of tech support funding in school
budgets and teachers who are "unevenly prepared for using technology as a
tool for teaching and learning," according to the NSBF, which reports that
69% of the survey respondents rated new teachers as average or novices in
computer skills. The role reversal signals a shift in the relationship
between teachers and students as online lessons become integrated into the
school curriculum, says Anne Bryant, executive director of the National
School Boards Association: "Teachers become the guide on the side, instead
of the sage on the stage." (AP 5 Jun 2002)

PC GLUT PROMPTS PRICE CUTS
PC makers are engaging in an unusually aggressive round of price cuts in
response to the industry's recent dismal sales results. April sales were
off 22.5%, compared with a year earlier, according to NPDTechworld, as the
industry badly misjudged consumer demand for higher-powered machines. As a
result, the number of unsold PCs is reaching unprecedented levels, with
some companies reporting up to nine weeks' worth of inventory stashed in
retailers' warehouses. The pressure to reduce inventory is exacerbated
further by the coming release of highly integrated chips and newer
software. For computer buyers, this confluence of unfortunate events all
adds up to an unusually good buying opportunity. "This is a really, really
unique time in retail," says an analyst at market watcher ARS. "Intel is in
the position of announcing new chips and manufacturers have this inventory
problem." (Wall Street Journal 6 Jun 2002)

patrons with access to reference librarians worldwide. The service
refers questions submitted through a library Web site to librarians who
can offer help. Libraries that subscribe to QuestionPoint can choose
either or both of two levels of service. The first works with a
library's own staff or that of regional consortia to route questions.
The other level of service sends questions through the Global Reference
Network, an international group of libraries.

CONSUMERS GROUP SUES OVER TV RIGHTS
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed a lawsuit in federal court
to try to establish the legality of devices that let consumers watch
television programming without commercials and send copies of programs
over the Internet. The suit names as defendants many of the media
companies that recently sued SonicBlue, the maker of one such device.
Media companies, which are concerned about their revenue from
advertising, argue that watching programs without commercials is
tantamount to theft and that transmitting an entire program over the
Internet, as happens now with music files, is a violation of
intellectual property rights. An attorney with the Electronic Frontier
Foundation said there's a difference between being in a movie theater
and in one's living room, and that the entertainment industry is
trying to control consumers' personal habits.

UK NEGOTIATES SOFTWARE COSTS, CONSIDERS OPEN SOURCE
The Office of Government Commerce (OGC), an agency of the U.K.
Treasury, in March signed a contract with Microsoft that will
reportedly save taxpayers $147 million on software over the next three
years. The move came after the agency realized that separate
departments had formerly negotiated Microsoft contracts with large
differences in cost. The united front for negotiations not only will
save money but also opened the door for discussions about products from
other vendors, including open-source software products. A spokesman
from the OGC said he expects something concrete to emerge soon from the
discussions about open source. Critics said the government is merely
talking about changes and should do more to promote platforms such as
Linux. The government's focus, they say, is money rather than security.
