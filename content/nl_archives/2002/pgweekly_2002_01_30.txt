the Eastern Hemisphere for the next few weeks, so you will need to find
the new files with the filenames rather than our search engines. . . .

Some of our Production Coordinators who do nearly an eBook per day
could use a little help now and then, as we are on the verge of our
first 200 eBook month, and thus they have been somewhat overworked.
If you can help with just one eBook per week or per month, email:
Brett Fishburne <william.fishburne@verizon.net>
[He could also use some C++ and UNIX programming help]


We need some volunteers who can do the most basic copyright research,
basically just looking to see if either the publication date or the
copyright date is before 1923.  For legal purposes we should probably
ask for librarians or other professionals for this.

If you need to follow-up on materials sent in for copyright research,
contact Michael Hart at hart@pobox.com.  Also send him a message if
you recently sent in an etext to be posted, and haven't seen it yet.
You can send a copyright scan to Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>
or as a .jpg only to Dianne Bean <pg_research@yahoo.com>.

Reminder, Greg is away this week, so try Dianne.

DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory
B. Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

collection, view http://promo.net/pg/list.html

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
of North America.  For information about how to set one
up, contact Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

***

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Choose a mirror of the Project
Gutenberg collection near you.

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

<http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>
or
<ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

***

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 01/30/02**:  4450
(This number includes the 40 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

In the first four weeks of the new year, we have produced 158 new etexts.

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,450 eTexts online as of January 30, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.25 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.21 when we had 3112 Etexts A Year Ago

PALM UNVEILS NEXT-GENERATION HANDHELD
Palm has rolled out its second-generation i705 model, which features
always-on, secure wireless e-mail access through its Palm.net service. The
lightweight (6 oz.) device will cost about $449 and comes with a built-in
fixed antenna and radio chip. Palm's first-generation devices, the VII and
VIIx, were designed for Web access rather than for real-time, or "push"
e-mail. The i705 enables users to receive messages as they're sent, without
repeatedly logging onto a Web site. Service charges start as low as $19.99
a month and go up to $39.99 a month for unlimited messaging. (Wall Street

NAPSTER LAWSUIT ON HOLD WHILE PARTIES RECONSIDER SETTLEMENT
U.S. Federal District Judge Marilyn Patel has granted a request by Napster
and four record companies to suspend for 30 days the lawsuit brought by the
record industry charging Napster, the Internet music-swapping service, with
illegal distribution of copyrighted material. The four record companies
joining Napster in the request were AOL Time Warner, BMG, Vivendi Universal
and Sony; a fifth company, EMI, declined to participate in the request.
Napster is gradually transitioning itself from a free to a
paid-subscription service, and Hilary Rosen of the Recording Industry
Association of America says of Napster: "We understand they have limited
their repertory to licensed music. Resolving the lawsuit may now be
feasible." (New York Times 24 Jan 2002)

'SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION' THEORY TESTED VIA E-MAIL
A team of researchers at Columbia University is testing a theory posed by
social psychologist Stanley Milgram that says everyone knows everyone else
in the world via just a few intermediaries -- the so-called "six degrees of
separation." Back in the pre-Internet days, Milgram tested his hypothesis
using the U.S. mail to distribute packages to several hundred randomly
selected people in the Midwest and directing them to get them delivered to
target people in Boston. Each recipient was given some details about the
target and was asked to send the package on to an acquaintance who might be
more likely to know the target personally. In the electronic version of the
experiment, mathematician Duncan Watts has devised an e-mail campaign that
solicits participants to sign up on a Web site. "Ideally, we'd like to
have, say, 100,000 people, each trying to reach around 20 targets," he
says. Early tests show, however, that only one in four e-mail messages is
being passed on. "Perhaps people can't be bothered to pass them on -- or
perhaps Milgram was just wrong. Either way, we need lots of people to take
part so we can tell." (New Scientist 23 Jan 2002)

BROWSER WARS, PART 2
AOL Time Warner has filed an antitrust suit against Microsoft, seeking
damages for harm suffered by Netscape during the "browser wars" of the late
1990s. Netscape didn't divulge how much money it was seeking, but last
summer some AOL lawyers privately estimated that the number could be as
high as $12 billion -- an amount termed "laughable" by Microsoft lawyers.
The claiming of damages "will be done at trial, not in the filing," said an
AOL spokesman. The lawsuit also seeks an injunction "to prevent further
antitrust injury to Netscape and to restore competition in the market for
Web browsers," in addition to fostering the ability of "middleware"
software to compete with Microsoft operating systems. One person close to
the situation said Netscape may seek to force Microsoft to offer PC makers
a stripped-down version of Windows that doesn't include Internet Explorer.
"The potential damage claims will be phenomenal," said one lawyer, who's
been tracking the case. "Netscape is clearly going to claim not only that
it ended up losing the browser battle with Microsoft, but they lost many
related battles," such as Internet server software. In addition, AOL's move
may embolden other aggrieved parties, such as Sun Microsystems, which is
weighing whether to file its own private lawsuit over actions Microsoft
took against Sun's Java programming language. Microsoft refused to comment
on the merits of the lawsuit, saying "AOL Time Warner has been using the
political and legal system to compete against Microsoft for years. Every
chance they get, they choose litigation over innovation. Where Microsoft
invests in new products, AOL is investing in lawyers and lobbyists to put
roadblocks in Microsoft's way," according to a company spokesman. (Wall

ID THEFT AND WEB SCAMS TOP CONSUMER COMPLAINTS
The most consumer fraud complaints in 2001 revolved around
identity theft and Internet scams, according to an FTC report
issued on Wednesday. ID theft accounted for 42 percent of the
complaints sent to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel database last
year, while fraudulent online auctions accounted for 10 percent
of complaints, and deceptive Web and computer services accounted
for 7 percent. The FTC's Hugh Stevenson said the last category
includes ISP trial offers that are difficult to cancel and have
vague terms; equipment purchased over the Web; and Web design
and support services with undisclosed site charges. He said the
204,000 fraud complaints the FTC received last year represent
an almost 100 percent increase over the previous year. "Some
of what this reflects is increased outreach and increased
willingness to report fraud," he noted.

NEW BILL OF RIGHTS FOR THE DIGITAL AGE
A group of CIOs, in conjunction with computer vendors and AMR
Research, has released the Software Bill of Rights. The document
establishes basic standards for software, including product
quality, accurate delivery schedules, unambiguous pricing,
development accountability, and strong customer support.
"There's a high level of frustration over software quality,"
said Bob Parker, a research fellow at AMR. In addition,
maintenance and integration activities can represent up to 50
percent of software costs, according to AMR. IT departments
should simplify such activities in order to reduce costs, said
Parker, allowing more resources to be used on other areas.

AOL SUES MICROSOFT OVER TACTICS ON BROWSER
AOL Time Warner has filed a lawsuit against chief competitor
Microsoft on behalf of its Netscape Communications division,
alleging that Microsoft damaged the unit's fortunes by using
illegal stratagems that cut off the distribution channels for
its Navigator browsing software while giving Microsoft's
Internet Explorer the edge. "Netscape's lawsuit is a logical
extension of the [court] findings...that Microsoft thwarted
competition, violated the antitrust laws, and illegally preserved
its monopoly at Netscape's expense," said AOL general counsel
Randall J. Boe. The suit will help the efforts of state
prosecutors' involved in the ongoing antitrust suit to amend
Microsoft's business practices, including the unbundling of
Explorer from the Windows operating system. Explorer currently
controls about 80 percent of the browser market. The monetary
damages AOL is seeking have not been specified.

IN TOUGH TIMES, TINY WEB SITE LURES HARVARD GRADS
Recent college graduates facing a bleak economy in the middle
of a recession may find employment at SparkNotes, a startup
that provides academic materials similar to CliffsNotes on
the Internet. Harvard's director of career services William
Wright-Swadel describes SparkNotes as being "like consulting,
a quintessential liberal-arts career path: It requires analysis,
reading, writing, and teaching somebody." More than half of the
company's 20 full-time workers graduated from Harvard, as did
about 50 percent of SparkNotes' roughly 150 part-time and
freelance writers. Although SparkNotes writers do not make a lot
of money, they appreciate the job's flexibility, which gives them
more time to pursue personal projects. Barnes & Noble, which
acquired SparkNotes last March, intends to start publishing and
selling print versions of its crib sheets by the end of 2002.
