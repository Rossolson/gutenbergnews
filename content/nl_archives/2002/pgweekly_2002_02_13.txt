Just as I was expecting a quiet week, records continue to be set!

The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, February 13, 2002

eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet

We added #4600 today. . .still have about 50 reserved.

1,389   New eBooks Since A Year Ago
3,170   eBooks This Week Last Year
4,559   Tree-Friendly Titles Now Online

   67   New This Week!!!
   42   New Last Week
   44.5 Weekly Average This Year!!!
   67   New This Month!!!
  267   New This Year!!!
   18   New This Week Last Year


I should add that the Internet Public Library, which also includes our
listings, is approaching 20,000, currently at 19,260.  The IPL may try
to post #20,000 on my birthday, March 8, and it appears PG may do 5000
before our planned date of July 4th, our 31st Anniversary, if we go at
this rate much longer. . . .

IPL is at:  http://www.ipl.org/reading/books/

I should also add that on this date 10 years ago, there were only some
19-20 eBooks available for free download. . .which means that for each
eBook available 10 years ago, there are now 1,000. . . .

That would mean 20 million in just 10 more years, if we keep going!!!


Main URL is promo.net/pg Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
Check out our Websites at promo.net/pg & gutenberg.net. . .for INSTANT
access to this files, please see below, as our Chief Cataloguer is in
the Eastern Hemisphere for the next few weeks, so you will need to find
the new files with the filenames rather than our search engines. . . .

NOTE:  Some of our search engine functions are not working properly,
so though ALL of our entries up to and including the last Newsletter
have been catalogued, many of the search engine results do not work.
So you might want to practice up with our INSTANT access FTP, below.

I still need an email address for Kenna Therrien, for copyright.

Did anyone back up the Naked Word site before it died. . . ?

Thank you so much for your responses, we found several backups!

PROOFERS NEEDED:  As many proofers as possible are needed to
proof files containing checkmate positions in FEN notation.
The proofers need to identify board positions which are not
checkmates!  Reply to Brett Fishburne <vze22fdi@verizon.net>

If you find an e-text on the web and need to find a matching pre-1923 edition
to correct it and get copyright approval. . .or if you live near a library
with at a million books and are willing help people find matching editions?
Please email contact Charles Aldarondo (Aldarondo@yahoo.com) and he will try
to connect people lacking a large local collection with whose who have the
means to help from their local collections, and he will explaining the process
of finding/comparing/correcting/submitting such eBooks to Project Gutenberg.

If anyone has the time and inclination to do so, Faust(Part 1)
by Goethe (etext02/faust10.*) could use a good proofreading.

Anyone with a music background who might be interested
in helping out with the Gutenberg Classical Music Project
please contact:  Geof Pawlicki <gpawlicki@earthlink.net>

. . .

Some of our Production Coordinators who do nearly an eBook per day
could use a little help now and then, as we are on the verge of our
first 200 eBook month, and thus they have been somewhat overworked.
If you can help with just one eBook per week or per month, email:
Brett Fishburne <william.fishburne@verizon.net>
[He could also use some C++ and UNIX programming help]

We need some volunteers who can do the most basic copyright research,
basically just looking to see if either the publication date or the
copyright date is before 1923.  For legal purposes we should probably
ask for librarians or other professionals for this!!!

If you need to follow-up on materials sent in for copyright research,
contact Michael Hart at hart@pobox.com.  Also send him a message if
you recently sent in an etext to be posted, and haven't seen it yet.
You can send a copyright scan to Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>
or as a .jpg only to Dianne Bean <pg_research@yahoo.com>.

DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory
B. Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

For a list of mirrors (copies) of the Project Gutenberg
collection, view http://promo.net/pg/list.html

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
of North America.  For information about how to set one
up, contact Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

***

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Choose a mirror of the Project
Gutenberg collection near you.

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

<http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>
or
<ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03>

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

***

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 02/13/02**:  4,559
(This number includes the 43 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

In the first six weeks of the new year, we have produced 267 new etexts.

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,559 eTexts online as of February 13, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.19 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.15 when we had 3170 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.96 less a year later???

COMCAST RECORDS SURFING MOVEMENTS OF ITS SUBSCRIBERS
Comcast, the nation's third-largest cable company and a provider of
high-speed Internet access to a million computer users, says it has begun
recording the Web surfing movements of its subscribers in order to improve
its technology and services. Admitting that it began the monitoring without
notifying its customers, the company said it believes its actions are
permitted by the language in their service agreements with subscribers, and
insists that "Comcast absolutely does not share personal information about
customers, and we have the utmost respect for our customers' privacy."
Privacy advocates are upset about the Comcast action, and Internet security
expert (and Comcast customer) George Imburgia says: "I'm furious."
(AP/San Jose Mercury News 12 Feb 2001)

can subpoena these records, even if you surfed from home. . . .]

YOU CAN SURF, BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE
As the number of network-connected devices grows at home, in the
office, and on the road, presence technology is becoming more
powerful and pervasive. Instant messaging is by far the most
popular of these technologies, allowing users to tell when
others are online, or even when they have not engaged their
computer keyboard or mouse for several minutes. Mobile phone
makers are expecting to include presence technology in their
next-generation phones that would let callers know beforehand if
their contact is available or if their phone is even on. In the
future, devices equipped with Global Positioning System technology
would allow friends to know when they are within a couple blocks
of one another. Privacy concerns and social complications plague
presence technology, even with privacy controls included in Yahoo!
and MSN instant messaging products.
(New York Times, 7 February 2002)

"DIGITAL DIVIDE" PLAN IN PERIL
Two grant programs aimed at helping poor citizens take advantage
of technology would be discontinued under President Bush's 2003
budget proposal. The Technologies Opportunities Program funds
state and local initiatives to bridge the digital divide. One
initiative teaches computer skills to elderly residents of
Washington, D.C.'s Shaw neighborhood. "The people who are the
most isolated from technology are the urban poor elderly," said
David Domenici, executive director of the See Forever Foundation.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA) wants to divert funding to national defense and other
priorities in the wake of the national crisis, according to NTIA
deputy director Michael Gallagher. Meanwhile, the Department of
Education's Community Technology Centers program is also facing
dissolution because the administration has labeled it one of
many "small category programs that have limited effect,"
explained a department spokesman. The budget proposal also
calls for a 45 percent reduction in high-tech research grants
to corporations and universities.  (Washington Post, 5 February 2002)
