      Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 06/19/02**:  5,387
(This number includes the 74 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 24 weeks of the new year, we have produced 1,095 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our *FIRST* 1,095 eBooks!!!

             That's 24 WEEKS as Compared to 26 YEARS!!!

Here's what we were doing around #1095:

Nov 1997 King Henry VI, Part 1, William Shakespeare   [WL] [1ws01xxx.xxx]1100
Nov 1997 The Riverman, by Stewart Edward White             [rvrmnxxx.xxx]1099
Nov 1997 The Turmoil, A novel, by Booth Tarkington  [BT#5] [turmoxxx.xxx]1098
Nov 1997 Mrs. Warren's Profession, by G. B. Shaw [Shaw #4] [wrproxxx.xxx]1097

Nov 1997 The Faith of Men, by Jack London  [London #27-34] [fthmnxxx.xxx]1096
Nov 1997 Light of the Western Stars, Zane Grey    [Grey #4][lwstrxxx.xxx]1095
Nov 1997 Tamburlaine the Great PT 1, by Christopher Marlowe[tmbn1xxx.xxx]1094
Nov 1997 The Beast in the Jungle, by Henry James[James #15][bstjgxxx.xxx]1093


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended our production year.

With 5,387 eTexts online as of June 19, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.86 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.80 when we had 3567 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.94 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

MICROSOFT TAKES 1 JAVASTEP FORWARD, 1 JAVASTEP BACK
The latest step in Microsoft's long-standing race with Sun Microsystem's is
Microsoft's decision to include in the newest version of Windows XP a
version of Sun's Java software. The hitch is that Microsoft has chosen for
this purpose a version of Java that is five years old, and says it will
remove Java completely when its licensing agreement with Sun expires at the
beginning of 2003. Java allows a programmer to write a single program able
to run on different operating systems. (San Jose Mercury-News 18 Jun 2002)

'TOOTH PHONE'
Engineers in the UK say they've developed a tooth implant that incorporates
a tiny vibrator and a radio wave receiver, and is capable of functioning
like a tooth-based cell phone. The implant does not yet have its own
microchip installed, but inventors James Auger and Jimmy Loizeau say the
technology has been tested, and that a fully functional phone is feasible.
Sound, received as a digital radio signal, would be transferred to the
inner ear by bone resonance, enabling information to be received anywhere
and at any time, with no one else the wiser. The invention raises the
possibility of financial traders receiving the latest stock market updates
while taking in a movie, or politicians receiving a secret briefing on the
issues while being quizzed by reporters. (Reuters 18 Jun 2002)

BRITISH "BIG BROTHER" DEBATE
Following fierce objections by civil libertarians and Conservative Party
politicians, the British government has shelved a plan to extend to local
governments the reach of a two-year old law allowing monitoring by police,
tax authorities and security services for reasons of national security or
serious crime prevention. Lord Strathclyde, Conservative leader in the House
of Lords, said: "We support the war on terrorism [but] we oppose district
councils being given power to survey private communications. Surely this
distressingly authoritarian government can see the difference."

THE STATE OF INTERNET RADIO
The viability of Internet radio will be in danger if the Library of
Congress -- which oversees the U.S. Copyright Office -- sets music
royalties too steep. Royalty rates and detailed reporting requirements
proposed earlier this year by a panel of arbitrators (and rejected without
comment last month by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington) would have
bankrupted many Webcasters. A new decision is expected this week. Broadcast
radio stations in the United States pay about 3 percent of their revenue as
royalties to music publishers, but are not required to pay performers; in
contrast, Webcasters have to pay additional royalty to performers under
terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.

TELECOMMUTING STILL GAINING IN POPULARITY
The number of U.S. workers toiling at home three or more days a week rose
nearly 23%, from 3.4 million in 1990 to 4.2 million in 2000, according to
U.S. Census figures. Meanwhile, the estimated number of workers who
telecommute at least some portion of the week jumped more than 42% in two
years, from 19.6 million in 1999 to 28 million in 2001, according to the
International Telework Association and Council (ITAC). Most telecommuters
live in New England and on the East and West coasts in areas with dense
population and notorious traffic congestion, and more than two-thirds of
telecommuters polled for an ITAC survey expressed satisfaction over their
at-home worker status. "They're saying, 'This is three hours I don't need
to be in the car, and I could be with my kids, pick (up) the dry cleaning,
or whatever,'" says ITAC president Tim Kane. A formal E-Worker program
instituted two years ago at Cigna Corp. has seen productivity increases of
up to 15% among teleworkers while job turnover rates in some divisions of
the company were cut in half. (AP 16 Jun 2002)

MUSIC DOWNLOADERS MAY BE RECORD LABELS' BEST CUSTOMERS
Four out of five people who download music from the Internet report that
their CD purchasing frequency either remained the same or increased,
according to a new study by Ipsos Reid that concludes downloading music and
burning CDs may actually stimulate legitimate sales. The research backs up
an earlier study by Jupiter Media Metrix that concluded people using
file-sharing networks were more likely to spend money on music. "While the
goal of this " was not to draw a link between file sharing, CD burners and
the slump in music sales, we can see that American music enthusiasts are
becoming increasingly acquainted with the flexibility that digital music
allows," says a senior research manager at Ipsos Reid. "As a result,
(American consumers) may be more apt to venture beyond the traditional
channels of music distribution as part of their audio behaviors."

RESEARCH FIRM SAYS PC SALES ON THE UPSWING
The technology research firm IDC is predicting that worldwide PC sales will
rise by 3-4.7% in 2002 and 11% in 2003. By contrast, in 2001 worldwide PC
shipments dropped 4% to 134 million units. IDC expects that the recent
merger of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq will put the new HP in the top
position for number of PCs sold in 2002. (AP/USA Today 13 Jun 2002)
http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/invest/2002/06/13/pc-sales.htm
[For those of you who hate the way statistics are presented, this would
likely mean that about 1.5 billion PC's would be sold in this decade.
This is about one per family for the entire world, but obviously there
will still be a Digital Divide as some countries move past 50% of their
families having a PC, as the US already did, and others barely get started.]

UK WEB SITE GUIDES LEGAL SNOOPERS
The British government has set up a Web site to advise qualified UK
government departments and organizations how to stay within legal
bounds in carrying out covert surveillance of British citizens' use of
their telephones, fax machines, Web browsers, and e-mail accounts.
Passage of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act in 2000 made it
easier for customs, tax, police, and intelligence services to get
permission to spy on criminals and citizens. The RIP Act removed the
requirement to obtain permission for surveillance from a judge and put
approval and oversight into the hands of the Office of Surveillance
Commissioners.   BBC, 17 June 2002

CAMPUS E-MAIL EXPOSED TO PUBLIC SCRUTINY
Many states identify administrators and professors at public colleges
as state employees, potentially exposing their letters, documents, and
e-mail to public scrutiny under freedom-of-information laws. Some
institutions have begun to update policies to safeguard personal e-mail
or warn professors to be careful what they write. Open-records laws
don't specify clearly whether professors' research notes, lecture
notes, or regular mail would qualify as public records, but most states
assume that state employees' e-mail messages are public records, even
when the law is ambiguous. Employees at private colleges can be exposed
as well, although not through open-records laws; a person would need to
obtain a court order or a subpoena, requiring involvement in litigation
against the college./Chronicle of Higher Education, 17 June 2002 (sub. req'd)

MICROSOFT MODIFIES CAMPUS LICENSING
In response to criticism from college administrators, Microsoft plans
to offer alternatives to three features of its Campus Agreement
licensing program. The new options will take effect July 1. The changes
reportedly permit more accurate financial forecasting through a
three-year lease, include server as well as desktop licenses, add
work-at-home licenses for most desktop software, and provide more
options for purchasing software licenses for students.

BEIJING CYBER CAFES CLOSED
Mayor Liu Qi has ordered the closure of all Beijing cyber cafes after a
fire killed at least 24 people and injured 13 others at the Lanjisu
Cyber Cafe. The mayor also suspended new licences for cyber cafes
awaiting safety inspections. Most of the victims of the fire were
students, taking advantage of the cyber cafe's inexpensive late-night
Internet rates.

CONGRESS SCRUTINIZES ICANN
Members of Congress on Wednesday said they would increase oversight of
the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), though
there are no plans to take control of the organization. Since it was
awarded control of most of the domain-name system in 1998, ICANN has
been the subject of ongoing controversy, and many government officials
agree that ICANN needs to revise many of its policies and procedures.
ICANN's current contract expires in September, and some have hinted
that if acceptable reforms are not put in place, the contract may not
be renewed. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Nancy Victory defended some
of ICANN's contentious actions and said that even if another group
were running the domain-name system, the same problems would have to be
dealt with.     New York Times, 12 June 2002 (registration req'd)

UK WORRIES OVER PERSONAL PRIVACY
Privacy advocates in the United Kingdom reacted harshly this week to
the government's announcement that the list of organizations allowed
to obtain records of users' personal information would be
significantly expanded. Under the former terms of the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act, only law enforcement officials could legally
access such information as Web usage and records of e-mail or telephone
communications. The new rules allow 24 more organizations access to
this data. Privacy groups worry that many of the non-law enforcement
agencies are not prepared to handle private information securely and
that there will be new and widespread opprtunity for abuse. Concerns
were also raised over new provisions that allow access to personal
information without consent from a judge. Now, such access can be
granted by an agency's senior managers.   BBC, 11 June 2002
