***Project Gutenberg wins the Stockholm Challenge Award***


The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation from the U.S.
won the 2002 Stockholm Challenge Award in the category "Culture."
The project received the prize at an award ceremony at the
Blue Hall in Stockholm City Hall, venue of the Nobel Banquet.

As a Stockholm Challenge Award winner last Thursday, The Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was presented the Stockholm
Challenge trophy that symbolises the technological progress in
harmony with nature and the environment.

The project set out in 1971 to prove the feasibility of the eBook
concept and encourage creation and distribution of free eBooks.
Today Project Gutenberg has produced over 6,000 eBooks, of the
20,000+ listed by the Internet Public Library, and has mirror sites
on every continent, including Antarctica. About 1,500 volunteers hope
to produce about 2,400 more eBooks in 2002, nearly twice as many as
the 1,240 they created in 2001.  For every one of those, similar
organisations create three more, aiming to convert all materials
entering the public domain in every language into free eBooks.
By their 7,000th eBook, Project Gutenberg hopes to have included
examples of books in 20 languages, and already has one eBook that
contains selections translated into over 75 languages.

Project Gutenberg's original goal was to create ten thousand eBooks
and get them to one hundred million people, thus giving away a total
of one trillion eBooks.

Given that this goal may possibly be achieved by the end of 2003,
Project Gutenberg is in the process of restructuring toward a new
goal of getting one million eBook titles to one billion people,
for a total of one quadrillion eBooks to be hopefully given away
by the end of the year 2015.

In total, 8 winners in 6 categories were awarded by the Mayor of
Stockholm, Mr. Carl Cederschild, in the Stockholm City Hall, one
of the most renown buildings in the world as it hosts the annual
Nobel Prize banquet.  This year IT projects from 78 countries
throughout the world were nominated in the Stockholm Challenge.

The Stockholm Challenge Award focuses on the positive effects of
the information society, trying to bridge what is usually called
the Digital Divide. The 28 member international jury looks for
exemplary use of information technology that has an impact on
public lives. The Stockholm Challenge Award is a non-profit
initiative of the City of Stockholm. Participating projects
are private, public or academic.


We were happy to see that bookshare.org won in Education.
They distribute Project Gutenberg books, and focus on providing
literature in Braille and other formats to the blind.

CIA FACT BOOK READY FOR FORMATTING

The 2002 edition of the CIA World Fact Book is now
available at http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html
Project Gutenberg needs a volunteer to harvest and reformat
this work into plain text (HTML is optional).  See our previous
WFB's for formatting idea.  Interested?  Email gbnewby@ils.unc.edu

***

If we could get a volunteer to scan them in a similarly large size
to the other Alice illustrations, then I could have a go at producing
an illustrated version of "Through the Looking Glass".
[This would require scanning about 50 illustrations]

***

If you go to the Cigna web site and click on the pink ribbon, Cigna will
donate $1.00 to fight breast cancer.  Only good the month of October.
[Warning, I heard they were overloaded, and shut down the site. . .]



PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING PRODUCTION COORDINATORS

Do you like working with different file formats and character sets,
have skills with text editors, know a little Unix?  Can you handle
receiving large file attachments by email?  Do you have a passion for
making Project Gutenberg's eBooks look as good as possible, from
receiving a file from a volunteer through uploading and announcing it
to the world?

If so, please email gbnewby@ils.unc.edu or hart@pobox.com.  We are
currently seeking one or more new Production Coordinators, who work
for at least 5-10 hours per week to format, edit and upload Project
Gutenberg's eBooks.  This is tough work, but highly rewarding and varied.

Statistical Review

In the first 41 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,853 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,153 eTexts online as of October 2, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.62 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.50 when we had 4006 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.88 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

UK GOVERNMENT PLANS CELL PHONE TOWER TRACKING SYSTEM
The government of the U.K. is funding secret radar technology research that
uses mobile phone masts to enable security officials to watch vehicles and
people in real time almost anywhere in Britain. The Celldar technology,
which works wherever there is cell phone coverage, "sees" the shapes made
when radio waves emitted by the towers meet an obstruction. Signals bounced
back by immobile objects, such as buildings and trees, are filtered out by
the receiver, and what's left on the screen are images of anything that
moves. When combined with technology that allows individuals to be
identified by their mobile phone handsets, the Celldar system would enable
security officials to locate and track a specific person from hundreds of
miles away. An individual using one type of receiver, a portable unit a
little bigger than a laptop, could even create a "personal radar space"
around his or her location for security purposes. Researchers are also
working on an "X-ray vision" feature that would enable the devices to "see"
through walls and look into people's homes. UK Ministry of Defence
officials are hoping to introduce the system as soon as resources allow,
appalling idea. The government is just capitalizing on current public fears
over security to introduce new systems that are neither desirable nor
necessary," says Simon Davies, director of Privacy International.

GADGET TRANSLATES BABY'S CRIES
Spanish engineer Pedro Monagas has come up with the answer to many new
parents' prayers -- a pocket-sized device that interprets a baby's crying
so that the parent can respond appropriately. The battery-powered "Why Cry"
device contains a microchip that monitors volume, pattern and interval to
determine if the baby is tired, hungry, sleepy, uncomfortable or stressed
out. "My own son Alex was always crying and after night after night of not
very much sleep I decided I had to find a way of finding out what he was
trying to say to me -- if only for my own sanity," says Monagas, who spent
three years visiting nurseries and analyzing the crying patterns of around
100 babies. Some child-rearing experts have expressed doubts about the
machine and one pediatrician notes that "Why Cry" won't do anything that
mother, will tell you they are capable of telling the difference between a
hunger cry, a cry of pain, or an overtired cry with reasonable accuracy.
What can a machine offer that a parent can't?" Monagas says his device
boasts a 98% accuracy rate, and will be available at Spanish pharmacies by
the end of the month, priced at 95 euros. (BBC News 15 Oct 2002)

FORGETFUL BOOMERS SPAWN MARKET FOR MEMORY AIDS
A stream of new products is hitting the shelves, aimed at solving one of
that always seem to go missing just when you're in a hurry to leave. The
products range from a FINDIT keychain that beeps after the user claps three
times to the Sharper Image's "Now You Can Find It!" -- a collection of
plastic tags that can be attached to potentially elusive items, and then
beep when users hit a button on the central device (of course, for it to
work, users must make sure not to misplace the central device). The device
and tags communicate with each other via radio frequency waves, and require
that the user be within several meters of the hidden object's location. A
handful of companies are also marketing GPS-enabled "kid finder" watches
and pagers, and plans are underway to put homing devices on everything from
luggage to pacifiers. Most ambitious of all, perhaps is the DIPO device,
made by a French company of the same name, that not only finds an object
but notifies the owner if it is about to be left behind. The central device
-- the size of a small cell phone -- checks every few seconds to ensure
that all tagged objects are within a certain radius -- say, five meters. If
it notices that the tag on the Palm Pilot, for instance, has moved outside
the radius, it will beep or vibrate to remind the user to take it along.
DIPO started out as the brainchild of the company's absent-minded CEO,
Bruno Enea, who says, "I kept losing my credit card. I always forgot my
passport. I realized I had to do something about this problem."

Headlines From Edupage:

NEW RESTRICTIONS FOR CHINESE INTERNET CAFES
The Chinese government has announced a new set of Internet cafe
restrictions, which will go into effect November 15. China already has
a host of restrictions on Internet cafes and on content available
online, but the government has added new rules after a fire in August
killed 25 in an Internet cafe. Under the new rules, smoking is banned,
cafes cannot operate within 124 feet of a school, and cafes must close
by midnight. Operators of cafes also must register users and track what
content they access. These rules are added to already strict
regulations concerning content that the government deems politically
subversive, such as information about Tibet and Taiwan, as well as
online gambling and pornography.

PEER-TO-PEER EFFORTS AIM TO DEFEAT CENSORSHIP
Several peer-to-peer efforts aim to allow users in countries that block
certain Internet content to access that content with the help of users
in uncensored countries. One such effort, called Peekabooty, responds
when a user in a country with censorship tries to access a site that is
blocked. The user sends a request to the Peekabooty community, and a
computer in a country without restrictions will send that content,
encrypted to sidestep filters, to that user. It's just a theory so
far, because the current version lacks the encryption tool and is
reportedly very buggy. Still, so-called "hacktivists" involved in the
initiative, as well as others working in projects including Hacktivismo
and SafeWeb, argue that breaking down censorship in countries like
China and Iran is an important and noble cause.
