Project Gutenberg is happy to be a finalist in the Stockholm
Challenge (http://www.challenge.stockholm.se).  On October 7-10, in
the city of Stockholm, Sweden, there will be events and festivities
culminating in an awards ceremony on October 10.

We are seeking someone to attend these events to represent Project
Gutenberg, preferably someone who lives in Europe.

If you are interested in this opportunity to represent Project
Gutenberg, please email hart@pobox.com

***

Requests For Assistance:

Can anyone here find a pre-1923 English edition of the Gilgamesh Epic?

***

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czeck by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

The Distributed Proofreading Team is proud to annouce that they have
now completed over 400 e-texts! Stop on by and give us a hand with
the next 400! http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg

We currently also have eBooks needing proofing in German and Spanish.

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

***

A new mailing list "gut-tv@listserv.unc.edu" has been added.
This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free
eBooks This Week" which highlights the free eBooks posted in the
past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help
write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

Personal Request:

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the 37 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,685 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,977 eTexts online as of September 11, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.67 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.57 when we had 3896 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.90 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 35% less a year later???

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

INTERNET 'INDISPENSIBLE' TO TODAY'S STUDENTS
Eighty-six percent of today's college students are hooked up to the Web,
and 79% say being online has had a positive influence on their lives
overall, according to the latest survey from the Pew Internet and American
Life Project. Not surprisingly, nearly three out of four college students
check their e-mail every day and use the Web for library research. A
majority of students report improved relationships with classmates, thanks
to the Internet, and nearly half say that using e-mail allows them to voice
an idea to a professor that they likely would not have expressed in class.
And while the high-speed connections on most college campuses do enable
more media downloading, students use the Internet just as frequently for
academic purposes, making use of course-related mail lists, e-mail and Web
sites. "Today's 18-year-old college freshmen were born the same year as the
PC was introduced, and they have grown up with these technologies," says
the report's author, Steve Jones. "To them, the Internet and e-mail are as
commonplace as telephones and television -- and equally as indispensable.
This generation is going to end up making the Internet a major part of

LINUX IN THE CORPORATE WORLD
The Linux operating system, which has already found a secure place in
academic and government computing environments, is becoming increasingly
attractive to corporate information technology managers seeking less-costly
alternatives to the offerings of Microsoft and Sun. IBM is now expanding
its foray into the corporate Linux world, by announcing a multi-year
alliance with Red Hat, the largest company in the marketplace that sells
professional support for Linux, an "open-source" product available free
(without support). Alliances such as these will ease the fears of corporate
IT managers concerned about the compatibility issues of unsupported
software. (New York Times 16 Sep 2002)

CHINA ENDS BLOCKING OF GOOGLE
Chinese authorities have ended their policy of preventing citizens in that
country from accessing the Google search engine, which is especially
popular there because of its ability to make it easy to find
Chinese-language material online. In its usual style, the government gave
no indication of why it was removing the restrictions (nor, for that
matter, why it had imposed them in the first place). But censorship in
China continues, as evidenced by an increase in selective blocking, which
prevents visitors to a Web site from seeing specific items which the
government finds politically incorrect. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 12 Sep 2002)

Headlines From Edupage:

DEAL WITH RED HAT WILL INCREASE IBM LINUX OFFERINGS
IBM and Red Hat are expected to announce a deal that would
significantly increase the number of IBM products--hardware and
software--that use the Linux operating system. The deal also creates
joint marketing initiatives between the two companies, targeted at big
business customers. Early adopters of Linux tools came mainly from
academia and government, with large corporations watching from the
sidelines. The new effort from IBM and Red Hat is designed to convince
big business that the cost savings from using Linux do not come at the
expense of reliability, scalability, or compatibility.

INTERNET USE SURPASSES LIBRARY USE ON CAMPUS
A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project indicates that
more U.S. college students use the Internet for academic work than use
the campus library. According to Steve Jones, head of the
Communications Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago and
author of the study, students have come to regard high-speed Internet
access as a utility, just like water or phone service. The study showed
that students use the Internet for research more often than they used
the library, but they also use it for communication, both with peers
and with professors. Other results showed that 85 percent of college
students own computers, and most of them prefer to access the Internet
from home.
