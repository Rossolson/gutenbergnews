*The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, November 27, 2002*
******eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Over 31 Years******


When Project Gutenberg completed eBook #100, The Complete Shakespeare,
on December 10th, 1993, all the pundits said we couldn't possibly keep
pace with Moore's Law, doubling every 18 months!  In fact, they said
not even huge concerns such as Intel CPUs could keep up, but specifically
that Project Gutenberg, an any other human based work enterprise,
could not possibly keep up with Moore's law.


Here is the Moore's Law prediction from Dec. 10, 1993 to Dec. 10, 2002:

9 years, doubling once ever 18 months would be a total of 6 doublings:

Total   Date  Doublings

 100 Dec 10, 1993   0
 200 Jun 10, 1995   1
 400 Dec 10, 1996   2
 800 Jun 10, 1998   3
1600 Dec 10, 1999   4
3200 Jun 10, 2001   5
6400 Dec 10, 2002   6

[In fact, we have kept up with Moore's Law even longer than that,
back to 22 eBooks in Dec., 1991 and 10 in Dec., 1990, Moore later!]

Over Our 31 1/3 Year History, We Have Now Averaged About 200 Ebooks/Year--
And This Year Averaged Nearly That Same 200 eBook Level. . .PER MONTH!!!!!

And!!!

!!!100th eBook of 2002 for Project Gutenberg of Australia!!

Australian Discovery is eBook number 100 for 2002 (we work on calendar years
at PGofOz). The book is particularly relevant to Australians as it is a
compilation of extracts from the original journals of the land and sea
explorers who discovered and then opened up Australia for settlement.
The eBook is also available as an online resource and is accessible from
http://gutenberg.net.au/explorers. There are 34 journal extracts and
more than 30 maps and illustrations, together with an introduction to both
land and sea exploration by the author, Ernest Scott.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

Statistical Review

In the first 47 weeks of this year, we have produced 2,111 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,403 eBooks online as of November 27, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.56 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.41 when we had 4006 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.82 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

LIBRARY FILTERS BAN THE LIBRARY
An Ohio library found itself blocked on its own system after
it installed net filtering software.  The Flesh Public Library
had its own site blocked after the program blocked sites with
the word "flesh".  Rather than considering the implications
of the software, the library simply changed its name.

Headlines From Newsscan

[This site done with $4.4 million in NSF grants, etc]
[Anyone willing to help write grant proposals for PG?!]

CHILDREN'S BOOKS FREE ON THE NET
A new Web site, designed by the University of Maryland and the nonprofit
Internet Archive are creating the International Children's Digital Library
-- a site that eventually will hold about 10,000 children's books from 100
different cultures and make them available free for downloading. "There are
places in the world where you're going to find a computer way before you
find a library or a book store," says project director Jane White. The
site's goal is to stimulate children's reading and learning skills while
exposing them to a variety of other cultures. It features kid-friendly
graphics that enable a user to click on an icon and view thumbnail-sized
pages of a book that unwind or unfold like the panels of a comic book. The
site, www.icdlbooks.org, officially debuted Wednesday, offering 200 titles
from more than 27 cultures in 15 different languages. Many of the titles,
such as "Alice in Wonderland," are no longer under copyright restriction,
but some publishers, including Random House, Scholastic and HarperCollins,
have contributed a few newer works as well. Currently, users must have a
broadband Internet connection to access the site, but the site will be
available for dialup modem users by next summer. (AP 20 Nov 2002)

[Finally, a speed limit on bandwidth hogs, who slow things down for all]

HIGH-SPEED ISPs CONSIDER PUTTING ON THE BRAKES
Many of the largest high-speed ISPs are considering capping the amount of
bandwidth that their subscribers can use each month in an effort to put the
brakes on rampant file-swapping. "Every major broadband provider is
seriously weighing pros and cons of bandwidth consumption caps," says
Michael Harris, president of research firm Kinetic Strategies. Leading the
way is Bell Canada, whose DSL service has already instituted caps on
bandwidth use, charging subscribers about 80 cents for each extra 100
requires ISPs to set up a traffic-monitoring system for each account and it
forces the subscriber to self-ration bandwidth -- a foreign concept to
people accustomed to an all-you-can-eat approach to Internet use. Critics
note that unwanted content, such as pop-up ads and pornographic spam, could
waste subscribers' bandwidth, but Bell Canada says its policy has been a
success so far. The company offers tiered levels of service allowing 2GB,
10GB and 20GB of monthly traffic, and the percentage of customers exceeding
their allotment in any given month is small -- between 6% and 8%. Cable
companies are eyeing the Bell Canada experiment with interest, as their
subscribers in particular are adversely affected by "bandwidth hogs."
Meanwhile, the president of file-swapping company Grokster dismisses the
efforts, saying, "They only thing they're going to accomplish is to make
their customers angry." (CNet News.com 26 Nov 2002)

ANTIVIRUS TOOL THROTTLES DOWN ON INFECTION RATE
Matthew Williamson, a researcher at the Hewlett-Packard labs in the UK, has
developed a new approach to battling computer viruses. It slows down the
infection rate significantly by limiting the number of connections at any
one time by an infected computer. "The major problem with computer viruses
is that because they spread so quickly and our response is so slow, they
cause so much damage," says Williamson. "We are tackling the fundamental
nature of a virus^E When your machine gets an e-mail virus, it sends lots
and lots of e-mail messages at a much higher rate than you would normally
send them. So if I put a limit on the rate of e-mail messages that you can
send in every 10 minutes, then a virus trying to send 100 or 200 messages
will very quickly get delayed." Williamson found that using the "throttle"
technique has a negligible impact on the day-to-day performance of his
computer. (BBC News 26 Nov 2002)

COMPUTERS RANK TOPS AMONG DIGITAL APPLIANCES
Half of the respondents in a recent Harris Interactive survey said their
computer was the most important electronic device in their household,
beating out CD players, cell phones and DVD players (the study did not ask
[Of course, most of their televisions would not be in "digital" categories]
people about their television use, however). The 2002 International Digital
Lifestyle poll targeted people in Europe and the U.S. who own a computer
and at least one other digital device -- a prime target for consumer
electronics manufacturers. "We're seeing a lifestyle shift from almost
exclusive television use to a higher percentage of people's lives spent on
a computer," says Dell marketing director Mike Oldani (the Harris study was
backed by Dell and Microsoft). When asked about what they did with their
computers, the younger crowd (18- to 34-year-olds) used theirs for
listening to music; people in the 35 to 49 range cited job-related tasks;
and the over-50 group enjoyed e-mail the most. (CNet News.com 24 Nov 2002)

TECH FIRMS, HOLLYWOOD HEADED TO NEGOTIATING TABLE
About 20 lobbyists representing technology and entertainment companies are
headed for a closed-door meeting today to try to hammer out some of their
differences in the long-running squabble over digital copyright. Companies
Verizon, the Business Software Alliance, AOL Time Warner, the Motion
Picture Association of America and the Fox Entertainment Group. "We're
pleased that so many people who are important players in this debate are
willing to sit down with us to discuss the consumer perspective on digital
copyright," says Alan Davidson, deputy director of the Center for Democracy
and Technology, which is sponsoring the series of meetings. "We don't know
what the outcome will be, but we're hopeful that we can make progress in
representing what has been an underrepresented voice -- consumers."
Political tension between the two groups has increased significantly in the
last year, which has resulted in an impasse. (CNet News.com 21 Nov 2002)

WEB SITES LEAK AFTER-HOLIDAY SALE PRICES
Users of several shopping Web sites, including FatWallet.com and
DealofDay.com, were treated to a sneak peek of post-Thanksgiving sale
prices for items ranging from Kodak digital cameras to the "8 Mile" movie
soundtrack -- prices retailers had no intention of revealing until after
the holiday. Now, shoppers in the market for an HP printer may as well wait
until the price drops to $200 after Thanksgiving -- 33% off the current
price on the OfficeMax Web site. And Best Buy's price on a digital camera
will drop to $99.99 from its current $149.99 listing. "Someone, somewhere
is getting information they shouldn't be," says an OfficeMax spokesman.
Target, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and others have demanded that the Web
sites take the information down. Most have complied, but in many cases
readers have already copied the data and posted it elsewhere on the Web.
Retailers are stumped over how the information got out, but promise to take
action as soon as we discover how the information got on the site and who
posted it," says a spokesman for OfficeMax. (Wall Street Journal 21 Nov 2002)

MICROSOFT IS NO. 1 IN ONLINE BRANDS
Microsoft ranks as the leading online brand, just slightly ahead of AOL
Time Warner, according to a Digital Media Universe survey conducted by
Nielsen/NetRatings. Yahoo, the U.S. government and Google occupy the
remaining slots in the Top Five brands. In order to calculate the rankings,
DMU tracking "combines Web-based traffic with Internet applications and
browser channel audience data, including measurement of AOL proprietary
channels, instant messaging applications, media players, ISP applications
(non-browsing), wireless content systems, Web phones, news and information
toolbars, connected games, weather applications, auction assistants and
shopping assistants." Rounding out the Top Ten online brands were Terra
Lycos, About-Primedia, RealNetworks, Amazon and eBay.(EuropeMedia 22 Nov 2002)

SWAPPING MUSIC ONLINE CAN'T BE STOPPED, SAY RESEARCHERS
A paper prepared for an Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)
workshop on Digital Rights Management dismissed record industry
attempts to stop swapping of music files over online networks as
unworkable. The authors wrote that the continuing proliferation of
file-swapping systems and improvements in their organization will
eventually make them impossible to shut down. The spread of CD and DVD
burners and the growth of consumer broadband, inexpensive data storage,
and instant messaging further erode attempts to control consumer use of
music files. The authors advised music companies to compete on the same
terms, by making music easy and inexpensive to buy.

GOVERNMENT SHUTS DOWN PUBSCIENCE
The United States Department of Energy shut down PubScience, an
Internet site that catalogued government and academic science research,
in response to corporate complaints that it competed with commercial
services. Searching on PubScience was free, with the service linking
either to free full texts or to payment systems for information that
was for sale. Two commercial equivalents also offer free searching,
with academic literature available for a fee. Researchers worry that
commercial companies will control access to and charge fees for
information and research that was created with public money. Closing
PubScience will save the government $200,000 a year.

JUDGE WARNS OF EXPANSION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW
Speaking at a lecture organized by the American Enterprise Institute
and the Brookings Institution, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Richard Posner
warned of an "enormous expansion" of intellectual-property law. Posner
criticized a 1998 law extending the duration of U.S. copyrights and
attacked the Patent and Trademark Office for granting what he called
"very questionable" business method patents. Posner is known for
applying economic analysis to the law and for mediating settlement
talks in the Microsoft antitrust case.
