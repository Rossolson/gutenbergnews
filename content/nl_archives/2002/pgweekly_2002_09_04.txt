Project Gutenberg is happy to be a finalist in the Stockholm
Challenge (http://www.challenge.stockholm.se).  On October 7-10, in
the city of Stockholm, Sweden, there will be events and festivities
culminating in an awards ceremony on October 10.

We are seeking someone to attend these events to represent Project
Gutenberg, preferably someone who lives in Europe.

If you are interested in this opportunity to represent Project
Gutenberg, please email hart@pobox.com

***

Requests For Assistance:

Can anyone here find a pre-1923 English edition of the Gilgamesh Epic?

***

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czeck by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

The Distributed Proofreading Team is proud to annouce that they have
now completed over 400 e-texts! Stop on by and give us a hand with
the next 400! http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

A new mailing list "gut-tv@listserv.unc.edu" has been added.
This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free
eBooks This Week" which highlights the free eBooks posted in the
past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help
write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

Personal Request:

I am looking for a keyboard for my Visor Edge.

The only one I am SURE will work is the:

PA810U Targus

but there may be others.

I have tried to order many times, nothing ever arrived.

Thanks for any assistance you can provide!

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

(This number includes the 88 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the 35 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,572 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,872 eTexts online as of September 4th, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.70 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.61 when we had 3806 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.91 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Edupage:

DOING LAUNDRY ONLINE
New technology from IBM and USA Technologies will allow college
students to do laundry without hunting for quarters or sitting around
in the laundromat waiting for their clothes to be done. The eSuds
system will connect 9,000 washers and dryers at U.S. colleges and
universities to the Internet. Students can check a Web site for
available machines and add detergent that the machines dispense. When
the laundry is done, the machine sends an e-mail notifying the student.
Swipe cards are used to pay for the laundry instead of cash, and
laundromat owners can use the system to monitor machines and perform
limited maintenance. The system might also cut down on vandalism, since
cash won't be collected by the machines.

DOUBLECLICK TO PAY FINE, MODIFY PRIVACY POLICY
Online ad provider DoubleClick Inc. has agreed to modify its privacy
policy and pay a $450,000 fine after a 30-month investigation into the
company's handling of consumer data. DoubleClick's ads use cookies to
track users' surfing habits, and privacy groups had accused the
company of abusing the information it collected. Under the agreement,
DoubleClick will make user profiles available to consumers, verify its
compliance with the settlement, and pay the fine. Web sites that permit
DoubleClick ads to collect user information must state this in their
privacy policies. Consumer data will no longer be shared without
permission from individuals, and DoubleClick is developing a tool for
users to review the data the company has collected on them.
