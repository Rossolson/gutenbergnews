Request for Assistance:

Project Gutenberg needs help getting its news releases
to the right people.  We'd like to use BusinessWire
(http://www.businesswire.com) but it's very expensive.
Does your organization use BusinessWire?  Might they pay
to distribute Project Gutenberg news releases?  If you have
connections or ideas to help get the word out to national
and international media organizations, please email me.

We are still collecting more media email addresses!!!

     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 05/01/02**:  5,152
(This number includes the 70 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 17 weeks of the new year, we have produced 851 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our *FIRST* 851 eBooks!!!

Mar 1997 Democracy and Education, by John Dewey [JDewey #1][dmeduxxx.xxx] 852
Mar 1997 Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson [crmmrxxx.xxx] 851

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year for 2001, so the 9th was the end of the first production week.

With 5,152 eTexts online as of May 1, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.94 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.91 when we had 3441 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.97 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

INSTANT MESSAGING TO BE NEXT E-COMMERCE CHANNEL
Better use of instant messaging technology by online merchants could help
e-tailers address the problem of shopping cart abandonment. Too often,
shoppers give up on an e-commerce purchase simply because they can't find
the answer to a very simple question, says Gartner research director Rob
Batchelder. "Web sites have horrible problems with shopping cart
abandonment rates. Having instant messaging, in many instances, could have
saved that sale. It's spontaneous, and it fits right into the flow of the
transaction." He suggests that the technology could be used as part of a
range of personalized services designed to encourage customer loyalty and
to stimulate more frequent shopping. (E-Commerce Times 26 Apr 2002)
http://www.ecommercetimes.com/perl/story/17345.html

BROADBAND STATS
Broadband service is getting more expensive, and consumers are getting
increasingly reluctant to spend the extra money to convert from dialup to
Internet service. In the last quarter of 2001, monthly cable modem service
rose to $44.22 (up 19% year-over-year); DSL prices rose 7% to $51.67.
Industry analyst Mark Kersey of ARS says, "If prices keep going up while
the economy is going down, you have a perfect recipe for slowing broadband
growth." And that slowdown is already being seen. In DSL service, for
example, Verizon signed up 13% more new customers last quarter, down from
23% growth in 4th quarter 2001; in the same quarters, BellSouth growth
dropped from 34% to 17%. (USA Today 25 Apr 2002)

CELL PHONES WITH FEELING
A research team at the MIT Media Lab has developed a prototype latex cell
phone that can transmit a caller's "squeeze" using tiny pressure sensors
that replicate the feeling on the receiving end. Developer Angela Chang
says that within a few minutes of being handed the phones, students testing
the devices were using the vibration feature to add emphasis to what they
were saying or to interrupt the other speaker. "It was pretty easy to
communicate, though we didn't specifically pre-arrange codes," says one of
the students who tried out the phone. Chang predicts "vibralanguages" that
could take off the same way that text messaging did among young people, and
for much the same reason -- people sometimes want to communicate without
anyone overhearing what they're saying. "And imagine actually being able to
shake someone's hand when you close a business deal," she says. (New
Scientist 24 Apr 2002)

AOL A DRAG ON AOL TIME WARNER
Media giant AOL Time Warner has announced a $54-billion net loss for the
first quarter of 2002, the largest quarterly loss in U.S. corporate
history, and the culprit is largely the slowing growth in AOL's base of
online subscribers and the general collapse of the online advertising
market. Richard D. Parsons, the incoming CEO of the company, is putting on
a brave face; a former lawyer and banker who developed his career on the
"old media" Time Warner side of the house, he promises: "I want to assure
you that as CEO I will be focused on producing results, quarter and after,
that will put us at the top of our peer group. AOL Time Warner is a big,
dynamic company, and our online business is only one part of the whole. My
focus is on maximizing the results across the entire company. (New York
Times 25 Apr 2002)http://partners.nytimes.com/2002/04/25/technology/25AOL.html

MICROSOFT OUTMANEUVERS STATES' ATTORNEYS
Microsoft lawyers said they would not call eight of the remaining 17
witnesses on their list, denying attorneys for the nine litigating states
the opportunity to enter critical evidence before the court. Four of the
witnesses are Microsoft employees, including Richard Fade, the executive in
charge of relations with computer manufacturers. Opposing attorneys had
hoped to elicit potentially damaging testimony from Fade during cross
examination after he admitted in his pre-trial deposition that computer
makers were concerned that new licensing arrangements would infringe on
their intellectual property rights. In addition, witnesses from third
parties such as Best Buy and Charter Communications, will not be appearing
following the poor performance by previous witnesses from Advanced Micro
Devices, Unisys and Qwest. (Financial Times 1 May 2002)

RADIO SILENCE SIGNALS ROYALTY PROTEST
Many Web radio stations will be participating in a "Day of Silence" today
in protest of a proposed royalty deal that they say could drive many
Webcasters off the Net. Organizers say hundreds of online stations will
replace their usual programming with public service announcements,
discussions of the new fee structure, or just plain silence. The proposed
royalty deal would require Web-only non-interactive commercial stations to
pay $0.0014 per listener per song, while commercial stations that broadcast
both online and over the air would be required to pay $0.0007 per listener
per song. The Library of Congress is expected to make a decision this month
on the fees. (Los Angeles Times 1 May 2002)

WIRELESS STATE OF THE ART: MORE JUNK AT FASTER SPEEDS
Among the problems facing the wireless industry now are generally slowing
revenues, inflated claims, and vacuous content. Revenues: Spending on
wireless network equipment expected to be down another 10% this year.
Inflated claims: Although third-generation (3G) wireless communications are
always described as "incredibly fast," Gartner VP Ken Dulaney warns: "Any
time you read a speed number from an operator, don't believe it. It's
probably one-fifteenth of what they say." Vacuous content: "More junk, but
at a faster speed," is the way Gartner's Phil Redman describes the
situation. Playing games, checking sport scores and stock prices. Ho-hum.

BERNIE WHO? WORLDCOM LOOKS FORWARD TO LIFE AFTER EBBERS
Replacing Bernie Ebbers, who just resigned as chief executive of WorldCom,
John Sidgmore denies that the company is a candidate for bankruptcy and
promises that the can be an "engine for growth again." The Ebbers
resignation had come under pressure because the company he founded and
built with more than 60 acquisitions is now $30 billion in debt, facing a
federal investigation of its accounting practices, and battered by slowing
sales and sinking stock prices. Sidgmore exudes optimism: "Our confidence
level is high. I would not have taken this job if I thought we would be out
of business next week." But there are plenty of skeptics who will need to
be convinced. Industry analyst Adam Quinton of Merrill Lynch says simply:
"A change of CEO does not change the debt load or the challenging operating
environment. " And Allegiance Telecom CEO Royce Holland, whose former
company, MFS Communications, was bought by WorldCom, says:  "It's a short
distance from the penthouse to the outhouse."  (USA Today 30 Apr 2002)

Headlines From Edupage

SDMI FADES INTO HISTORY
Four years ago the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) was created
by members of the music and technology industries to put an end to
illegal copying and distribution of electronic music files. The goal
was to create digital protections that would prevent music from being
played by unauthorized users. But changing technologies and consumer
demand for freely traded files ultimately overcame the efforts of SDMI.
One of the early members of SDMI today says that "SDMI may have been
the wrong medicine for anything." New efforts to control the illegal
sharing of music have taken the form of government legislation,
including a recent bill from Sen. Hollings, and efforts from a new
group called the Digital Media Device Association.

APPLE GOES AFTER EDUCATION MARKET WITH NEW MACHINE
Apple Computer, which has the largest installed base of computers in
schools in the United States, has introduced a new computer, the eMac,
targeted at regaining some of the ground it has lost recently,
especially to Dell. Dell has attracted many education customers, due to
low prices for powerful machines, and because of the dominance of
Windows-based software. The eMac is built around a 17-inch CRT monitor
in a single unit, similar to the iMac introduced in 1998. Steve Jobs
said CRTs were chosen over LCD screens for cost considerations. Prices
for the eMac range from $999 to $1,999; they will not be available to
consumers, but teachers can purchase them for their homes.

RIAA ASKS FOR INCREASED FUNDS TO FIGHT PIRACY
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) this week asked a
Congressional subcommittee for increased funds for federal efforts to
fight piracy. The RIAA called for more funds specifically for a new
program called Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (CHIP), part
of the Department of Justice's efforts to combat cybercrime. The RIAA
expressed concern that the focus of CHIP is hacking and requested that
Congress make intellectual property the top priority for CHIP.
Representatives from the Motion Picture Association of America also
testified at the hearing, with both groups highlighting the economic
losses resulting from piracy of protected material.

MPAA STARTS NEW EFFORTS TO PROTECT MOVIES
The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has begun a new effort
to keep copyrighted movies off of file-swapping networks. Movie
industry representatives said that almost every film they release ends
up on file-swapping networks, some even before the movie has been
officially released. Officials from the MPAA will send letters to
offenders' ISPs asking that the companies help to stop the sharing of
pirated movies. The most egregious violators will be reported to the
Justice Department. Some ISPs have removed illegal files from their
networks, though they said it is difficult to target users who have
files on their own computers. Other options for the MPAA include
technologies that purport to obstruct peer-to-peer sharing by flooding
networks with bogus messages and files.

HOTMAIL COOKIES ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN PASSWORDS
Though designed to allow quick identification of users for personalized
services, cookies increasingly are being used by some Web sites for
authentication purposes. According to Eric Glover, a New Jersey-based
computer programmer, if someone is able to steal two Hotmail cookies
from your computer, that person can gain access to your Hotmail
account, even if you change your password. At Hotmail, the information
contained in cookie files can be used to acces an account even after
the password has changed. Making matters worse, security experts agree
that gaining access to a user's cookie files is typically a "trivial"
task. Microsoft said it has several measures in place to guard against
"cookie-based replay attacks." Security experts, however, said that for
users who want the convenience that cookies can provide, it will be
very difficult to protect against attacks.

CONGRESS HEARS CONCERNS OVER WEB RADIO ROYALITES
A recent recommendation by the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel
would require Web radio stations to pay royalties for each song played.
Many small radio stations, including many owned by colleges and
universities, complained that the fees could put them out of business.
This week, a group of Congressional representatives voiced opposition
to the recommendation, which they said would significantly impede the
industry. The representatives said that the royalty fees run counter to
the intent of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The U.S. Copyright
Office is expected to vote May 21 on the recommendation.
