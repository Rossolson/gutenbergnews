From England's "The Enquirer"

"Project Gutenberg. . .the most significant group literary undertaking
since James Murray. . .create[d] the Oxford English Dictionary."
The Enquirer [UK] by David Moynihan [webmaster of Blackmask Online]

Gutenberg was launched in '71 by Michael Hart, the first regular
citizen to get on what became the Internet. Beginning with an e-mailed
Declaration of Independence, the sending of which nearly crashed the
network of that time, PG grew slowly over the next 30 years into what
is now the most significant group literary undertaking since James
Murray teamed up with family, friends and casual passersby to create
the Oxford English Dictionary. But while Murray died before OED was
complete, Hart has a real good shot of seeing his original objectives
realized. It's likely PG's 10,000th book will be added sometime in
2003 (they've got over 6,000 currently).

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

***

Third Request for Alice

If we could get a volunteer to scan them in a similarly large size
to the other Alice illustrations, then I could have a go at producing
an illustrated version of "Through the Looking Glass".
[This would require scanning about 50 illustrations]

***

David R. <mr_der@hotmail.com> is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Third Request!

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the first 47 weeks of this year, we have produced 2,005 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,297 eBooks online as of November 13, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.59 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.44 when we had 4006 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.85 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

E-MAIL ADDRESS CHURN GIVES E-TAILERS HEARTBURN
Almost a third of U.S. Internet users change their e-mail addresses each
year, costing businesses millions in potential sales, according to a new
study by NFO WorldGroup. Reasons cited for changing e-mail addresses
include changing jobs, switching ISPs, or evading spam. Recently, 87% of
total respondents had changed a personal e-mail address and 35% had changed
a work address. At least 16% said the change was intended specifically to
shake off spammers whose tactics have become increasingly aggressive and
subject matter increasingly offensive. The high turnover rate has caused
headaches for legitimate businesses, however, who lose contact with
customers who may have volunteered their e-mail addresses as part of the
business relationship. "It's too much of a hassle to update their personal
information with the sites," says an NFO marketing manager. "They look at
it and think if they have to go through this process with 20 Web sites,
it's too much trouble. Whereas with contacting 20 friends, that's a
different thing." Return Path, an e-mail change-of-address company,
estimates that e-mail churn cost businesses between $3 billion and $4
billion in 2000 due to lost sales, wasted e-mail acquisition marketing and
unnecessary e-mail delivery costs, with those losses rising to $10 billion
to $20 billion in five years. (Wired.com 12 Nov 2002)

COLLEGES URGED NOT TO MONITOR PEER-TO-PEER SHARING
The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a Washington-based
nonprofit organization that promotes freedom of speech on the Internet, is
attacking letters recently written by the recording industry asking college
officials to monitor Web use at their institutions for copyright violations
made through peer-to-peer sharing of music or video files by members of the
academic community. EPIC is criticizing those letters for trying to shift
the burden of content enforcement to academic institutions which have
scarce resources for such purposes, and is warning against a network "arms
race" between file sharers and copyright enforcers. The group thinks
colleges should avoid adopting a "confrontational role with respect to
these technologies," because all it would do would be to harm the network's
overall performance. (IDG News Service 11 Nov 2002)

Headlines From Edupage


LETTER URGES UNIVERSITIES NOT TO MONITOR FILE SHARING
In response to a recent letter from members of the entertainment
industry to colleges and universities, encouraging them to use
technological means to monitor and limit file sharing on their
networks, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has sent a
letter urging institutions not to engage in such monitoring. The EPIC
letter argues that monitoring could violate student privacy, expose the
institution to liabilities under the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act, and constrain the "marketplace of ideas" that the schools
embody. A representative from EPIC said the group thought the
entertainment industry was "reasonable" in asking schools to try to
limit piracy of copyrighted material but had gone too far in supporting
monitoring. A response issued by the Recording Industry Association of
America said universities do not need to be lectured about "academic
freedom ... or [the] privacy rights of their students."
