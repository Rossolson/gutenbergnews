--Update On Music Site

Gutenberg Music Web Site Launch  [NEW EMAIL ADDRESS] gpawlicki@earthlink.net

Project Gutenberg is proud to inaugurate the Music Website
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music/ as the principle outlet for the Chamber
Music Archive. You'll find free scores and parts of public domain music,
digitized in a variety of printable, playable and editable formats.
The initial postings are classical chamber music, including quartets by
Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn and Brahms in Coda Music's Finale (.MUS) format.
For further information regarding procedures, the files, and the site,
please see entries in the FAQ
<http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music/music_helpex.html>
and Volunteer <http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music/music_volunteer.html> pages,
or contact Geof Pawlicki <MAILTO:geof@ibiblio.net> directly.

--Project Gutenberg in Portugal

We have received word from Joao Marques in Portugal that there will soon
be a Project Gutenberg site in that country, that will be similar to the
Project Gutenberg site in Australia, allowing the people of Portugal to
access Ebooks which are in the public domain in that country.  This is
still in early development, and we will provide more details as soon as
they become available.

And a huge PG welcome to the new associates in Portugal!

***

--Requests for Assistance:

Programmers familiar with the Palm OS are needed to help write a
freeware application which will allow the contents of
GUTINDEX.ALL (all the books loaded into Project Gutenberg) to be
synched to a Palm (or similar) handheld computer.  This would
allow volunteers to check whether a book is already in the system
before picking one up at a library or garage sale.  Additionally,
the system is intended to allow volunteers to track texts they
have acquired and are in the process of preparing for Project
Gutenberg.  Please contact William Fishburne
(william.fishburne@verizon.net) if you are able to help.  Access
to a compiler which can generate code for the Palm OS and/or a
compiler for generating conduits (PC, Mac, Lynix, Beos, whatever)
would be necessary.  Thanks!


We Have Included Quick and Easy Ways to Donate. . .As Per Your Requests!


We Are Looking For Volunteers To Add eBooks In More Languages,
and in more formats, including music, artwork, movies, etc.

DETAILS ON DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory

"Project Gutenberg" as your donation recipient, and send
a portion of online shopping expenses to Project Gutenberg.
If you know of additional affiliate programs, please email
donate@gutenberg.net

Project Gutenberg does not endorse or partner with any particular
affiliate program.  We know that they can be awkward to use and
often ask for extensive personal information.  But we also know
that they are a good fit for some donors.

       Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 07/03/02**:  5,508
(This number includes the 77 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 26 weeks of the new year, we have produced 1,216 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our *FIRST* 1,200 eBooks!!!

              That's 26 WEEKS as Compared to 27 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,508 eTexts online as of July 3rd, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.82 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.82 when we had 3548 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.99 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???
