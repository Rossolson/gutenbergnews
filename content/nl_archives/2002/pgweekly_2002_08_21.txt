Requests For Assistance:

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czeck by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>.

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

David Widger would like to complete the works of Edward Bulwer Lytton for
Project Gutenberg and has two bookshelves of these books scanned--but he is
running out of steam.  He will mail a printed book and email the raw text
file ready for proofing to anyone who would like to produce one of these
books giving any guidance needed to those who are new to the game.

Many Thanks!

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

A new mailing list "gut-tv@listserv.unc.edu" has been added.
This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free
eBooks This Week" which highlights the free eBooks posted in the
past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help
write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Correction From Last Week's Newsletter:

My apologies, even though we all agreed on the numbers up to
the last moment, apparently I counted one too many as the last
other totals should also obviously be one less.  Was 5749 total.

(This number includes the 85 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)


In the first 33 weeks of the new year, we have produced 1,490 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,790 eTexts online as of August 21th, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.73 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.64 when we had 3782 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.91 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

GROUP WARNS OF EU SURVEILLANCE
Statewatch, a U.K. group dedicated to protecting civil liberties on the
Internet, is warning that European governments are planning changes to the
1997 EU Directive on privacy in telecommunications that would require phone
companies, mobile network operators and ISPs to store details of their
customers' Web use, e-mails and phone calls for between one to two years.
Current law states that traffic data may be retained for billing purposes
only and then must be deleted. "EU governments claimed that changes to 1997
EC Directive on privacy in telecommunications to allow for data retention
and access by the law enforcement agencies would not be binding on member
states -- each national parliament would have to decide. Now we know that
all along they were intending to make it binding, compulsory across
Europe," says Tony Bunyan, editor of Statewatch. The changes may include
the provision that police would need a judicial order before accessing
traffic data, but Statewatch warns that such conditions have been
sidestepped before. (CNet News.com 20 Aug 2002)

THE EVER-EVOLVING LAPTOP
Laptop computers are making significant inroads in the computer market,
with notebook growth pegged at 6% in the second quarter, despite a decline
in overall sales. And while desktop machines are not likely to change much
in style over the next few years, the laptop of the future will be smaller,
lighter, and may even run on methane. PolyFuel, a spinoff of SRI
International, is developing fuel cells that break down methane molecules
into protons, electrons and carbon dioxide. While the protons pass through
a special membrane, the electrons are maneuvered into a wire that powers
the laptop. The replacement fuel cartridges initially will last two to
three times longer than conventional batteries but eventually will last 10
times longer. Other companies are seeking to expand battery life by
supplementing them with supercapacitators, which store energy at the chip
level. "Supercapacitators hold more electricity than capacitators and
transfer and recharge faster than batteries," says Anthony Kongats, CEO of
supercapacitator startup Cap-XX. Batteries can be completely removed and
the notebook will continue to run for about five minutes.
Supercapacitator-enhanced notebooks could begin hitting the shelves in 2004
and notebooks powered by fuel cells could be available by late 2004 to
2005. Other likely laptop improvements include wireless capability that can
switch effortlessly between WiFi and cellular networks, as well as
low-power screens and new types of heat-dissipation techniques.

A study funded by the Pew Internet and American Life Projects has found
that students are increasingly comfortable with the World Wide Web, and
frustrated that more of their classroom work isn't built around it. The
schools, we're not all that well prepared to use it. The kids really do
know how to use the Internet and they want it to be exploited in the ways
they know it can be exploited. Outside the classroom and outside of any
formal instruction, the Internet is a key part of their educational
instruction." (Washington Post 15 Aug 2002)

number of people who rely completely on a wireless phone will rise from the
current 3% of the population to somewhere between 5% and 10% in the next

Headlines From Edupage:

STUDENTS, FACULTY UPSET AT NEW COURSE REQUIREMENT
The Canadian subsidiary of Microsoft this week launched the Microsoft
Canada Academic Innovation Alliance to support technology research at
Canadian universities. Its first grant, however, has some students and
faculty upset about apparent influence from Microsoft. The $2.3 million
grant went to the University of Waterloo, which agreed to institute a
new class on Microsoft's C# programming language and make the course a
requirement for entering students in the electrical and computer
engineering departments. Many at the university, including the
Federation of Students, object to what they perceive as Microsoft's
buying influence. The vice president of education for the Federation of
Students said it "sets a dangerous precedent." One graduate of the
university said it shows that the administration "will do just about
anything for money."

ELECTRONIC GRE DRAWS HEAVY CRITICISM
Despite predictions that migrating from pencil-and-paper testing to
computer-based tests would result in more efficiency and convenience,
evidence of significantly increased cheating has prompted officials to
return to a pencil-and-paper version of the GRE in some countries. An
investigation discovered Web sites in China, Taiwan, and Korea that
posted answers to GRE questions. Officials from the GRE Board and the
Educational Testing Service (ETS) said that for now, the only way to
administer the test in these countries with adequate expectations for
security is with pencil and paper. Critics of computer-based testing
said this is simply the latest in a series of problems that have
plagued the system since computer testing began. Officials from GRE and
ETS remain committed to electronic testing, though, saying that its
promise can be realized when the bugs are worked out.

[What Did I Say About More and More Becoming Pay-Per-View?]
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO SHUT DOWN PUBSCIENCE
The U.S. Department of Energy runs a Web site called PubScience that
allows users to simultaneously search more than 1,000 scientific
journals for abstracts and citations. But the department wants to close
the Web site, saying that two commercial operations, Scirus and
Infotrieve, offer almost the same services. A notice at the PubScience
site (http://pubsci.osti.gov/) says that 90 percent of PubScience's
content is covered by these other sites and that their offerings are
expected to increase. A 30-day public comment period will end on
September 30, after which a final decision will be made on the future
of PubScience. Publishers of some small scientific journals argue that
closing the government-run site would be a bad idea because their
journals are not covered by either Scirus or Infotrieve.
