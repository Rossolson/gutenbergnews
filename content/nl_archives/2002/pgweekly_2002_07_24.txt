DO YOU LIVE NEAR A MAJOR LIBRARY?

We frequently need to seek physical books to determine their
copyright status and compare them to eBooks we have received.
Usually such books are in English or German, but they are sometimes
in other languages as well (you don't need to know the language,
just compare the book to the eBook).

If you are able to visit a major research library to check out books
(or photograph, photocopy or scan the title & verso pages in the
library), please email hart@pobox.com and gbnewby@ils.unc.edu

We have found that research universities, very large public libraries
(such as San Francisco and Chicago) and the Library of Congress work
best for our needs.  Smaller college and public libraries often don't
have the pre-1923 printed books we need.  So, if you live near such a
library, and can visit one occasionally to perform copyright research,
please do get in touch.

Please join our Research Team by replying to:

Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

Thanks!!!

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world, and http://promo.net/pg can
get you to the nearest one.

These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

(This number includes the 83 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)


In the first 29 weeks of the new year, we have produced 1,319 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,611 eTexts online as of July 24th, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.78 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.75 when we had 3642 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.94 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???


At 5611 eBooks in 31 Years We Averaged
  180 Per Year

At 1319 eBooks Done In 2002 We Averaged
  200 eBooks Per Month!!!


***Headline News***
[My Comments In Brackets]

Headlines From Newsscan

CHINA IS NO. 3 IN INTERNET USERS
Exceptionally strong growth in Internet use over the past year has vaulted
China to the No. 3 position in the world in terms of online population
numbers. A 72% increase since last year translates to 45 million Chinese
citizens now logging on regularly, even as the government still struggles
with how to control subversive content. Only the U.S. and Japan have more
citizens online, according to a report from the China Internet Network
Information Center, an industry group funded by the Information Industry
Ministry. The average Chinese user spends eight hours and 20 minutes online
each week, and while Internet formerly was concentrated among academics,
68% of current users do not have college degrees. "The Internet is now
coming closer to common people," says the People's Daily newspaper.
(AP 23 Jul 2002)  http://apnews.excite.com/article/20020723/D7KUIAUG1.html

[An earlier story had China at #2, back when they had 33 million users,
I'll try to do some more research, it's probably pretty close to Japan.]


FIND A BOOK, MAKE A FRIEND
An online phenomenon called bookcrossing is making new friends among book
lovers. The idea is that once you're finished with a good book, you leave
it in some likely public place, like a grocery store or laundromat, along
with information on how to log onto the bookcrossing.com Web site to let
you know how the finder liked it. The Web site, which claims 18,000
members, says more than 42,000 books have been "released into the wild" in
45 countries over the past year. Only about 10% to 15% of the books people
release are "successful," meaning they're picked up by people who log onto
the site, says BookCrossing's founder Ron Hornbaker. "It's sort of like
fishing. If you caught a fish every castoff of the line, it would get
boring. Even the ones you don't hear from, you have to keep the faith that
maybe they found a good home. It's better than sitting on a bookshelf." The
concept has sparked a new posse of book hunters, who haunt coffee shops,
parks and museums looking for "released" books, and an equally enthusiastic
group of book releasers, who work to come up with imaginative places to
leave their treasures (i.e., "The Name of the Rose" in a floral shop or
"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" in a Nordstrom's dressing room).
"The whole thing is designed to take you on an adventure," says one
participant."  (Los Angeles Times 23 Jul 2002)

REALNETWORKS EMBRACES OPEN-SOURCE PHILOSOPHY
In an strategy to recover market share from Microsoft, RealNetworks will
release for open-source development its new code for delivering
("streaming") audio and video over the Internet. The company invented
streaming media eight years ago with the Real Audio player, but has been
losing market share to Microsoft, which integrates its own Media Player
integrated into the Microsoft's Windows operating system. Called Helix, the
new software will be offered as "open source" code, allowing companies like
Sun, Lindows and PalmSource to create applications for the new platform,
and setting the stage for an extension of that platform to the next
generation of smart phones, personal digital assistants, and other
intelligent devices. (San Jose Mercury News 22 Jul 2002)

[Automating "Nice People". . .?"]
PLEASANT VOICES ARE A HOT COMMODITY
The proliferation of speech-automated systems to handle routine tasks in
financial services, airline companies, and other businesses is generating a
demand for voice actors, who nowadays include telephone greetings and
message prompts in their demo tapes. Companies increasingly are looking for
a friendly, conversational approach to automated systems that represent the
front line of customer relations, and are striving to find just the right
tone. After months of market research, Wells Fargo's credit card division
opted on a young, hip but serious voice that sounds something like a
30-something male banker. "We thought our customers might like some fun in
the system, but they told us, 'No.' They just wanted someone professional,"
says division head Tom LaCentra. According to research by Datamonitor, at
least 25% of Fortune 500 companies invested in voice-automated systems in
2001, up from 12% in 2000, and the voice technology market is predicted to
rise to nearly $3 billion by 2007. (AP/CNN.com 18 Jul 2002)

"Wow," said Stanford University law professor Deborah Hensler when told that
competing lawyers are now competing not just in the courtroom but on eBay
auctions -- to obtain evidence useful for trial. Personal injury cases
involving the need for collectible-quality artifacts (such as 30-year-old
asbestos product manuals or 1950s-era advertisements glorifying cigarettes)
are especially sought-after now in eBay auctions. After Professor Hensler
litigation." And personal injury lawyer Al Brayton  sums it up like this:
"Today, you get not only the plaintiffs' bar bidding, but you have the
defense bar bidding. The prices have gone up a lot in the last year. A lot."

The New York Times was a very harsh critic of Enron's accounting
manipulations, and yet the Times company itself had no qualms about
striking a "newsprint swap agreement" with Enron that involved absolutely
no exchange of physical assets and was disclosed only in the small print of
SEC filings. As for the Washington Post, its editorial pages came out
swinging against rules that "made a mockery of corporate accounting" by
allowing companies to grant employee stock options "without recording a
dime of expenses" -- yet The Post Co. was doing exactly the same thing at
the same time. Asked about these double standards, the Times takes the
high-minded position that its reporters were completely clueless about the
relationship more -- had our journalists even been conscious of it -- but
it's inconceivable that anyone will think our journalism was influenced by
such a development." At the Post, chairman and chief executive Donald
Graham has taken a more nuanced position, essentially maintaining that
knows, the editorial page writes what it thinks is good policy, and if it
varies with newspaper policy or corporate policy, that's fine."

[Can You Trust Any Search Engines Tomorrow?]
ASK JEEVES TEAMS UP WITH GOOGLE
Search engine Ask Jeeves says it will begin listing the ad-driven results
provided by its more popular rival, Google, in a deal expected to generate
sales of at least $100 million over the next three years. The move is
intended to stem the flow of Jeeves' red ink, with losses totaling $694
million since its inception. The move comes as a blow to Overture, which
pioneered the concept of ad-driven search results and has been supplying
them to Jeeves for the past year. Overture downplayed the loss, with CEO
Ted Meisel saying, "We are still winning more deals than we are losing and
I think we are winning the right ones." Earlier this year Google supplanted
Overture in high-profile contracts with AOL and EarthLink. "We would like
to have everyone as a customer," said Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

AOL PUFFED ITS AD REVENUES; THE POST IS SHOCKED, SHOCKED
In October of 2000, AOL's then-president Robert W. Pittman and other AOL
executives were told the company faced the risk of losing more than $140
million in ad revenue the following year, but two weeks later -- when asked
it, and I don't buy it." A new Washington Post review of AOL documents now
shows that the company made a wide variety of questionable deals and
bookkeeping adjustments to keep their ad revenue figures looking good. An
AOL executive who is no longer with the company says his former colleagues
was not of the highest quality. I don't know if they're still in denial, but
there were some pretty big business issues they were not willing to face.
For nine months, I tried to get these guys out of denial. I tried to take
the perfume off the pig."  AOL has issued a statement insisting that all
their bookkeeping adjustments and deals were completely appropriate.

Headlines From Edupage:

SENATE FINALLY UPGRADES E-MAIL APPLICATION
The U.S. Senate has begun upgrading its offices to Microsoft Outlook,
replacing its 12-year-old system. The House of Representatives began
replacing its aging e-mail system in 1996, but the Senate until now
continued to use "cc:Mail," a program developed in 1985 and in service
at the Senate office since 1990. According to Senate staffers, the old
system took at least 15 minutes to transmit a message and sometimes up
to several days. The old system also did not allow sending Web pages.
One staffer who asked not to be named said if a message needed to get
there quickly, he would use his Yahoo account. The Senate conversion is
expected to be finished by November, though some Senators have said
they don't want the upgrade until after election day, fearing problems
with the transition.

SENATE COPYRIGHT BILL MOVES THROUGH COMMITTEE
On Wednesday the House Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the
Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization (TEACH) Act. The
bill, which is identical to a Senate bill approved last year, would
expand the copyright exceptions available to schools for using
protected content in instructional activities. Under the terms of the
bill, distance educators may transmit nondramatic literary and musical
works digitally, and show selected portions of dramatic works. F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr., the chair of the Judiciary Committee, had held up
the legislation, hoping to create new protections for databases at the
same time. Under pressure to pass the TEACH Act, and in light of the
difficulty in passing a database bill, Sensenbrenner allowed the bill
to pass to the full House of Representatives.

ASK JEEVES TO GET SPONSORED LINKS FROM GOOGLE
Google has won another round in the battle of search engine
advertising. Ask Jeeves announced it will soon include paid search
results provided by Google. Overture Services, the company that
originated the idea of selling real estate on a search engine's
results pages, had been providing Ask Jeeves with paid results since
last year. According to a company spokesman, Ask Jeeves hopes to double
its revenue from paid listings in the second half of the year with the
new arrangement with Google. An official from Google said his company
"would like to have everyone as a customer."

PORTABLE CELL PHONE NUMBERS DELAYED, AGAIN
The Federal Communications Commission gave cell phone companies until
November 2003 to offer cell phone customers the choice of keeping their
cell phone numbers after switching from one wireless company to
another. This is the third extension granted by the FCC. Most wireless
companies oppose the concept because of cost. Verizon Wireless,
Cingular Wireless, Sprint PCS, and AT&T Wireless oppose the portable
number requirement, while others, such as Nextel Communications and
Leap Wireless, support the option as a way to gain customers.

WEBCASTING ROYALTIES CHALLENGED IN APPEALS COURT
A group of radio stations filed a motion before a federal appeals court
to set aside the rule that they must pay musicians and recording
companies when they stream songs over the Internet. Their argument
relies on the historical practice of not paying royalties for regular
broadcasts. The motion is in response to a 0.07 cent per listener per
song rate for Internet radio established by the Copyright Office in
June. Webcasters did not participate in the appeal of the August 2001
decision. The appeal was filed by the National Association of
Broadcasters along with radio companies Bonneville International, Clear
Channel Communications, Cox Radio, Emmis Communications, Entercom
Communications, and Susquehanna Radio.

[What did I say about "per-per-everything?]
APPLE TO START CHARGING FOR WEB SERVICES
In a move reminiscent of Microsoft's .NET strategy, Apple Computer
will begin charging for its iTools Web services, which will be renamed
".Mac." The service will cost $99.95 per year; users of iTools who sign
up for the new service by September 30 will get an introductory rate of
$49.95 for the first year. Apple CEO Steve Jobs said at the Macworld
show in New York that the "world is changing" and Apple needs to
reflect that change. Apple will reportedly increase the storage
capacity for users and add anti-virus software and Web-based e-mail.
Reaction from iTools users was generally positive. Some said they would
definitely pay for the service, while others said the charge would be
reasonable if the improvements to the service are made.
