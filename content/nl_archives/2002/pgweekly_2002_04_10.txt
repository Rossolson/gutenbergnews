     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 04/10/02**:  5,031
(This number includes the 60 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 14 weeks of the new year, we have produced 739 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1996 to produce our *FIRST* 739 eBooks!!!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 5,031 eTexts online as of April 10, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.99 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.97 when we had 3371 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.98 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

[First, some strange things on the Intellectual Property Front]

AUTHORS UNHAPPY ABOUT AMAZON USED-BOOK SALES
The Authors Guild, a trade group for writers, is asking its 82,000 members
to protest Amazon.com's "notorious used-book service," which provides
Amazon with about 15% of total revenue but pays nothing to writers or
publishers. An Amazon executive says of the used-book program (where Amazon
members sell the books directly to each other), "We think this is something
that is great for the customers, and it is good for the authors, too,
because it encourages customers to try authors and genres they may not have
tried." Authors feel that their new books are competing against themselves,
when lower-priced used copies are listed on the same Web page that features
new copies of the same book. (New York Times 10 Apr 2002)

WIN-WIN DIGITAL MEDIA STRATEGY: LOWER THE PRICE
Marc Andreessen, the programmer who co-founded Netscape, told an audience
of broadcasting and recording industry executives that it was futile for
them to hope that copy protection technology would prevent illegal copying
of music, movies or TV shows. "If a computer can see it, display it, and
play it -- you can copy it." Do what did he advise them to do? Produce more
copies and lower the price, which is the strategy that worked for the PC
software industry. Adoption of the same strategy for digital media will
yield the same results: a sales bonanza. Andreessen told the executives:
"My prediction is that is exactly what's going to happen in the
entertainment industry. Digital media is the biggest opportunity the
entertainment industry has ever seen." (San Jose Mercury News 9 Apr 2002)

CAN FALWELL'S NAME BE TRADEMARKED TO PROTECT HIM AGAINST PARODY?
The Reverend Jerry Falwell has lodged a complaint with the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) charging that a Web site that
parodies him is violating his "common-law" trademark of his name. The
operator of the parody Web site says Falwell's name is not entitled to
trademark protection because he hasn't used it for the purpose of
identifying goods and services. WIPO is headquartered in Geneva,
Switzerland. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 4 Apr 2002)

DISTRIBUTED BRAINPOWER TARGETS WORLD WIDE LEXICON
In a new twist on distributed computing, software designer Brian McConnell
is releasing a new software program that would harness the unused
brainpower of the world's computer users to build a multilingual
translation database. Unlike many other distributed computing projects,
which use the extra processing capacity of PCs, this one would require
participants to provide short translations when able. "It's a clever twist
on distributed computing," says McConnell. "In this case the computers are
people's brains." The World Wide Lexicon (WWL) project will need
multilingual volunteers to download the software, which can detect when
they're not particularly busy and ask them to translate a word or a phrase.
Some language experts have expressed reservations about the whole idea:
"One of the main problems is quality assurance," says a linguistics expert
at the University of Wolverhampton in the U.K. "Translation is a highly
developed skill." McConnell says he hopes to incorporate a peer review
component to ensure the translations are accurate. (New Scientist 2 Apr 2002)

Headlines From Edupage

MICROSOFT REFOCUSES ON SECURITY
In February Microsoft began an initiative to make security its
toppriority, above adding new features. After a spate of concerns
raised about security holes in its operating systems and other
software, the company sent 9,000 of its top developers to training
on writing secure software. Programmers were also instructed to
search through existing code for flaws that could compromise
security. Microsoft admitted that its goal of making software easy
to use is often at odds with making it safe from attack, including
two especially destructive viruses last year, Code Red and Nimbda.
The company said it has shifted its attention from features to
security, though many skeptics have adopted a wait-and-see
attitude.
