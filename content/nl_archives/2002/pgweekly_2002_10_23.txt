CIA FACT BOOK READY FOR FORMATTING  [Second Request]

The 2002 edition of the CIA World Fact Book is now
available at http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html
Project Gutenberg needs a volunteer to harvest and reformat
this work into plain text (HTML is optional).  See our previous
WFB's for formatting idea.  Interested?  Email gbnewby@ils.unc.edu

***

Second Request for Alice

If we could get a volunteer to scan them in a similarly large size
to the other Alice illustrations, then I could have a go at producing
an illustrated version of "Through the Looking Glass".
[This would require scanning about 50 illustrations]

***

David R. <mr_der@hotmail.com> is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Third Request!

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

PROJECT GUTENBERG GIVES A MILLION eBOOKS AT FOOTBALL GAME

Last Friday, Project Gutenberg, the oldest Internet site,
famous for handing out millions of eBook via the Internet,
gave away a million eBooks on CDROM's to the fans at the
big game last Friday.

Several volunteers, including Project Gutenberg founder,
and Stockholm Prize winner Michael S. Hart, braved truly
monsoon conditions in which the game was delayed several
times due to the weather.

Jim Sheppard, the Memorial Stadium voice of the Fighting
Illini football team, announced that the volunteers were
in the stands to hand out the million eBooks on CDROMs,
and that anyone interested should flag down a volunteer.
All million eBooks were snatched up in a matter of minutes,
so preparations are already in the works to provide from
two million to ten million next year, if all goes well.

Project Gutenberg wishes to thank Alec Anderson, Athletic
Director of Urbana High School, and Jim Sheppard for their
wonderful assistance in helping bring this about, along with
Charles Aldarondo, Paul Christensen, and Stephanie Cosat,
who braved the weather to hand out the million eBooks.
And many thanks to Steve Maniscalco, Daniel Callahan,
Joe Maina, William Fishburne, Aaron Cannon, Matt Ellsworth,
Richard Fane, Norm Wolcott, Wayne Hamilton, Mark Zinzow and
Greg Newby who helped make up the CDROM image and disks.

The Stockholm Prizes are announced at the same time and in
the same location as the Nobel Prizes, but organizations
are not eligible for the Nobel Prizes.  Project Gutenberg
was awarded the prize earlier this month in Stockholm, on
October 10th.  The physical prize is now in transit, and
will be on display in the office of Prof. Greg Newby, the
Project Gutenberg CEO, at the Univeristy of North Carolina.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the first 41 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,853 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,185 eTexts online as of October 2, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.62 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.50 when we had 4006 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.86 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

MAN VS. MACHINE CONTEST ENDS IN A DRAW
The eight-game chess series billed as the "Brains in Bahrain" has ended in
a draw, with world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik and his supercomputer
opponent Deep Fritz each winning two games and drawing the other four. The
German company ChessBase created Fritz, which is capable of evaluating 3.5
million moves in a second. (Reuters 20 Oct 2002)

POP-UP SPAM -- A DIABOLICAL INVENTION
As if e-mail spam weren't annoying enough -- now there's pop-up spam. A
Romanian-based company has developed software that can blast computers with
pop-up messages through the Messenger function on many Windows operating
systems that was originally designed to allow computer network technicians
to warn network users of a planned shutdown (not to be confused with
Instant Messenger). Gary Flynn, a security engineer at James Madison
like somebody barging into your office and interrupting you." Zoltan
Kovacs, founder of the company that makes the software, responds, "If some
people use it for bad things, they should take their own responsibility,
but it's their own problem." The new spam technique represents the latest
attempt by advertisers to bypass the increasingly sophisticated e-mail
filters used by ISPs and individuals, and also circumvents state and other
laws designed to curb junk e-mail. (AP 20 Oct 2002)

ENDING MARKETING CALLS TO CELL PHONES
To help telemarketers comply with a 1991 federal law banning auto-dialed or
prerecorded commercial calls to cell phones, the Direct Marketing
Association has identified 280 million existing and prospective wireless
numbers for its member businesses to avoid calling. Member companies have
been afraid they'll get into trouble for inadvertently calling cell phone
numbers not readily distinguishable cellular from landline numbers.

CRITICS SAY ADS ON CNN.COM LOOK A LOT LIKE NEWS
CNN.com has started running ads that look a lot like editorial links,
raising concern among some journalism ethics watchdogs. The ads, which
feature text like "If You Love Coffee" or "Avoid Bad Retailers," run
adjacent to news headlines and are not clearly labeled as having been
sponsored, or paid for by advertisers. "Clearly, CNN.com needs to mark this
'adv' or 'advertisement' in that gray space, because it looks too similar
to the rest of (the news site)," says Sreenath Sreenivasan, who runs the
new media journalism program at Columbia University Graduate School of
Journalism. A CNN.com spokesman said the advertising links were new, and
that previously the space had promoted internal stories or content from
other Time Warner publications. He added that the company plans in the next
few days to clearly label the links as "sponsored." CNN.com's foray into
text-only advertising links reflects a general willingness among Web
publishers to experiment with all kinds of advertising in an effort to
combat the challenges of a grim economy. "Online news companies generally
tend to be much more adventurous with new forms of advertising, including
pop-up ads and things like moving screens. But everyone is trying to make
money, and this is a constant process of evolution of editorial standards
online," says Sreenivasan. (CNet News.com 16 Oct 2002)

NOAA EXPANDS 'PERSONAL LOCATOR BEACON' PROGRAM
Beginning July 1, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will
extend to hikers, hunters and other land-bound recreational enthusiasts the
same emergency locator service now available to pilots and boaters. The
"personal locator beacons" -- handheld devices equipped with GPS technology
-- work in zones not covered by cell phone networks and will cost $300 or
more. "It takes the search out of search and rescue," says Randy Crosby,
who heads up rescue teams in northern Alaska, where the devices have been
tested for the past six years. In its 20 years of operation, the satellite
rescue system has helped save some 14,000 people worldwide, including about
4,300 in the U.S. There is no penalty for accidental false alarms, but
deliberate misuse can cost perpetrators up to $250,000 in fines, a six-year
prison term and reimbursement of rescue costs. NOAA spokesman Daniel
Karlson says the government works to educate beacon owners so "someone
doesn't go out there and stub their toe and trip this thing off. We want
this as a last resort. (AP 16 Oct 2002)

COUCH POTATOES GIVE THUMBS UP TO TEXT MESSAGING
TV viewers in Europe increasingly are reaching for their mobile phones
rather than their PCs to interact with their favorite "reality" shows, in
which viewers' votes determine the outcomes. Most reality shows allow
text-message voting, and in some cases the majority of votes are now cast
in this way. In addition, news shows encourage viewers to send in comments,
game shows allow viewers to compete, and music shows take requests via
text-message. The trend toward TV text messaging has been a boon for
wireless operators' bottom lines, and many shows are beginning to view the
additional revenues as a vital component of their business models (revenues
are typically shared, with 40% to 50% going to the operator and the
remainder split between the broadcaster, the production studio and the
message processing company). For instance, the most recent British series
of "Big Brother" generated 5.4 million text-message votes and $2.1 million
in revenue. Endemol, the Dutch company that produces "Big Brother," has
already started compiling its own database of mobile phone users, and
analysts say its next step will be to establish direct billing
relationships with them, attempting to bypass the operators. Operators are
responding with a more open attitude toward revenue-sharing, with France's
Orange even going so far as to publish a rate card for divvying up the
proceeds -- a degree of cooperation that once would have been unthinkable.
Meanwhile, all this messaging is subtly changing the nature of television,
notes text-message infrastructure provider CMG. Rather than presenting
predetermined content to viewers, an increasing number of programs are
based on response to viewers' input. (The Economist 17 Oct 2002)

SHARP UNVEILS NEXT-GENERATION DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY
Japan's Sharp Corporation took the wraps off its latest advance in flat
display technology -- a screen that features the microprocessor circuitry
applied directly onto the glass, using the company's continuous grain
silicon (CGS) technology. Sharp says the new technique will save space, cut
production costs and produce ultra-fine resolutions for displaying maps or
photos. Sharp's foray into next-generation display technology comes as
South Korean and Taiwanese continue to nip at its heels, moving
aggressively into the LCD market. Sharp is hoping the new CGS screen not
only will enable it keep it its Asian competitors at bay, but also will
enable it to stay one step ahead of the rival low-temperature polysilicon
technology used in screens by Toshiba and Sanyo Electronic. Sharp's Mikio
Katayama, head of the company's mobile display division, says CGS, with its
greater uniformity of silicon grains, achieved three times the rate of
electron transfer as low-temperature silicon, making it the superior
technology for on-screen circuitry. (Reuters 22 Oct 2002)

Headlines From Edupage:

AOL SAYS IT WILL END SOME POP-UP ADS
America Online said that in an effort to strengthen its position in the
market it would eliminate many pop-up ads, generally disliked by users.
Some other online services have made similar decisions, including
iVillage and EarthLink. An official from Microsoft promised that their
service would always have fewer pop-ups than AOL. Jon Miller of AOL
said the decision reflected an acknowledgment that pop-up ads annoy
users and do not represent a viable or substantial strategy for
advertising revenue. AOL will refocus on other forms of advertising and
on building support from customers. AOL is facing new pressure for
customers from Microsoft's MSN service.
