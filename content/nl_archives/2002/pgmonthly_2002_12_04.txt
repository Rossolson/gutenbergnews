                  "They Said It Couldn't Be Done!"

When Project Gutenberg completed eBook #100, The Complete Shakespeare,
on December 10th, 1993, all the pundits said we couldn't possibly keep
pace with Moore's Law, doubling every 18 months!  In fact, they said
not even huge concerns such as Intel CPUs could keep up, but specifically
that Project Gutenberg, an any other human based work enterprise,
could not possibly keep up with Moore's law.

                  Today We Have Proven Them Wrong!

Here are the Moore's Law predictions from Dec. 10, 1993 to Dec. 10, 2002:

9 years, doubling once ever 18 months would be a total of 6 doublings:

Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. <mr_der@hotmail.com> is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Third Request!

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

From: Miranda van de Heijning <m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com>
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

***

Planetary scanning help needed in Yorkshire, England for fragile 19th
century books of A'bp Whately     Please contact:  david@whateley.org
We need a non-destructive method of scanning this delicate material.]

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the first 48 weeks of this year, we have produced 2,187 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our *FIRST* 2,187 eBooks!!!

             That's 48 WEEKS as Compared to 29 YEARS!!!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,479 eBooks online as of December 4, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.54 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.40 when we had 4161 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.81 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 6479 eBooks in 31 1/3 Years We Averaged
    200 Per Year   [This is how many we do per month these days!]
     17 Per Month
     .5 Per Day

At 2187 eBooks Done In 2002 We Averaged
      7 eBooks Per Day
     48 eBooks Per Week
    199 eBooks Per Month !!!
