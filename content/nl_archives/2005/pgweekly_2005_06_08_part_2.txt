.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.
 
The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at
 
  http://gutenberg.org/find
 
which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.
 
Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:
 
  http://gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL
 
If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:
 
  http://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL
 
That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.
 
And to directly access the file directories:
 
  http://gutenberg.org/dirs/
 
Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.
