[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 15,822 eBooks online as of March 23, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.99 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,261,863 x 15,822 x $.98 = $1 trillion


With 15,822 eBooks online as of March 23, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.63 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.83 when we had 11,912 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 15,822 eBooks in 33 Years and 08.75 Months We Averaged
      ~469 Per Year
        39.0 Per Month
         1.28 Per Day

At 866 eBooks Done In The 77 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      11.25 Per Day
      79 Per Week
     315 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


FRANCE CALLS GOOGLE'S ANTE
High-level officials in France have put their support behind an
initiative to digitize European works of literature and make them
available free online. President Jacques Chirac, as well as Jean-Noel
Jeanneney, president of the National Library of France, and Renaud
Donnedieu de Vabres, minister of culture and communication, met
recently to discuss efforts to digitize the "cultural patrimony" of
France and Europe, a discussion evidently prompted by recently
announced plans by Google to digitize vast amounts of English-language
literature. Following the meeting, Donnedieu de Vabres published an
essay called "Google Is Not the End of History," in which he commented
that "we probably have a lot to learn from Google" and said the Google
announcement "comes in an intellectual and cultural climate in which
the digitization of documents and works seems to be the key to all
problems." French officials rejected the notion that their actions are
merely a reaction to Google or that their project should be seen as
antithetical to or in competition with Google.

CHINA BLOCKS ACCESS TO CAMPUS WEB PAGES
Chinese officials have blocked outside access to a number of online
bulletin boards operated by universities. Such bulletin boards have
become popular vehicles for discussion about topics including politics,
pop culture, and pornography, subjects which Chinese authorities have
not been shy about censoring. Tsinghua University's Shuimu Tsinghua
bulletin board was one of those restricted recently, joining bulletin
boards at Wuhan University and Nankai University, as well as one at
Peking University that was shut down entirely. According to a student
from Tsinghua University who asked not to be named, the Ministry of
Education's reasoning for blocking outside access was "because the
bulletin board was only supposed to be a platform for internal exchange
within the university." He added, "Students are calm about it, but it seems
that non-student users are angry because they can no longer get access."

APPLYING OLD SCAMS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES
The emergence of voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) phone service has
opened a new door for hackers and others to fool users. Using the
Internet to transmit phone calls allows callers to spoof Caller ID
systems, something that isn't possible with traditional phone service.
Although telemarketers are required by the Federal Communications
Commission to properly identify themselves, Caller ID spoofing is
otherwise not prohibited. As a result, someone can, for example, call
Western Union, which requires customers to call from their home phones
to initiate money transfers, using a faked source number, and make a
fraudulent transfer. In other instances, debt collectors and private
investigators use Caller ID spoofing to trick people into answering
their phones and possibly divulging information they otherwise would
not. Scams similar to e-mail phishing rackets also take advantage of
Caller ID spoofing, deceiving people into believing that a caller is at
a bank or a financial institution and helping persuade them to reveal
personal information to the caller.

REPORT OFFERS RENEWED CRITICISM FOR E-RATE PROGRAM
A new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) puts forth
renewed charges of fraud and mismanagement in the federal government's
E-rate Program, designed to subsidize technology to connect U.S.
schools and libraries to the Internet. The report was prepared for the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is conducting its own
investigation. Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the committee,
blamed the Federal Communications Commission, unscrupulous vendors, and
certain schools for the problems in the program, which he said was a
"disgrace." Although investigations have led to a handful of penalties
for abuse in the program, the report advises increased efforts to clean
it up. Among the report's recommendations are calls to
"comprehensively determine which federal accountability requirements
apply to E-rate; establish meaningful E-rate performance goals and
measures; and take steps to reduce its backlog of appeals."

U.S. CONSIDERS RESTRICTIONS ON SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS

[Did you know that your Social Security Numbers is supposed to be
used ONLY for Social Security purposes?  You have a right to refuse
to give it to anyone else who asks for it.  I called the Social
Security Administration to verify this.]

Following recent incidents that exposed personal information on more
than 175,000 individuals, U.S. lawmakers are considering placing new
restrictions on companies that gather and sell such information.
Relatively few regulations apply to companies such as ChoicePoint and
LexisNexis that collect data about driving records, financial records,
and other sensitive information. Social Security numbers appear to be
at the crux of the issue: because they are unique, data companies rely
on Social Security numbers to distinguish individuals, but the numbers
are also a powerful weapon in the hands of identity thieves, who can
use them to access confidential records, open new accounts, and wreak
havoc with a person's privacy. At separate hearings in the House and
the Senate, legislators discussed laws that would require data
companies to notify any individual before they sell that person's
Social Security number. Other suggestions included requiring disclosure
of any incident that exposes sensitive information. Don McGuffey, vice
president of ChoicePoint, which recently sold 145,000 records to
identity thieves, told a Senate hearing that personal information had
been compromised by his company in "a handful" of other incidents that
were not made public.

MICROSOFT AND STUDENT SETTLE OVER SOFTWARE RESALE
Microsoft and David Zamos have reached a settlement in their dispute
over Zamos's sale on eBay of Microsoft software he purchased while a
student at the University of Akron. After Zamos bought Windows XP Pro
and Microsoft Office from the university bookstore, he found he was not
permitted to return it, though it was unopened. Zamos, who paid about
$50 for both products because of deep educational discounts, decided to
sell the software on eBay, where he sold each for about $100. The sale
prompted Microsoft to file a lawsuit alleging that Zamos improperly
benefited from academic pricing, in violation of company policies.
Zamos argued that such policies were not explained on the packaging,
and he countersued the company, alleging that because of Microsoft's
actions and policies, obtaining a refund for software is virtually
impossible. Although both parties expressed their satisfaction with the
resolution, a confidentiality agreement covering the settlement
prevents disclosure of any details. A statement from Microsoft did
note, however, that the company will "continue its commitment to
protecting those intended to benefit from its academic program,"
suggesting it will continue to look unfavorably on anyone reselling
academic purchases.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


No Weapons Of Mass Destruction


It turns out that the US used technologies in Iraq that
could have even detected a penny that had been stored in
proximity to an atomic bomb or chemical warfare elements.

Such a penny could easily be detected in a huge stack of
otherwise identical pennies.

A person who recently received anti-cancer radiation therapy
set of the alarms in the Holland Tunnel when returning to
New York from New Jersey.

*

Iraq still has no president and no prime minister.

*

The Ukraine shipped nuclear-capable missiles to Iran and
to China.  These put Turkey and Israel in Iran's range.

*

New Alaskan oil could barely reach the pump in 10 years.

*

The Vatican vehemently and repeatedly denies that Jesus
could have been married, yet no reference is made to an
assortment of evidence that Jesus was a rabbi, and then
to the fact that rabbis must be married.

This issue recently resurfaced in relation to Da Vinci
Code plot elements that Jesus was married.

The Vatican has requested The Da Vinci Code be deleted
from Christian bookstores, but apparently this isn't a
big issue with the booksellers who ignored the order.

The Da Vinci Code has sold 25 million copies.

*

$9 billion dollars the US sent to Iraq is missing.



*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK


Radio Frequency ID Tags


Speaking about RFID tags for his kids, Harry Hamlin said:

"I can't wait until the chips are ready," referring to the
implantable GPS ID tags that are already in use in animals.

He wants to know where his kids are every minute every day.

[This is a miniaturized internal version of what is on the
ankle bracelet Martha Stewart is wearing the next 5 months]

"Disarming Iraq and The War On Terror are not related."

Don Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz just 50 days before
"Shock And Awe."

Paul Wolfowitz is the heir apparent to lead the World Bank,
which is nearly always headed by someone from the U.S., but
there is some concern about a resume as the major architect
of the Iraq invasion be accepted as a World Banker resume.


DOUBLESPEAK OF THE DAY

The Doublespeak Committee awarded the 1989 Doublespeak Award to:

EXXON

"For calling some 35 miles of Alaskan beaches `environmentally clean'
and "environmentally stabilized."  In his announcement speech,
Doublespeak Committee Chair William Lutz noted that various major
news media subsequently reported the visible presence of oil along
the coast in the area where the supertanker Exxon Valdez ran aground
March 24, 1989. . .just about exactly 16 years ago.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

RFIDs will be transferred from keeping track of animals in
the wild and in agriculture to keeping track of people.

Entire schools will inist on the "electronic hall passes."

Big Brother won't have to watch you, he will know where you
are at all times. . ."The Computer Never Blinks."


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


The United States Military Academies Report Hundreds Of Sex
Oriented Assaults On Their Female Cadets By The Male Cadets
Every Year.  [West Point, Annapolis, and Air Force Academy]

*

6,000 Coal miners are officially reported killed every year as
China goes ballistic in its effort to keep energy supplies up.
Unofficial reports say the figure 2 to 3 times as high.

*

60% of Afganistan's GDP is opium poppies.  For each dollar in
poppy acreage a farmer would only receive 8.3 cents in wheat.

*

According to "Testosterone Dreams" more police officers in
are using drugs than athletes.

*

Anti-depressants are the 3rd most prescribed drugs in the US
and have many of the same ingredients that are railed against
in public announcements.

Prediction:  we will find we have millions addicted to them.

*

90% of the prisoners at the US base at Guantanamo, Cuba are
there for unspecified reasons.

*

1/2 the population of Tehran, Iran is under 20 years old.
Tehran is the capital of Iran.

*


Gas prices would be $3 if they had kept up with the rising
prices of everything else.

*

For those who keep up with such things, the US Trade Deficit
reached 2/3 of a trillion dollars last year, and this figure
must be subtracted from the GDP to equal the GNP.

The Gross Domestic Product was created to make things look a
bit better by not subtracting our debt from our profits, as
was done with GNP figures.

Thus all current GDP figures are 2/3 of a trillion too high.

Of course, the National Debt is much higher.

*

In an interesting coincidence, chess champion Bobby Fischer
was granted citizenship by Iceland after years of searching
for a home where he could just be left alone, the same day
Gary Kasparov, the last great champion, retired.  Was Gary's
retirement a gambit to unpin his fianchettoed knight?

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
