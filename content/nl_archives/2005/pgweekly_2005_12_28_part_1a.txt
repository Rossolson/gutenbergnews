REQUEST FOR BOOKS!!!

Several of our long time volunteers are having trouble
locating copies of the following books.  Before you do
too much to acquire them, you might want to check from
your own local copyright law about scanning them, as I
presume some of these may not fit into a public domain
status in all countries, but all should be ok in "life
+50" countries, and some perhaps even more widely.

Contact cjc@gutenberg.net.au if further information is required.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

JAPAN EXPLORES SEARCH ENGINE DEVELOPMENT
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry has organized a
study group of universities and electronics companies, including
Hitachi and Panasonic, to consider the merits of creating a search
engine specifically for Japan's Web users. Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi has publicly stated that Japan needs to extend its
influence in the IT arena. The government reportedly is considering
spending up to $885 million on the search-engine plan as part of its
efforts to become more dominant online.

PATENT OFFICE EXPECTED TO REJECT NTP PATENTS
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office notified NTP, a patent holding
company, and Research in Motion (RIM), maker of the BlackBerry wireless
e-mail device, that it expects to reject the five patents held by NTP.
The two companies are involved in a patent infringement lawsuit brought
by NTP. The patent office had issued preliminary rejections of the
e-mail patents in the past, but speeded its review process in response
to a request by RIM. The patent review is separate from the patent
infringement lawsuit, which could potentially stop most BlackBerry
service in the United States. NTP expects to appeal the final patent
rulings, a process that could take several years.

HACKERS HIT SECURITY COMPANY DATABASE
Hackers gained access to the financial and personal data of 3,800 law
enforcement and network security professionals when they broke into the
customer database of Guidance Software in Pasadena, California.
Guidance Software is a leading provider of software to diagnose hacker
attacks, and its EnCase product is used by hundreds of security
researchers and law enforcement agencies worldwide, including the U.S.
Secret Service and FBI. The break-in took place in November and was
discovered December 7. The company alerted its customers within two
days after the discovery and assured them it would no longer store
customer credit card data. The company is working with the Secret
Service on a detailed investigation of the incident.

INTERESTING QUOTES:

"There is no question that what this platform,
what I call the `flat world platform,'
does is really empower individuals.

"We've gone from a globalization
that was really built around countries,
to one built around companies,
to one that is increasingly empowering individuals."

News From Other Sources

Reports surfaced today that Harry Pooter and the
Pyramid of Furmat will be the 7th and final book
in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.  However,
similar reports indicated the title of The Half
Blood Prince would be Harry Potter and the Pillar
of Storge.

"The Pyramids of Furmat lie a few miles east of the famous
Fortress of Shadows, not far from the magnificent Pillar of Storge."
According to Ms. Rowling.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

Vice President Cheney removed his residence from online
sources, says The New York Times, December 28, 2005.
Google then replaced the tampered government photographs
with others from a more reliable/valid private source.

See Maureen Dowd's column.

*

Delphi auto parts has finally withdrawn from the table
a proposal to cut workers' wages to 33%, not *by* 33%,
in the face of asking for hundreds of millions to pay
600 executives it wants to keep as it files bankruptcy,
the same 600 executives who led them into bankruptcy.
If changes at Delphi do not run smoothly, General Motors
could also face insolvency.

ABC News
Automotive News
Detroit Free Press

At least there was some mention of the over 200,000 deaths
due to the tsunami in some of the "year in review" stories.

*

No mention of Valerie Plame, whose husband, Ambassador
Joseph Wilson, warned before the Iraq war that the WMD
[Weapons of Mass Destruction] cited by President Bush
and others did not exist.  Ms. Plame was then "outed"
as a CIA agent, presumably in response.  [No mention
even in the Top 100 stories of the year.]

*

The "eminent domain" strategies of moving people out
of their neighborhoods to move in big businesses who
would pay more taxes got no mention either.  However,
at least one story mentioned that most Seaside, MS.
homes were over $1 million, and that once offshore
floating casinos will now be rebuilt on land, land
once owned by the poor who lived there for a number
of generations, who will never get to rebuild.

Apparently residents there are being pressured by
the city to sell cheap rather than rebuild.

*

No mention of Special Agent Coleen Rowley's
memo to the FBI about 9/11 after 21 years on the job.
Though she was one of TIME's persons of the year, 2002,
all of whom were whistleblowers, all of whom were women.
The others brought down Enron and Worldcom, and not much
mention of them, either.

*

What about those in Congress who were advised of wiretaps?
Was it only a dozen?  Were they sworn to not tell anyone,
even other members of Congress?


*DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

"We will rebuild the hurricane damage to the poor."

or

"We will rebuild the hurricane damage for the rich."



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

New Orleans WILL have Mardi Gras.



*STRANGE QUOTES OF THE WEEK

"The only ones complaining about trailers
are those already living in houses."

ABC World News Tonight  12/20


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

There will be a "leap second" added between 2005
and 2006 to correct for some slowing of rotation
of the earth, mostly due to drag from the moon.

This is a common occurance, done 7 years ago and
some 21 times since Greenwich Mean Time began in
1884.  [Also called Coordinated Universal Time]

*

Movie theater grosses are down 14% over last year
for the holiday season, but the statistics do not
include any reference to the fact that more money
is coming in from video rentals than theaters.

*

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.

POEM OF THE WEEK


Prediction

Facilitators again pop up at me
through covers of books, pictures in motion,
songs I sometimes listen to when I'm ready to listen

saying things I thought I knew
but then realized I never quite got
growing in me a sort of feeling that resembles maturity
as a non-profit living in a profit oriented world

grey skies readily situated me
on the brink of a paradise lost situation
when I met this man; he sang Happy Birthday to Jesus
every Christmas while this woman he loved was mailing
gifts to Santa Claus

the child I hold within still listens hard
the chimes of freedom are ringing again on their
veranda; let my soul be yours this very moment
the new year breathes its first breaths

the swing they sit on makes little squeaking noises,
the night is chilly, their feet covered in fluffy blankets.
A tiara of fireflies lights up an airy path

thoughts wander on while reading from the classics:
two books for a dollar again this year
wonderers like marlins dive into the depth of each other's eyes.
The Moon predicts they'll always keep them open.
