.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.
 
The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at
 
  http://gutenberg.org/find
 
which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.
 
Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:
 
  http://gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL
 
If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:
 
  http://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL
 
That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.
 
And to directly access the file directories:
 
  http://gutenberg.org/dirs/
 
Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

                       [ This Week's Other Stuff ]
=============================================================================

Today, I would like to recommend to you a book I have only recently noticed.
Book #2274, "How to Live on 24 Hours a Day" by Arnold Bennett.  The title
alone intruiged me when I saw this book (the real thing) on a stack of
donations that had arrived to me from the local library.  I simply could not
resist starting to read it as I am simply horrible at living in the time
allotted (as evidence I cite the fact that I started reading a book instead of
processing the donations to Distributed Proofreaders as I had intended!).
This book is exceedingly well written.  Those of you who are inclined to read
it should also jot down the writings of the following:

Marcus Aurelius:  Meditations(#2680) and Thoughts(#6920)
Epictetus: Golden Sayings(#871) and Discourses(#10661)
Emerson: Essays(#2944-5) and Representative Men(#6312)
Meredith: Complete Works(#4500)
Bogehot: Lombard Street(#4359)
Tolstoy: Anna Karenina(#1399)
Milton: Paradise Lost(#26)
Gibbon: Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire(#731-736)

As the author encourages you to read some of at least one at one point.  Here
are two samples from the work:

"Strange that the newspapers, so enterprising and up-to-date as they are, are
not full of 'How to live on a given income of time,' instead of 'How to live
on a given income of money'!  Money is far commoner than time.  When one
reflects, one perceives that money is jut about the commonest thing there is.
It encumbers the earth in gross heaps."

"If you imagine that you will be able to achieve your ideal by ingeniously
planning out a time-table with a pen on a piece of paper, you had better give
up hope at once.  If you are not prepared for discouragements and
disillusions; if you will not be content with a small result for a big effort,
then do not begin.  Lie down again and resume the uneasy doze which you call
your existence."

Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities. Truth isn't. - Mark Twain
