Disks and controllers on four Prairienet servers are being upgraded.
These servers will be unavailable at various times next Wednesday,
September 28th from 8am until work is completed.

Thus I am currently planning to post the Newsletter a day early
or a day late, either on Tuesday or Thursday, but I may try to
get it out Wednesday, in between outages.
