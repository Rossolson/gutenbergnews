v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly

do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 15,247 eBooks online as of February 02, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$1.05 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,112,028 x 15,247 x $1.05 = $1+ trillion

With 15,247 eBooks online as of February 26, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.66 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.89 when we had 11,219 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 15,247 eBooks in 33 Years and 07.00 Months We Averaged
      ~454 Per Year
        37.8 Per Month
         1.24 Per Day

At 291 eBooks Done In The 28 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      10.4 Per Day
      73 Per Week
     291 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

SHAKEOUT IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS FORECAST
Experts are predicting a major shakeout in the consumer electronics
industry, similar to the one computer makers endured two decades ago.
Hordes of upstart rivals, plummeting prices and a host of new technologies
are pummeling profits at industry stalwarts such as Sony, Pioneer and
Philips Electronics. "We're seeing price depreciation that would have been
unimaginable in the past," says Sony chief strategy officer Katsumi Ihara.
"What's behind it is that with the switch to digital components, anyone can
make them and there aren't compelling ways to distinguish one's products."
In an effort to cope with the onslaught of mass look-alikes, the big
electronic makers have scrambled to control the few key components that
still yield reasonable profit margins, such as flat-panel displays. That,
in turn, has led to a debilitating supply glut, with LCD prices falling 40%
since last summer. The result has been a refocusing on the part of Philips
and Thomson SA of France, which are now placing more emphasis on medical
equipment and broadcasting gear, respectively. Meanwhile, Sony and Samsung
are finding new life in cooperative ventures, teaming up to build the
world's largest LCD panel factory. Hitachi, Toshiba and Matsushita are
following suit, with an LCD plant that will open next year. The bottom line
will be good for consumers, however, as electronics manufacturers struggle
to churn out innovative products at ever-lower prices.

REPORT URGES DEGREE PROGRAMS FOR ONLINE EDUCATION
A new report from the Alliance for Higher Education Competitiveness
identifies degree programs as the single largest factor that determines
whether a distance education program is successful. In preparing the
report, "Achieving Success in Internet-Supported Learning in Higher
Education," the group conducted a survey of 21 distance education
programs it deemed successful. Among those schools, 89 percent offered
online degrees rather than just online courses. "It's easier to
measure the progress at a programmatic level," according to the
report's author, Rob Abel, president of the alliance. "The
programmatic approach also gets institutions thinking about
student-support services," Abel continued. Among the institutions
profiled in the study is the University of Florida, which currently has
more than 6,000 students enrolled in distance education programs.
According to William H. Riffee, associate provost for distance,
continuing, and executive education at the university, the program was
a response to growing numbers of students who wanted degrees from the
university, which could not handle them all. Riffee attributes his
school's success to its having scaled the program effectively. The
report also identified the for-profit institution Westwood College as
successful. Shaun McAlmont, president of Westwood College Online,
credits some of the success to the agility of the for-profit
educational industry, compared to traditional higher education, which
he said is slow to change.

SUN MOVES SOLARIS TO OPEN SOURCE
Sun Microsystems has announced it will make its Solaris 10 operating
system available as an open source product. Sun has lost ground to
companies including Dell and HP that increasingly offer Linux-based
products. Changing consumer sentiment regarding proprietary systems has
left Sun defending its products, and the company's latest move is
designed to persuade developers to once again consider Sun's
technology. The open source Solaris will be available free of charge,
and developers will be able to make changes to the operating system to
improve it as they see fit. According to John Loiacono, executive vice
president for software at Sun, the goal is to get more developers using
Solaris, thereby increasing opportunities for Sun to sell its other
products and hardware. The company also announced it would modify its
stance on intellectual property and allow free use of 1,600 of the
patents it holds on the Solaris operating system.

MICROSOFT TO LIMIT DOWNLOADS TO LEGAL SOFTWARE OWNERS
Microsoft will soon begin requiring users to employ a program called
Windows Genuine Advantage before downloading software patches or
updates. The program verifies that the computer requesting the download
is running a legitimate copy of Windows software rather than a pirated
or counterfeit version. Initially, the requirement will apply to users
in China, Norway, and the Czech Republic, but it will include all users
by the middle of the year. Users will still be able to receive software
updates and patches using the Automatic Updates feature. The program is
part of Microsoft's three-pronged approach to limiting software
piracy: educating users, designing products that discourage illegal
copying, and legal enforcement. In addition to allowing downloads, the
program will also offer users discounts on Microsoft products and
services. Analysts noted that although the obvious benefit of the
program is to Microsoft by way of decreasing the incidence of software
piracy, users stand to benefit as well. Ensuring that a computer is
running a legitimate version of an operating system shields that
computer from bugs and glitches associated with pirated software, while
guaranteeing that patches and upgrades will work properly.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


First Amendment On The Decline


A University of Connecticut study sponored by the Knight Foundation
reports from their massive study of 112,003 students  7,889 teachers
and 327 school principals:

36% believe newspapers should get "government approval" before publishing.
     13% had no opinion, leaving 51% for a free press.

32% say the press has "too much" freedom.
10% say the press has too little freedom.
37% say the amount of press freedom is just right.

75% thought flag burning was illegal.



*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

We are the enemies of democracy,
and all those who promote democracy.
We believe in the will of God.

Subject:  Reaction to Harvard's president
Summers' comments about women in science

This reminds me of the famous Dr. Clark (Harvard also)
comments from around the 1850's.  Education was bad for
women because studying took necessary nutrients away from
the ovaries and sent them to the brain.  His proof:
educated women had fewer children.

At least the distribution of eBooks is done in a manner
that is not based on color, creed, gender, religion, etc.
However, those of us in areas in which the vast majority
not only have computers but also have Internet access,
and even over half have high speed Internet access, must
take some time to consider that most of the world has no
access at all to computers or the Internet.  Nearly half
the people in the world have never been part of a plain,
non-emergency phone call.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

There will be a race in May to see which happens first:

Star Wars:  The Revenge of the Sith

or

The resumption of the Space Shuttle flights



*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


The single greatest cause of personal bankruptcy in the US:

Unpaid medical bills

[Is there any other country in which this is the case?

*

We don't usually associate smog advisories with the
middle of winter, but there is just such an "air quality
alert" [to put it in NewSpeak] for a handful of counties
surrounding Terra Haute, Indiana, and apparently a few
more in northern Indiana.  [Terra Haute is south of
Indianapolis, not far from Illinois.]

*

This year, for the first time the photographic industry
will be predominantly digital as opposed to film.

*

For the last year we have been reporting on China's growth,
and once mentioned [here or elsewhere] that China was buying
up all the scrap metal available in the entire world.

This struck close to home yesterday, as 30 salaried employees
came to work to find they had no jobs as a result of there being
not enough scrap metal here in the Heartland to keep them working.

Most of you have probably seen something like this:

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
