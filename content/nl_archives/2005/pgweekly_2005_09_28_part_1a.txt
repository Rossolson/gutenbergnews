STATISTICAL CHANGES

Due to various changes in our statistical reporting and coverage,
the accuracy of the weekly count of the number of eBooks will not
be as redundantly checked by a human count, and we will rely more
on the automated system.

***If you notice any inconsistencies, please send email to:

hart AT pglaf DOT org

For example, last week we reported 40 new eBooks, but in recounts
it appears that we counted three extras.  These three have been a
consistent source of extra counts or short counts over the month.

*Headline News from Edupage

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

EU DATA-RETENTION PLANS DRAW CRITICISM
Peter Hustinx, data protection supervisor for the European Union (EU),
has voiced his criticism of two antiterrorism proposals for their
stance on data retention. Neither the proposal by the European
Commission nor one drafted by EU governments makes a compelling case
for holding on to sensitive data as part of antiterrorism efforts, said
Hustinx. The EU proposal, he noted, would allow for the retention of
information such as times of phone calls for up to three years. Hustinx
said that any measures put forth should comply with the European
Convention on Human Rights. Those that do not are "not just
unacceptable but illegal." The chair of the EU negotiations, British
Home Secretary Charles Clarke, is urging European governments to forgo
some measure of civil liberties in return for broader authority for law
enforcement to investigate suspected terrorists.

NEW TOOLS RATE SAFETY OF WEB SITES
Two new tools from GeoTrust offer Internet users another layer of
protection against a range of online scams. The TrustWatch Search site
and TrustWatch Toolbar both provide indications about the probable
reliability of sites users are visiting, in an effort to help consumers
avoid being victimized by phishing scams or by other forms of
fraudulent Web sites. The tools evaluate sites for security practices
such as certain forms of authentication or use of a Secure Sockets
Layer certificate. Sites are also screened against a black list of
known fraud sites and checked for patterns that would indicate
potentially malicious intent. Users are shown a green signal to
indicate a verified site, a yellow signal for suspect sites, and a red
signal for sites that cannot be verified. The toolbar provides users
with a real-time screen for sites they visit; the search site returns
search results--powered by Ask Jeeves--with one of the three indicators
for each site returned.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

[As requested adding sources, etc., when possible.]


EVOLUTION LAWSUIT OPENS IN PENNSYLVANIA
from The New York Times (Registration Required)

HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 26 - Intelligent design is not science, has no
support from any major American scientific organization and does not belong
in a public school science classroom, a prominent biologist testified on the
opening day of the nation's first legal battle over whether it is permissible
to teach the fledgling "design" theory as an alternative to evolution.

"To my knowledge, every single scientific society that has taken a position
on this issue has taken a position against intelligent design and in favor
of evolution," said the biologist, Kenneth R. Miller, a professor at Brown
University and the co-author of the widely used high school textbook "Biology."

Eleven parents in the small town of Dover, just south of here, are suing
their school board for introducing intelligent design in the ninth-grade
biology curriculum. The parents accuse the board of injecting religious
creationism into science classes in the guise of intelligent design.
Professor Miller, their main expert witness, was the only person to take
the stand on Monday.

"You know that the arrest of Mr. Safavian, one of three known Abramoff
alumni to migrate into the administration, is the start of something big.
Alberto Gonzales's Justice Department announced it only after Mr. Safavian
had appeared in court and had been released without bail. The gambit was
clearly intended to keep the story off television, and it worked."

"Safavian's arrest comes less than a year after a high-level Air Force
procurement official, Darleen Druyun, went to prison for trading
favorable multibillion-dollar contracts for a top job with Boeing Co."

Safavian was in charge of procurement of all the hurrican relief
until he was brought up on charges.  The specific charges are that
he lied to a General Services Administration Ethics Officer,
and other investigators about the Abramoff Scottish golf junket.
In addition there were properties owned by the US government
in DC and MD that were allegedly going to be sold to Safavian
for his own private development plans.

Safavian and Abramoff worked at Preston Gates Ellis' law firm
starting in early 1995.  They both moved to the area of various
gambling interests, including Indian casinos in later in the 90s.
Safavian's wife, Jennifer is Chief Counsel for Oversight and
Investigations on the House Government Reform Committee,
which is chaired by Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.  Abramoff was recently
indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges by a federal grand jury,
re: attempts to buy a number of Flordia gaming ships, and is still
under Conngressional investigation for alegedly swindling millions
from the very Indian tribes he was hired by as their lobbyist.

The New York Times  9/25


[Remember that in the news business, Friday is called "Garbage Day."
Stories that are meant not to be reported are done or released on a
Friday so that by Monday, when everyone is back in the news loop,
the story is already dead.  The charges were filed Friday Sept. 16,
and it was very quietly all over by Monday morning.]




*STRANGE WORDS OF THE WEEK

"Many of the people in the arena here, you know, were underprivileged anyway,"
she said after touring the Astrodome, "so this is working very well for them.")

Barbara Bush, as quoted in the New York Times    9/25



*STRANGE QUOTES OF THE WEEK


"To my knowledge, every single scientific society that has taken a position
on this issue has taken a position against intelligent design and in favor
of evolution," said the biologist, Kenneth R. Miller, a professor at Brown
University and the co-author of the widely used high school textbook "Biology."

[Previously, there has been no report that this was so unanimous.]



*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


More than 50% of the US populations lives within 50 miles of a coastline.


". . .authorities were sufficiently concerned about hurricanes that
last year they pre-positioned 10,000 body bags in New Orleans."

New York Times  9/25

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
