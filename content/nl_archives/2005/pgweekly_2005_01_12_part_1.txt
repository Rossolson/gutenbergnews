The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, January 12, 2005 PT1
*******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971*****


       15,000 eBooks listed as of this week, see PT2 for details!!!


Whew!
It's perhaps only due to luck that this Newsletter is going out today with
all the usual updates and features, as this computer was knocked out during
the most violent single lightning strike I have ever been so very close to.
I have rebooted just in time to get the progress report figures, and should
have time to include all the normal news articles, etc.


Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com

v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listes are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

EASIER TERABYTES

New .5T drives have been announced at reasonable prices.

This will allow users with only one free dual IDE controller
to add a terabyte of hard drive space for about $1,000.

If you have two free dual IDE controllers, this can be done
for about $400 at the best prices we have seen, using 250G drives.

In addition, there are RAID 5 teraboxes available at ~$1,000
with all sorts of backup and restore features.
Details on request.

REQUEST FOR RUSSIAN TRANSLATOR

We are trying to start up a Project Gutenberg Russian Team,
and we need someone to translate simple email messages from
members of Project Gutenberg who want to provide a service
to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,
we need them translated into English, also in a .doc file.
Thanks!!!     Contact Jared Buck  <JBuck814366460@aol.com>

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 15,035 eBooks online as of January 12, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of $1.05 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,112,028 x 15,050 x $1.05 = $1+ trillion

With 15,035 eBooks online as of January 05, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.67 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.93 when we had 11,001 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

Can you imagine ~15,035 books each costing ~$.24 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~15,035 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 15,035 eBooks in 33 Years and 06.25 Months We Averaged
       449 Per Year   [We do about 3/4 that much per month these days!]
        37.4 Per Month
         1.23 Per Day

At 79 eBooks Done In The 7 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      11 Per Day
      79 Per Week
     356 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

THE NEW SHAPE OF PC CARDS
The credit-card-size PC cards for adding functions to notebook
computers are about to be replaced by "ExpressCards" that are half the size
and bear an orange rabbit logo to indicate they can handle high-definition
TV broadcast viewing and high-speed storage. Backed by Microsoft, Intel, and
Dell, the new cards will eventually be used on desktop PCs -- thereby
eliminating the need to open the computer to install hardware upgrades.

U.S. SCHOOLS ARE RELUCTANT USERS OF TECHNOLOGY

[Why do schools fear technology?  Too much independent learning?]

A report from the Department of Education says that although virtually
all U.S. schools are now connected to the Internet (with one computer for
every five students), many educators remain doubtful about the benefits of
online learning. Secretary of Education Ron Paige says in the National
Education Technology Plan: "Education is the only business still debating
the usefulness of technology. Schools remain unchanged for the most part
despite numerous reforms and increased investments in computers."

HACKERS HIT GEORGE MASON
George Mason University has become the latest institution of higher
education to be the victim of hackers' accessing personal information
of faculty and students. University officials said that hackers gained
access to information including names, photos, Social Security numbers,
and campus ID numbers for "all members of the Mason community who have
identification cards." An e-mail sent by the university's vice
president for information technology indicated that the intruders
appeared to be seeking "access to other campus systems rather than
specific data," but the message warned that the information the hackers
obtained could be used for identity theft. George Mason had ended its
practice of putting Social Security numbers on ID cards, replacing them
with university-generated numbers, in response to a Virginia state law
that required such a change. The university maintains a database,
however, that includes Social Security numbers. University officials
discovered the intrusion on January 3 and said the hackers gained
access to records of more than 30,000 faculty, staff, and students.

NEW QUESTIONS ARISE OVER SCHOLARLY REPUBLISHING
A librarian at Cornell University has uncovered evidence that academic
publisher Emerald has for many years republished articles in its
journals without acknowledging previous publication. Philip M. Davis
first noticed republished articles dating back to 1989 in online
archives maintained by Emerald. Davis then broadened his search to
include paper copies of Emerald journals going back to 1979 and said he
found many more examples of such republished articles. Davis said some
articles were published more than once in the same journal, several
years apart, and noted that as a result libraries may have spent money
on material they already owned. A spokesperson from Emerald said the
company does not have a practice of republishing, though in some cases
Emerald officials who thought a particular article especially valuable
would republish it "to make it available to another audience." Davis said,
"It's clearly unethical to republish materials without attribution."

1951   Douglas Hartree tells Ferranti Ltd, of Manchester, England,
"As the three existing computer projects will suffice to handle all the
calculations that will ever be needed in England, Ferranti would be
well advised to drop the idea of making computers for commercial sale."
