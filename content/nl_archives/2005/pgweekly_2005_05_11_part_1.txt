**The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, May 11, 2005  PT1**
*******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971******

Note:  Several last minute changes were made due to finding some errors in
numbers recorded weeks or months ago, and I managed to change most of them
right now, but not all.  I hope to get them all corrected next week.  The
changes are small, mostly errors of one or two eBooks counted twice.

Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com

Please note that PT2 of this Newsletter is currently in flux, as we shift
from to an automated PT2 sender.  The situation with Monthly Newsletters
is in flux to an even greater degree.  Our apologies as we make changes.

downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.


*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics

=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 16,206 eBooks online as of May 11, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.96 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,408,278 x 16,209 x $.96 = ~$1 trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 16,206 eBooks online as of May 11, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.62 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.79 when we had 12,642 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 16,205 eBooks in 33 Years and 10.25 Months We Averaged
      ~479 Per Year
        39.9 Per Month
         1.31 Per Day

At 1250 eBooks Done In The 126 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      10 Per Day
      70 Per Week
     295 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

of the software that runs as a Java plug-in for browsers. Previously,
the software, which returns search results in a circular "map," was
only available as a separate, $49 application. The company will now
depend on revenue from advertisements placed next to search results by
search engine Yahoo. For the past nine months, 2,000 students and
faculty of Stanford University have been testing the Grokker software,
which has earned a strong following there. Michael A. Keller,
Stanford's head librarian and an adviser to Groxis, said the
application allows users to find appropriate information more quickly.
Another company, Vivisimo, is developing a search engine that, while
still text-based, displays groups of folders next to ranked lists of
results. The folders give users another method of sifting through
search results for useful resources.

STUDENT SHUTS DOWN BLOG AFTER THREAT FROM SINGAPORE
Chen Jiahao, a graduate student in chemical physics at the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has shut down his personal blog and
issued two apologies after an agency of the government in Singapore
threatened to sue Chen for defamation. A*Star, the agency in Singapore
dealing with science and research, accused Chen, who is from Singapore,
of libelous statements that "went way beyond fair comment." The agency
demanded a public apology but said Chen's first apology was insincere
and insisted on another. A*Star said it welcomes various opinions and
perspectives, but many in the journalism community rejected that claim.
Singapore has long had a reputation for using tactics including
lawsuits to silence critics. Organizations including the Committee to
Protect Journalists and Reporters without Borders have decried
Singapore's threats to Chen and journalists. "Chen criticized some of
A*Star's policies," said Julien Pain, head of Reporters without
Borders' Internet freedom desk, "but there was nothing defamatory in
what he wrote."

APPEALS COURT REJECTS BROADCAST FLAG
A federal appeals court has struck down regulations passed by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to control unauthorized
dissemination of digital broadcasting signals. At issue was a
"broadcast flag," a technology that would be added to digital signals
that would prevent them from being distributed over the Internet. The
FCC's regulation would also have required makers of video-recording
equipment to modify their products to support the broadcast-flag
technology. The American Library Association filed a case arguing that
the regulation would impose undue restrictions on libraries, preventing
them from distributing digital content to online classrooms. Consumer
groups had also opposed the regulation, arguing it would drive up costs
of electronic products and would keep consumers from making legitimate
copies of digital works. In its ruling, the court said flatly that the
FCC had overstepped its authority in issuing the regulation.

DARTMOUTH NEARS COMPLETION OF NETWORK CONVERGENCE
Dartmouth College expects this fall to complete a project begun in 2001
to converge the school's phone, cable, and wireless systems into a
single network. When finished, the network--described as the first of
its kind at a U.S. university--will give students and faculty wireless
access to the university's online services, including cable television
and telephone, from anywhere on campus. In addition, the network will
allow users to create individual "channels," which can include various
forms of video content with a cable-quality signal. Channels could be
set up, for example, to let students view video snippets of lectures
when choosing classes. Having a network that allows students to watch
cable programming any time, from anywhere on campus, including during
class, has some worried about keeping students focused on studies, but
university officials are optimistic that the network will offer
compelling tools for professors to hold students' attention. Dartmouth
said it saved more than $2 million by installing its new network when
old systems needed to be replaced, and the network reportedly saves
close to $1 million each year on maintenance and other costs.

APPLE WORKS FOR SCHOOL IBOOK DEAL
A tentative deal between Apple Computer and the Cobb County School
District in Georgia could see as many as 63,000 iBook computers going
to teachers and students in the district. The school board has already
given its approval to the purchase of 17,000 iBooks, for all teachers
and for students at four high schools. If approved, the program could
be expanded to include all students in the district. Apple's efforts
to persuade school districts to provide a computer for every
student--what it calls its one-to-one solutions--are aimed at regaining
ground in the education market that has been lost to companies selling
Windows-based products, most notably Dell. In 2001, Apple signed a
four-year deal with the Henrico County Public Schools in Virginia, only
to see that contract given to Dell last week when it came up for
renewal. Officials of Cobb County said they were aware of the situation
at Henrico when they selected Apple but that the problems with that
contract had been overcome. Henrico wanted the Microsoft Office
software suite on their computers and didn't have it, according to Jay
Dillion, a spokesperson for Cobb County. "We ... required Apple to
pre-load Office on all our iBooks."

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

General Kirkpatrick was busted to Colonel for Abu Ghraib events.



*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

"The mainstream media is giving equal weight to fact and spin."

Jeaneane Garafolo


DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

It turns out that government and military officials knew
sat on the knowledge that that NFL star Pat Tillman been
killed by "friendly fire" for weeks, waiting to figure
out the best time, place and manner to release the data.

*

Given court rulings and new bills signed into law, it is
now easier for corporations to declare bankruptcy to get
out of their pension plan responsibilities, but in great
reversal, it is now harder for bankruptcy to be declared
by an individual or family.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Graphical representations of search data, see above,
will become a major information tool.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

10 years ago 40% of workers were covered by pensions.

Today it is only 20%, and half of those are underfunded.

*

The divorce rate in the U.S. passed 1/2 some time ago,
and is now about half way to 2/3.

*

You've probably seen something like this statistic:

"A billion dollars ago was only 8 hours and 20 minutes,
at the rate Washington spends it."


Then:

"This may have been true a half a billion seconds ago, too,
but now they're spending faster, so it doesn't take so long.
It's less than five hours."


And lately:


"It's 3 hours, 30 minutes now, for the feds to spend a billion USD,
not counting some off-budget expenditures."

*

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
