v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any

REQUEST FOR RUSSIAN TRANSLATOR

We are trying to start up a Project Gutenberg Russian Team,
and we need someone to translate simple email messages from
members of Project Gutenberg who want to provide a service
to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,
we need them translated into English, also in a .doc file.
Thanks!!!     Contact Jared Buck  <JBuck814366460@aol.com>

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 15,172 eBooks online as of January 26, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of $1.05 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,112,028 x 15,050 x $1.05 = $1+ trillion

With 15,172 eBooks online as of January 26, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.66 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.90 when we had 11,001 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

Can you imagine ~15,172 books each costing ~$.24 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~15,172 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 15,172 eBooks in 33 Years and 06.75 Months We Averaged
      ~450 Per Year
        37.5 Per Month
         1.23 Per Day

At 216 eBooks Done In The 21 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      10.3 Per Day
      72 Per Week
     270 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


'ROBO-SOLDIER' PREPARES FOR IRAQ
The U.S. Army is sending 18 remote-controlled robotic soldiers called
SWORDS (Special Weapons Observation Reconnaissance Detection Systems) to
Iraq, but they are not the autonomous killer robots of science fiction: a
SWORDS robot shoots only when its human operator presses a button (after
identifying a target on video shot by the robot's cameras). Jim Lowrie,
president of Perceptek, one of the firms developing robotics systems for the
military, says: "For the foreseeable future, there always will be a person
in the loop who makes the decision on friend or foe. That's a hard problem
to determine autonomously." (Washington Post 24 Jan 2005)
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31968-2005Jan24.html>

LONG LIVE THE LAPTOP!
We've apparently entered the age of laptops: during the past holiday
season U.S. retail stores sold 24% more laptops than during the same period
in 2003, whereas desktop computers fell 7% in the same period. The report
comes from research company Current Analysis. Intel vice president Mooly
Eden provides confirming data: "Between 2001 and 2004, we more than doubled
the amount of notebooks in the market. Between 2004 and 2008, we believe the
market will double again." (USA Today 23 Jan 2005)

PEW STUDY FINDS SEARCHER MISPERCEPTIONS
A new study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project has found
that only 1 in 6 users of Internet search engines can tell the difference
between unbiased search results and paid advertisements. All of the major
search engines return a mix of regular results (based solely on relevance to
the search terms entered) and sponsored links (for which a Web site had paid
advertising fees). Only 38% of Web searchers are aware of the distinction,
and of those only 47% can always tell which are paid -- even though they're
usually labeled by the search engines. PEW researcher Deborah Fallows says:
"We're still in the infancy of the Internet. People are still kind of so
pleased that they can go there, ask for something and get an answer that
it's kind of not on their radar screen to look in a very scrutinizing way to
see what's in the background there." (AP 24 Jan 2005)

MICROSOFT: SOFTWARE FIXES AREN'T FOR PIRATES

[Microsoft will now require a network connection to your computer?]
[Of course, the highly security conscious people at the Fortune 500
won't be subjected to this. . .or will they?]

Microsoft will soon be requiring that Windows XP users verify that
their copy of the software is genuine before they'll be able to receive
"greater reliability, faster access to updates, and richer user
experiences." Although users of pirated copies of Windows will still be able
get security patches, they won't be able to get other enhancements to
Windows. The company will be expanding a trial authentication program it
began last fall, and will make mandatory in mid-2005 for all users seeking
to access software updates, downloads and security fixes for Windows.

the Internet, will defend 19-year-old Nicholas Ciarelli against a lawsuit
brought by Apple charging the Harvard freshman and Web publisher revealing
Apple trade secrets on his Web site, www.ThinkSecret.com. Gross, whose
services will be given on a pro bono basis, says that his client used proper

THOUSANDS OF LAPTOPS, CELL PHONES LEFT IN CABS
A new survey estimates that 11,300 laptops, 31,400 handheld devices and
200,000 mobile phones were left in taxis around the world during the
last six months. The survey, which polled some 1,000 taxi drivers and
extrapolated from there, indicates that four out of five cell phones and 19
out of 20 laptops were returned to their owners eventually. Geographically,
Chicagoans were most likely to leave a handheld device in a cab, while
Londoners were more careless than others with their laptops. Danes seemed
to be most likely to forget their cell phones. Other items reportedly left
in cabs include a harp, dentures, artificial limbs and a baby.

CARNIVORE IS DEAD
According to two recent reports to Congress, the FBI has put an end to
its electronic surveillance tool, known as Carnivore. Despite claims
from federal officials that they need expanded access to electronic
communications, the system was widely criticized by civil liberties
groups as being overly invasive and for not respecting individuals'
privacy. The reports, which the Electronic Privacy Information Center
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, note that the FBI did
not use the system for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and instead used
commercially available monitoring software. According to the reports,
the FBI engaged in court-ordered Internet surveillance 13 times during
those years.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

Turnout in this week's elections in Iraq appear as if
it will be surprisingly small.



*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

"The Iraqis want to vote, they want to
particpate in democracy."  George W. Bush

Strange in light of the the 7% registration
in the US mentioned below, particularly as
compared to a world wide 14% registration.


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Iraq locals will say the newly elected government
is merely a puppet created by the United States,
particularly if there is only a voter registration
of a small minority and/or actual votes cast.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Only 7% of Iraqi citizens in the United States have
registered to vote in this week's elections, though
registration dates have been extended.

Most of you have probably seen something like this:

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
