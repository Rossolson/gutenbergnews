*******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971******
 
Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com
 
Please note that we are still in the process of correcting our statistical
program data.  Last week we subtracted a few that we thought had been in a
duplicate count situation, but either that correction didn't stick or some
new similar problem has occured.  As always, the total count should be the
consideration of some attention as to possibly being off by a few eBooks.
 
Please note that PT2 of this Newsletter is currently in flux, as we shift
from to an automated PT2 sender.  The situation with Monthly Newsletters
is in flux to an even greater degree.  Our apologies as we make changes.

v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.
 
   http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300
 
 
Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.
 
Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact

These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.
 
If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~45,714 Unique eBooks
 
If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~34,286 Unique eBooks
 
***
 
Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/
 
In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.
 
You can try a new IPL service at:
 
http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/
 
It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.
 
Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES
 
 
Please visit the site:
 
http://www.pgdp.net
 
for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.
 
If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.
 
Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.
 
Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.
 
Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:
 
http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html
 
to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to
 
dphelp@pgdp.net
 
Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.
 
Please contact us at:
 
dphelp@pgdp.net

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???
 
With 16,473 eBooks online as of June 15, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.94 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,479,466 x 16,463 x $.94 = ~$1 trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]
 
With 16,473 eBooks online as of June 15, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.61 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.77 when we had 12,950 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!
 
At 16,473 eBooks in 33 Years and 11.50 Months We Averaged
     ~485 Per Year
       40.4 Per Month
        1.33 Per Day
 
At 1517 eBooks Done In The 161 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
    9.4 Per Day
     66 Per Week
    276 Per Month
 
The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.
 
This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

*Headline News from Edupage
 
[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]
 
 
MICROSOFT TO RELEASE UNBUNDLED OPERATING SYSTEM
Microsoft has moved a step closer to compliance with stipulations of a
European Commission (EC) antitrust ruling originally handed down in
March 2004. In addition to a $613 million fine, the EC ordered
Microsoft to offer versions of its operating systems that do not
include the company's Windows Media Player. After recent pressure from
the EC, including threats of additional penalties, Microsoft announced
that unbundled versions--which the company is calling "N" versions--of
Windows XP Home Edition and Professional will be available to computer
makers by June 15 and to retail customers by July 1. Still outstanding
is an EC demand that Microsoft loosen the licensing terms of its
software to promote development of competitive products that will
function with Microsoft's operating systems. Microsoft said it is
working to meet that condition.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA
 
Philip A. Clooney, a White House lawyer with a BA in economics,
has apparently been altering many of the White House statements
concerning Global Warming [or Climate Change, as the spin medic
establishment is attempting to recoin the term].
 
Apparently Mr. Clooney, Esq., has no scientific training, other
than a stint as a lobbyist at the American Petroleum Institute,
where he was the "Climate Team Leader."
 
When The White House was asked for comment, Michele St. Martin,
a White House spokeswoman, said:
 
"We don't put Phil Cooney on the record.
 
"He's not a cleared spokesman."
 
However, his additions and editions of various adjectives and/or
adverbs seem to have been exactly what the spin-doctors at The
White House ordered, as he added the word "extremely" in this:
 
"The attribution of the causes of biological and ecological
changes to climate change or variability is extremely difficult."
 
Here is an even more obvious example:
 
"Many scientific observations indicate that the Earth is undergoing
a period of relatively rapid change."
 
became
 
"Many scientific observations point to the conclusion that the Earth
may be undergoing a period of relatively rapid change."
 
In yet more of this kind of doublespeak, Harlan L. Watson, the chief
climate negotiator for the State Department, said to the BBC last month:
 
"We are still not convinced of the need to move forward quite so quickly,"
"There is general agreement that there is a lot known, but also there is
a lot to be known."
 
I guess the environment is now a negotiable commodity, in the eyes of
The White House, at least.
 
However, try telling that to chemicals we have put there already.

*STRANGE WORDS OF THE WEEK
 
When Mr. Evers, former head of MCI-Worldcom appeared in Congress
to answer questions, he refused to even answer the simple query,
as to whether he was the Mr. Evers who had headed MCI-Worlcom--
claiming his 5th Amendment rights again self-incrimination.
 
Or should that one go under doublespeak?
 
Source:  The Congressional Record
 
 
 
DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK
 
Recent news stories have reported various project to "harden"
various "Public Safety Building," but the stories were sparse.
 
1.  "Harden" means to make them more resistant to attack.
 
2.  "Public Safety Building" = "Police Station"
 
 
 
*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK
 
There will be no 6 month report from Google Print in the media
to follow up their huge media blitz from December 14, 2004.
 
 
*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK
 
The Illinois state budget was very quietly signed into law by
the governor this week, as the pension fund was raided to do
the magic of budget balancing.
 
The Republicans, in a fit of fiscal responsibility, berated
the governor for taking money from the pension fund at 8.5%
when it could have been borrowed commercially for 3.5%.
 
I suppose calling this a balanced budget might place this in
the Doublespeak column..  . .

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
 
"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:
 
57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
 8 Africans
 52 would be female
 48 would be male
 70 would be non-white
 30 would be white
 70 would be non-Christian
 30 would be Christian
  6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
  and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
 1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
 1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
 1 would own a computer
 
I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.
 
I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.
 
If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.
 
I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.
 
BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.
 
This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.

POEM OF THE WEEK
 
sounds
 
my flute fills with sandalwood fragrance
the air is adorned with jewels of smoke
they tenderly encircle the heart of a cloud
the skies ablaze return caressing rain
my helpless lips have found delicious burden
a garland of melodies is my breath
