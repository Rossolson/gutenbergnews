v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 15,887 eBooks online as of March 30, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.98 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,275,850 x 15,887 x $.98 = $1+ trillion

[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 15,887 eBooks online as of March 30, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.63 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.82 when we had 12,145 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 15,887 eBooks in 33 Years and 08.80 Months We Averaged
      ~480 Per Year
        40.0 Per Month
         1.32 Per Day

At 931 eBooks Done In The 84 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      11.08 Per Day
      78 Per Week
     333 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

FCC ALLOWS BELLS TO BUNDLE DSL
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ruled that local phone
companies cannot be compelled to offer stand-alone DSL service to
customers who purchase phone service from other providers. Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana, and Kentucky had sought to force BellSouth to
unbundle its DSL service from its phone service and sell the high-speed
data service to individuals who bought phone service from other local
providers or from cell-phone companies. BellSouth filed a petition with
the FCC, which narrowly granted the petition on a vote of 3-2. Michael
Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, the two Democrats on the FCC, filed a
dissenting statement expressing their concern that the ruling would
limit consumer choice. "If it is permissible to deny consumers DSL if
they do not also order analog voice service," they wrote, "what stops a
carrier from denying broadband service to an end-user who has cut the
cord and uses only a wireless phone?"

FEDS ORDER BANKS TO DISCLOSE BREACHES
Four federal agencies have released regulations requiring banks and
other financial institutions to notify customers when a security breach
presents a risk that their personal information may be misused. The
Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift
Supervision deliberated for 18 months on how federal legislation,
including the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions (FACT) Act, should
be interpreted. The resulting "guidance" stipulates that when personal
information is accessed without authorization and misuse of that
information has occurred or is reasonably possible, institutions must
notify affected customers "as soon as possible." In all cases, even
those that do not meet the standard set for notifying customers,
institutions must notify their primary federal regulators of the
breach. Delays in notifying customers are permissible if such
notification is determined to jeopardize an investigation into the breach.
[You can be sure the delays will be long and constant]

ICANN APPROVES EU TOP-LEVEL DOMAIN
Directors of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
approved use of .eu as a country-code top-level domain for use by European
Union countries. EURid officials, who will manage the registry for .eu,
expect the U.S. Department of Commerce to approve the decision shortly.
The introduction of .eu is not expected to affect use of already popular
country codes such as .de for Germany or .uk for the United Kingdom.

BLUE GENE/L SPEED RECORD BROKEN, BY BLUE GENE/L
The still-unfinished Blue Gene/L supercomputer, being built by IBM at
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has reached a processing
speed of 135.3 trillion floating point operations per second
(teraflops), smashing the record it set last year of 70.72 teraflops.
When complete, the Blue Gene/L supercomputer will have a theoretical
processing capacity of 360 teraflops. Developers of the machine doubled
the number of racks in the system--to 32--to achieve the new record.
Each rack holds 1,024 processors; Blue Gene will eventually include 64
racks. Scientists at the Lawrence Livermore Lab, which is part of the
U.S. Department of Energy, will use Blue Gene to study the nation's
stockpile of nuclear weapons, without the need to perform dangerous
underground testing.

CRITICISM MOUNTS FOR FEDERAL STUDENT DATABASE
The U.S. Department of Education has proposed creating a national
database of college students, but the idea has drawn heavy criticism
for its use of Social Security numbers to identify individuals. The
current system for reporting student progress, the Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System, reports aggregate data for
institutions and cannot accurately track students who start at one
college or university and transfer to another. The proposed database
would track individuals, offering more accurate data for graduation
rates and other statistics, but some argue that those gains would come
at the expense of student privacy. David Baime, vice president of
government relations for the American Association of Community
Colleges, said that despite the benefits to community colleges in
particular from such a system, his organization opposes the plan
"primarily due to privacy concerns, expressed to us by our members."
David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent
Colleges and Universities, said, "The proposal takes us down the
slippery slope toward Big Brother oversight of college students, and of
those same citizens beyond their college years."

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


  WHEN/HOW DID *YOU* HEAR ABOUT THE TEXAS CITY EXPLOSION?

[More "Packaged News" Reporting, Even In Scandal Midst?]


TexasCity has been the location of several of the largest
industrial explosions in all history, and a week ago from
the time you are likely reading this another happened, at
1:28PM, local time [CST].

However, four hours later, when the evening new was on at
CBS, NBC, and ABC, there was no mention of this explosion
in the headlines.

Interestingly enough, the BBC had already reported on the
story earlier and had even had time to relay through PBS,
to millions of non-commercial network news watchers.  The
first ten minutes of those BBC news broadcasts were given
to the Texas City explosion story.

Details:  This refinery is the third largest in the U.S.

15 dead and over 100 injured.

Oil prices were reported as being lower in spite of this.

Yet, gasoline prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange
hit $1.6080 per gallon record highs.

This news lets us calculate exactly how much profits are
made by those who buy gas at $1.61 per gallon and sell a
gallon at the then current average price of $2.06.

$.45 profit on an investment of $1.61 equals 28%.

Of course you have to add in the expense of pumping that
gasoline into your own tank trucks and delivering it for
retail sale to the local gas stations.

*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

Robert Rodriquez, famed movie director of El Mariachi,
Desperado, Spy Kids, Once Upon A Time In Mexico, and a
new movie, Sin City, coming out Friday, said late last
night on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson that a
delegation from the Directors' Guild was on it way for
the purposes of shutting down the filming of Sin City,
when he resigned his membership in the their Directors
Guild so he could share directing credits with Quentin
Tarantino and Frank Miller on the new Sin City movie.

Apparently the Directors' Guild would not allow shared
credits for directing, even in famous cases in which a
director is fired and replaced, then replaced again.
[Not the case with Sin City.]

The film was totally created outside Hollywood studios
and their system of dictating motion picture practices
in great detail.  This puts yet another hole in studio
system history in Hollywood, as Rodriguez and more are
making films on their own and thumbing their noses for
good at Hollywood and its antiquated political powers.

Sin City was made entirely in Austin, Texas.


DOUBLESPEAK OF THE DAY

Doublespeak to avoid the term "invasion" with reference to Panama:

"Operation Just Cause"; "directed our armed forces to protect the
lives of American citizens in Panama"; "deployed forces" to Panama;
conducted "efforts to support the democratic processes in Panama";
assured "the integrity of the Panama Canal", etc.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

No mention will be made of the news embargo about Texas City.



*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


BOOK PRICES SKYROCKET!

Yet book prices never make the news.

The overall inflation rate over the past 50 years has prices today
at about 6 times what they were in 1955.

Gasoline at $2 a gallons is 8 time higher than $.25 in 1955.

The minimum wage is $5.15 as compared to $1 in 1955.

But the price of the average paperback book in 1995 was $.25,
about the same as a gallon of gas.

In 2005 the average price of a paperback is $7.50, or 30 times
as much as it was 50 years ago.

All this hype about gas prices, but never a mention of books.

Tuition is the only other item I could find that went up as much.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
