HEADLINE NEWS

Project Gutenberg of Canada needs your help!

Please email:

pgcanada@lists.pglaf.org

v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.


*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 15,365 eBooks online as of February 09, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$1.02 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,417,750 x 15,365 x $1.02 = $1+ trillion

With 15,365 eBooks online as of February 09, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.65 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.89 when we had 11,320 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 15,365 eBooks in 33 Years and 07.25 Months We Averaged
      ~457 Per Year
        38.1 Per Month
         1.25 Per Day

At 409 eBooks Done In The 35 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      11.7 Per Day
      82 Per Week
     357 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

GREECE BANS E-MAIL SNOOPING
Greece's personal data watchdog has ordered companies not to violate
employee privacy by snooping into their private e-mail. The independent Data
Protection Authority (DPA), whose decisions are binding, has barred firms
from collecting and processing information on workers' communications,
including e-mail. The decision did not include fines. The authority acted on
a complaint by the workers' union of an unnamed company, alleging the
company remote-controlled employees' computers through virtual network
control, specialized software that transmits the screen and keyboard and
mouse clicks between two computers on a network. (The Australian 2 Feb 2005)

WHY BUY WHEN YOU CAN RENT?
Until recently, subscribers to music download services were restricted
in their ability to transfer songs they purchased to portable players,
while Apple has touted the portability of its iTunes service, aimed
at owners of its iPod portable music player. But Napster is hoping to
change all that with its Napster To Go service, which it's promoting in a
SuperBowl ad urging music fans to compare the costs of spending $10,000
to buy and transfer 10,000 songs to an iPod, compared with the $15 per
month fee to carry songs from a catalog of more than a million tracks on
Napster-compatible players. The Napster service will use Microsoft's new
Janus digital rights management software, and manufacturers like Samsung,
iRiver, Gateway and Creative are cranking up production of Janus-compatible
devices ranging in price from about $250 to $500. An IDC analyst predicts the
price eventually will fall below $100, creating tougher competition for Apple.

THAT MUSIC IN THE AIR HAS BECOME A RENT-OR-BUY DECISION
The business model made popular by Apple's iTunes Music Store and its
iPod portable player --  which allows music fans to buy songs by the track
-- is being severely tested not only by new subscription services that treat
music as a pay-as-you-listen proposition, but by Microsoft's new
copy-protection software that allows subscribers to move their rented tracks
from their PCs to portable music players. How does this work? By putting a
timer on the tracks loaded on the player, and automatically checking whether
a user's subscription is still current. Phil Leigh of Inside Digital Media
says, "This is potentially the first serious challenge that the iPod is
going to face. What these devices are going to be able to do is attack iPod
where it's weak." But of course renting and buying can live together in peace:
Jupiter Research's Michael Gartenberg says,  "There's going to have to be
some education in the marketplace. There's some stuff that consumers watch
over the air and on cable but don't actually own and some DVDs consumers
actually go out and buy. There's going to be some coexistence here as well."

WHO GETS TO DECIDE WHAT JOURNALISM IS?

[Talk about reducing a country wide argument to an extreme:  Mom and Son]

A California court will soon decide whether bloggers have the same
legal protections as journalists under "shield" laws that protect reporters
from revealing their sources. Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Kurt
Opsahl, who represents two bloggers targeted by Apple for leaking
information about new company products, maintains that if the bloggers are
forced to give up their sources "the public will lose out on a vital outlet
for independent news, analysis, and commentary." An opposing view is offered
by University of Iowa law professor Randall Bezanson, who says that simply
expressing opinions to a tiny audience isn't journalism -- because if it
were "then I'm a journalist when I write a letter to my mother reporting on
what I'm doing. I don't think the free-press clause [of the U.S. Constitution]
was intended to extend its protections to letters to mothers from sons."

YOUR LYING EYES IN THE PHOTOSHOP AGE

[Who remembers the doctored FBI photograph of the March on Washington
that spelled the end of the Viet Nam War?  It turned out they took the
picture after the march was over, but didn't realize the Washington
Monument was, in fact, a HUGE sundial, and that it was obvious to any
observer that the photograph had been taken hour after the march ended.
Of course, we wouldn't have that problem today, would we?]

Have the ethics of photojournalism been changed in some way by such
software as Adobe Photoshop, which allows easy manipulation of digital
photos? The National Press Photographers Association says it's wrong to
alter the content of a photograph "in any way that deceives the public," and
the director of photography at the Los Angeles Times director of photography
says, "If our readers can't count on honesty from us, I don't know what we
have left." Dartmouth computer science professor Hany Farid is working to
solve the problem of dishonest photographs by developing computer algorithms
that can detect when an image has been altered. But Farid says, "It's a bit
of an arms race. It's tamper and tamper protection, and we can already
predict who's going to win. We simply make it harder" for the average person
with the average amount of skill to get away with photographic deceptions.

SCHOOL DAYS: WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON?
It is increasing commonplace now for teachers and schools to use the
Internet to distribute grades, pending assignments, written comments, class
participation, and disciplinary actions -- and to allow parents to check on
both the academic progress and general activities of their children. One
parent says, "My sixth grader has not bothered to tell me he is failing math
for the first time in his life. I was just perusing [the school's Web site]
and he's got one, two, three, four, five zeros. I have immediately put a
call in to that teacher." The parent adds: "If everybody would use it and
use it more, we could be more involved in our children's education." Yet
Pearson Education, one of the vendors for systems to manage student
information, estimates that only a quarter of its 16,000 school districts
buy the optional parental-access package. Among the reasons schools are
reluctant to use it is that teachers just don't want to let parents quibble
with them about grades. Yet without such systems some parents won't even
know that there's anything to quibble over, because, in the words of another
parent, "Kids don't always bring the bad stuff home." (AP 2 Feb 2005)

SCHOOL NEWS: FIRST AMENDMENT? WHAT FIRST AMENDMENT?
A University of Connecticut survey of more than 100,000 high school
students has found that educators are failing to give high school students
an appreciation of the First Amendment9s guarantees of free speech and a
free press. Commissioned by the Knight Foundation, the $1 million, two-year
study found that nearly three-fourths of high school students either do not
know how they feel about the First Amendment or admit they take it for
granted; seventy-five percent erroneously think flag burning is illegal;
half believe the government can censor the Internet; and more than a third
think the First Amendment goes too far in the rights it guarantees. Knight
Foundation chief executive Hodding Carter III says, 3These results are not
only disturbing; they are dangerous. Ignorance about the basics of this free
society is a danger to our nation9s future.2 (Knight Foundation 31 Jan 2005)

FLAT-PANEL SHAKEUP
Fierce competition from Korean manufacturers is driving down prices
of flat panel displays and eroding profits for many of the companies that
make them. With LCD screen prices down as much as 40% in the last year,
Fujitsu announced it's selling its LCD operation to Sharp for an
undisclosed amount. The divestiture comes on the heels of an announcement
last week that Fujitsu will sell back to Hitachi a large piece of the 50%
stake it has in the companies' plasma display joint venture. "Fujitsu's
been planning an exit strategy for flat panels for some time and it's
finally come to fruition," says an analyst for UFJ Tsubasa Securities in
Tokyo. Meanwhile, Hitachi and Matsushita are joining forces to develop,
manufacture and market plasma displays, a market they hope will prove more
lucrative than LCDs. Matsushita is the world's third-largest maker of
plasma displays after Samsung and LG Electronics. Hitachi will rank No. 4
once it's completed its deal with Fujitsu. (New York Times 8 Feb 2005)

HOLOGRAPHIC DISKS WILL STORE HUNDREDS OF MOVIES
With the competition between the next-generation Blu-ray and HD DVD
technologies still red-hot, technology firms are seeking a cooler solution
for the third-generation DVD. Six leading companies, including Sony, Fuji
Photo, CMC Magnetics and Optware, have formed the Holographic Versatile
Disc (HVD) Alliance in the hope of building a consensus early. The Alliance
says consumers conceivably could store a terabyte of data -- as much as 200
standard DVDs -- on a single HVD disc, and transfer data at over one
gigabit per second, or 40 times faster than a DVD.

DOES GOOGLE FACE COPYRIGHT TROUBLES?
Google's recently announced plans to scan millions of volumes in
several libraries has some wondering if the project is at risk of
running into copyright limitations. Google will scan books that are in
the public domain and make those texts available online; the company
will also scan copyrighted books and offer short excerpts of a few
lines each. Some publishing groups argued that putting even small
pieces online will violate copyright and that the company should seek
explicit permission from copyright owners. Critics also expressed
reservations about copyright determinations for books that might, for
example, be in the public domain in one country but not in another.
Sally C.L. Morris, chief executive of the Association of Learned and
Professional Society Publishers, said that although the sheer number of
academic publishers represents a powerful disincentive to obtaining
permissions from all of them, "that doesn't mean there's not a legal
requirement to do it." For its part, Google insists that its actions
are acceptable. Google spokesperson Steve Langdon said, "In every case,
Google's presentation of the works to the public will keep authors and
publishers in mind and be well within the bounds of copyright law."

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

Apparently Iraqi government forces have been trying to
buy ballot boxes filled with votes they want to change.

AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS. . .OR RATHER 71.6 DAYS !!!

Ellen MacArthur wrote her way into several history book
records this week as she completed her 26,000 mile non-
stop solo sail around the world.  This new world record
of hers of 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes, 33 seconds is
over an entire day faster than the previous record from
Francis Joyon of France.

Praise for her efforts has been coming in worldwide and
also from Mr. Joyon, himself, along with Prime Minister
Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac.  Ellen,
who will now be Dame Ellen, is the youngest person ever
to be awarded Britain's highest honor at the ripest old
age of 28.

However, it would appear this may be just the beginning
for England's newest superstar.  She said she could see
beating that record by about a week with more favorable
weather, as there were severe problems this time.  Some
other world records are already in her sights including
the old clipper ship records from Shanghai to London at
67 days, circumnavigating the British Isles, and a west
to east Atlantic crossing.

These trips are particular grueling as sleep only comes
in 15-30 minute catnaps, and there are always emergency
repairs, this time requiring her climb the mast to make
repairs the the mainsail.  Being bruised and battered a
world away from home out in the middle of nowhere is an
essential portion of most such voyages.

The BBC World News devoted just over 1/3 of their story
segments to covering the finish of this record breaking
story, but United States networks seemed to ignore this
story completely.

The media seems to be quite different these days from a
standpoint of biased reporting than it was in a variety
of previous incarnations during the 1900's and 1800's.

And, of course, let's not forget just how great stories
such as this one fly in the face of Harvard's President
only a week after he left the news with egg on his face
after commenting about women not being suited for study
or careers in the areas of science and mathematics that
are required to accomplish such a record breaking feat.
If you don't think applying science and math to sailing
around the world requires much study, then you have not
actually tried it, or else you are a natural math whiz.

We tend to forget that the rigors of navigation, even a
modern computer-aided navigation, are still well beyond
the capabilities of the normal math and science student
or professor, not to mention being able to calcuate the
winds, currents, location, weather reports, maps, reefs
and all the other naval navigation requirements.

This feat is truly one of the most difficult we hear on
the news as well as one of those requiring the greatest
possible endurance of mind and body working together.

Whether that mind and body are female or male. . . .


*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

I hope you saw The Daily Show's segment on the largest cache of
chemical weapons in the world. It's in a place called Al Abama.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

The results of the Iraqi elections will be held up for so long
that no one will care who was elected, or how many voted. . .
the fact that elections were held at all will called victory.

Of course, that victory will not encourage anyone to go home.



*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


We don't usually associate smog advisories with the
middle of winter, but there is just such an "air quality
alert" [to put it in NewSpeak] for a handful of counties
surrounding Terra Haute, Indiana, and apparently a few
more in northern Indiana.  [Terra Haute is south of
Indianapolis, not far from Illinois.]

!!! Well, I spoke a little too soon, only a day after
sending out this report we were under a "smog alert"
as they called it before the Political Correction
Officers insisted on a new NewSpeak Dictionary that
doesn't include "smog alert."  Yes, right here in
my Central Illinois hometown surrounded by cornfields
we are having our own smog alert, and people are being
warned not to go outside if they are old or have any
medical concerns about breathing.

Apparently lots of particles are in the atmosphere
from cars, factories, furnaces and the like; first
time we've had one of these new-fangled alerts, at
least according to the news.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
