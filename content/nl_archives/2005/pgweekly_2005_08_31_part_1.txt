***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

In the 34 weeks of this year, we have produced 2107 new eBooks.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

1.1 Trillion eBooks Given Away

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,463,640,998 that would be 17,063 x 64,636,410 = ~1.1 Trillion !!!
64,636,410
With 17,063 eBooks online as of August 31, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.91 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,636,410 x 17,063 x $.91 = ~$1 Trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 17,063 eBooks online as of August 31, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.59 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.73 when we had 13,677 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 17,063 eBooks in 34 Years and 01.80 Months We Averaged
      ~499 Per Year
        41.6 Per Month
         1.38 Per Day

At 2107 eBooks Done In The 238 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
    ~8.9 Per Day
     ~62 Per Week
    ~270 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

However, I just this moment heard a news item that made me wonder a
bit more about the accuracy of the U.S. Census.  A "Special Census"
is taking place in Normal, Illinois, that is expected to count more
people, by a factor of 3,000 or 3,400, depending on which source.

45,386 was the population as per the 2000 Census, so 3,000 added to
this would be an increase of 6.6%, and 3,400 would be 7.5%, above a
possibly automatic increase of 5% as per the same terms above but I
presume this is in addition to previous adjustments.

Of course, we should consider that we would have to double figures,
perhaps to 15% from those above, if are considering the normal time
between censuses of 10 years, these are for 5 years' growth.

In previous news I heard about the U.S. Census, no mention was made
about the annexation of various nearly locations as a cause of this
normally unexpected growth, but it is mentioned at the site I found
on the subject of the current Special Census.

If annexation is the primary cause of such increases, country wide,
then we should not be expecting a huge rise in the 2010 Census, but
rather should expect something more along the norm.  However, if it
is not annexation, but more actual people on the average, then this
might be an indicator that the population of the U.S. may have seen
300 million go by some time ago.

For more details, see:  www.normal.org/WhatsNew/Census.htm


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


COMPUTERS IN SCHOOLS, BUT NOT ALWAYS FOR TEACHING
A new study indicates that computer usage by U.S. schoolteachers is
rising, though technology is more frequently used for administrative
purposes than for teaching. The study, conducted by Scholastic
subsidiary Quality Education Data, found that 70 percent of teachers
communicate with parents using e-mail and that a majority use computers
for tasks such as attendance, according to CDW Government. Just 54
percent said they have incorporated technology into their teaching, and
more of those who use technology in teaching are at the elementary
level than in middle or high schools. Teaching with technology appears
to be correlated with training: 85 percent of respondents said they
have received training in applications such as the Internet, word
processing, and e-mail, while 27 percent said they have had little or
no instruction in how to include computers in their teaching.

FBI SEEKS LIBRARY RECORDS
According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the FBI is
using one of the powers granted by the USA PATRIOT Act to demand the
records of a library in Connecticut. Because the USA PATRIOT Act also
forbids disclosure of details surrounding such investigations, the name
of the library in question is being kept confidential, though it is
known to be a member of the American Library Association. At issue is
the authority to subpoena library records using something called a
national security letter, which does not require a judge's approval.
The ACLU has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of the library, saying
"it should not be forced to disclose such records without a showing of
compelling need and approval by a judge." Anthony D. Romero, executive
director of the ACLU, said, "This is a prime example of the government
using its Patriot Act powers without any judicial oversight to get
sensitive information on law-abiding Americans." The FBI did not
comment on the lawsuit, but the agency's national security letter
noted that it was seeking the library records as part of an
investigation "to protect against internal terrorism or clandestine
intelligence activities."

GOOGLE TALK PROVIDES VOICE, IM SERVICES
Google has announced a free service called Google Talk that lets e-mail
account holders talk to each other using a PC, microphone, and speakers
and provides instant messaging capability. Google reportedly plans to
make the service compatible with other companies' services, basing it
on an open standard, which would allow users to talk to people on
competing systems. Users will not be able to make calls to landlines or
mobile phones, however. The new service does not carry advertising, but
Google hopes it will encourage people to sign up for the Gmail service,
which does.

FCC PROPOSES USF TAX ON NET PHONE USERS
A Federal Communications Commission proposal released to public notice
by the FCC's federal-state joint board on universal service recommends
requiring more companies to pay taxes into the Universal Service Fund
(USF). The shift would mostly affect Internet telephone providers,
which don't currently pay into the fund. Internet-based services such
as chat and instant messaging that don't link to the public telephone
network would continue to be exempt from USF taxes, according to the
proposal. The USF subsidizes telephone services in rural and high-cost
areas, and companies that currently pay into the fund pass the costs on
to their customers.

HITACHI CLAIMS FIRST TERABYTE HARD DRIVE/DVD RECORDER

[And you heard it here, a week ago]

Hitachi claims to have developed the first hard disk drive and DVD
recorder that can store a terabyte of data or record about 128 hours of
high-definition digital broadcasts. The company hopes the new line will
make the money-losing DVD recorder part of its business into a profit
center by next year. The new line also includes models that can store
160, 250, and 500 gigabytes of data. Hitachi claimed the new models are
the first to have the capability of recording two high-definition
programs simultaneously. They go on sale in Japan in September. Plans
for overseas sales are not firm because of weak interest in high-end
recorders in European and U.S. markets, explained a company spokesman.

SONY PLAYSTATION PORTABLE GETS INTERNET BROWSER

[With a browser, can eBooks on PlayStations be far behind?]

Sony Computer Entertainment America announced plans to add Internet
access to its PlayStation Portable gaming device in an attempt to boost
the PSP's use as a handheld entertainment center. A software upgrade
enables wireless Internet access through a Web browser. The software
also boosts data security and enhances sharing of digital photos and
playback of video, according to Sony.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

More schools are switching over to eBooks.



*STRANGE WORDS OF THE WEEK
*DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK
[Combined this week, due to unprecedented events]

Former Governor John Rowland of Connecticut may actually be the
first person conviced under the "Revolving Door" law he signed
while still governor.  Currently he is serving time in Federal
Prison ["Club Fed"], but the Connecticut State's Attorney says
he intends to bring him back for trial in state court, and, if
convicted, to place him among the general prison population.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

John Rowland will NOT serve time in the general prison population.


*QUOTE OF THE WEEK

[Leaving this one in, as is relevant to the new SAT scores below]

US spending on tutors rose to $4 billion is 2004 from $3.4 billion in 2003.

[This is enough for 4 million families each to spend $1,000 per year,
just on extra tutoring to augment our failing classroom instruction.]

*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Yesterday the new SAT scores were released with a big hoopla,
touting that the US school system was finally improving:  but
the truth is that this year's scores are virtually identical,
and statistically indistinguishable from previous scores.

*

The nationwide average this year is 1,028, up two points from 2004.
520 for math was up 2, 510 for verbal was totally unchanged; scores
in general have risen 9 points since 2000, still less than 1% more,
and still less than it would take to make any conclusions, based on
statistical standards.

2 points out of ~1,000, and a possible score of 1600 isn't remotely
what these testing companies would/could/should call significant in
terms of their own statistical expertise.  The variances between an
SAT of one year and of another are much greater than 2 points, thus
the tests are likely to be changing more than actual performance by
the schools and/or the students.  It would be nice if we could test
the tests, and thus have some knowledge of our measuring stick.

Verbal scores dropped just below 500 in both 1991 and 1994, and the
scoring of the tests was soon revalued, as were the ACT scores when
they dropped to 90% of their original scores. Math scores had their
lowest point at 492 in 1980 and 1981.

We should also consider that most of the students who should not be
expected to do very well on such tests do not take them, either for
reasons of personal choice, where that is still an option, or based
on the fact that they simply are not continuing in school at all.

Thus we should be aware that the real national average would be all
that much lower if everyone were tested.

People ask me why I write something so negative about our students,
our schools, and our testing system, and the answer is that I would
not have to if the statements made about the various scores will be
made more accurately.  I didn't hear or read a single media comment
questionning whether the 2 point change was valid or reliable, in a
statistical sense.  What does this mean?  The next time you see all
the statistical polling done by the media, take a look at a corner,
and you will likely see a comment that the results of these surveys
are designed to be accurate within + or - 3%. . .that gives a range
of 6%, or what would be 60 points on a scale of about 1,000 points.
2 points just isn't enough to be statistically significant, even if
the SAT people did three times as well, and guaranteed their values
accurate to + or - 1%. . .which would still be a 20 point range the
values could fluctuate within before being even mininally mentioned
in a statistially relevant sense, and far from having significance.

*Just ask your local math teachers about statistical significance.*

You probably won't find 3% of these who would say 2 points in 1,000
has as much statistical relevance as a number of other factors in a
testing process such as the SAT, where just one question being just
slightly poorly written would throw off scores more than 2 points--
not to mention social changes, such as the fallout from 9/11 and an
assortment of other geopolitical events.

[Results of your survey as above should be accurate to + or - 3%.]

We should also keep in mind that the various college tests were not
using the same traditional scoring system recently, and in fact the
scoring systems have been altered more than once since the time our
own SAT and ACT scores were computed.  After each of these revalued
scorings the news media has been full of the "fact" that scores had
improved, without any mention that it was actually a change in what
we might call the measuring stick rather than in what we measured.

The SATs were "remodeled" in 1990, and "a new SAT was introduced in
1994, and in 1995 SAT scoring was recentered. . . ."     "Since the
adjustment, SAT averages have gone up."

[Quotes from:  iApply - Where do you go after high school?]

Recently this process has been renewed.


WARNING:


"Don't Confuse The Map With The Territory."


*

Another topic not mentioned was that a large percentage of students
take the tests more than once, and even more than twice, until they
feel they have reached a satisfactory score.


*

Here are some of the exact scores I have been able to find.  If you
can provide more, they would be greatly appreciated.  Supposedly an
ETS [Educational Testing Service?] bulletin is available with a new
complete history of SAT scores, but I haven't found one yet.

[I now have complete years from 1972-2001, would still like more!]


1980   Low point     Math 492
1981   Low point     Math 492

[Test "remodeled" in 1990

1991   Verbal  499   Low point
1994   Verbal  499   Low point

["New" test in 1994]
[Scoring "recentered" in 1995]

2000   Verbal  505   Math 514
2001   Verbal  506   Math 514

2004   Verbal  508   Math 518
2005   Verbal  508   Math 520

We should note that even from the lowest points to the highest,
even with all the "remodeling" and "recentering," that scores
have not gone up all that much.


*

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.

POEM OF THE WEEK

This is number five of a series of five poems from a volume named:

"Thoughts of My Exiled Self."

The motto for this poetry volume is,
"Upon this Word I shall build my life."


A Thought

To Nichita Stanescu, the poet

A thought exploded in me
saying that the dawn's cheeks blush
because they long for the night
and that the wave of the sea
is a restless traveler
who seeks pearls of words
among the empty shells

I am enslaved by this thought
with the crazy passion of the Moon
to embrace the Sun
and thus give birth to a new Universe
with no rules or regulations
just castles of sand that last
and boats carrying a fisherman
who can walk on the sea.
