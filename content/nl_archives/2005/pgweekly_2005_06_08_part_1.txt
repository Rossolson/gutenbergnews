HOT REQUESTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS


PROJECT GUTENBERG OF EUROPE TAKES OFF!!!


"EUROPE'S FLAMING JUNE 2005"

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE" STARTS REGULAR ACTIVITY

After a year of preparation "Project Gutenberg Europe", organized by
"Project Rastko Network" and its "Distributed Proofreaders Europe",
starts regular activity this month, now having now its own server
provided by leading South Eastern European provider "EUnet".

First 20 PD e-texts are already posted, as below, and some 80 could
follow by the end of the June. In coming days, special greetings,
essays and translation will be posted on title page of PGE,
as well as definitive tuning of the technical system will be over.

PGE and its branches operate under European copyright legislation
(life+50 and life+70).

It already has volunteers all over the continent: European Community,
Comonwealth of Independent States [ex-USSR] and other countries.

"Distributed Proofreaders Europe"--as central European PD digitizing system,
and only Unicode is capable of that kind in the world at the moment--releases
a multilingual "European Proofing Package" of books this month, as special
choices of general interest for whole continent.

Also, regional and national campaigns in European countries are scheduled
between May 31 and June 30, including first wave of physical events--
conferences and promotions--in Eastern Europe (Macedonia, Serbia,
Romania, Ukraine, Poland)

The international community gives enormous support to PGE, led by original
PG [U.S] and DP [U.S], as well as local open source, PD and Wikipedia
communities.  PGE also has  strong support by academic and professional
circles in many European countries.

Those of you with access to Charlie Rose can see/hear new commentaries
on this subject as per last Friday's show with Eric Schmidt of Google.

LOTS about cell access to the Internet.

Cellphone as PDA Redux:

Following up on several discussions concerning cell phones used as PDAs,
eBook readers, etc., it now appears that the major players realized this
is the new wave, as more and more of the major players, including Google,
have made their services available in cell phone formats.

Not to mention that he was very big on promoting automatic translation,
for those of you who interested in making eBooks in 100 languages.

*

In related news, something I have feared was going to happen:

The Digital Divide, Version 2.0  !!!

The New York Times has announced that there will be a $50 per year fee
to access their various editorials, articles, and services that have a
user base that was built up through free access.

*

Wanted:  People who are involved in conversations on Slashdot, Salon, etc.

users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Statistical Review

In the 22 weeks of this year, we have produced 1469 new eBooks.
It took us from 7/71 to 9/98 to produce our FIRST 1469 eBooks!!!

          That's 22 WEEKS as Compared to ~27 YEARS!!!

*

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 16,425 eBooks online as of June 08, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.94 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,465,195 x 16,425 x $.94 = ~$1 trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 16,425 eBooks online as of June 08, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.61 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.78 when we had 12,885 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 16,425 eBooks in 33 Years and 11.25 Months We Averaged
      ~484 Per Year
        40.3 Per Month
         1.33 Per Day

At 1469 eBooks Done In The 154 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      10 Per Day
      67 Per Week
     280 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

*Headline News from Edupage

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

SPAM FIGHTERS FORM NEW COALITION
A new group tentatively called the Anti-Spyware Coalition plans to
publish guidelines to define spyware, best practices for software
development, and a lexicon of common terms by the end of the summer.
The guidelines will be open to public comment. The Center for Democracy
and Technology, a public advocacy group based in Washington, is running
the new initiative. The coalition formed two months after the collapse
of the Consortium of Anti-Spyware Technology Vendors, which admitted a
company suspected of making adware. According to David Fewer, staff
counsel at the Ottawa-based Canadian Internet Policy and Public

APPLE TO SWITCH TO INTEL
Apple Computer reportedly plans to use Intel processors in Macintosh
computers, ending a multiyear relationship with IBM and Motorola.
Analysts speculate that a major factor behind the shift is the failure
of IBM to develop new Power PC chips that produce less heat. Low heat
generation is critical for notebook computers, which have less room for
heat-dissipating features than desktop systems. The move follows
Microsoft's decision to build its own computer hardware with
assistance from IBM--a shift from its previous Windows-Intel
alliance--and IBM's sale of its PC business to Lenovo. One key
challenge facing Apple is persuading software developers to rewrite
their code to work with Intel chips.

UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS DEVELOPING BROWSER TO FIGHT TERRORISM
Researchers at the University of Buffalo (UB) are developing browser
technology that endeavors to identify hidden connections in vast
collections of documents. Rather than simply looking for matches to
specified query terms, which is what typical search engines do, the UB
technology seeks to uncover connections between ideas. According to
John McCarthy, professor emeritus of computer science at Stanford
University, a tool that successfully links concepts could be an
important breakthrough. A number of federal agencies, including the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are investing in the research,
which they hope can be used to find the sorts of connections that will
aid efforts to fight terrorism. The project has been used to search the
report from the 9/11 Commission as well as public Web pages, looking
for connections regarding the hijackers. The tool searches for concepts
such as names, dates, and places and maps the connections it finds,
potentially resulting in trails of evidence useful to investigators or
other authorities.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

GM has "placed" this statistic all over the major media
for a few weeks now, presumably hoping people will feel
sorry for them, as per their high prices:

$1500 from every car sold goes to employee health cost,
and we heard it straight from the horses mouth in more
media coverage just yesterday.

However, GM made 5.2 million vehicles in North America
during 2004, and at $1500 each, that would have placed
$12.3 Billion into their health care plan while source
information from The Detroit News indicates only $5.6B.

"If General Motors was just selling a million more cars
per years, you wouldn't be hearing these complaints
about high health and pension costs."

Google claims to now be the largest media company,

at triple the original price at a total of ~$81 B,
thus surpassing AOL Time-Warner at ~78 B.

However, cash flow into the company was only $3.x B

AOL Time Warner at ~$42 B.

The Pentagon has apparently conspired to artificially

an effort to bail these parties out of trouble if not
out of jail.

Meanwhile, Airbus and Northrop have teamed up to make
an offer the Pentagon can't refuse under scrutiny.

*STRANGE WORDS OF THE WEEK


Republican Presidential Quotations

"Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment
insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of
that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group,
of course, that believes you can do these things. Among them are a few Texas
oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other
areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid."
President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1954

DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

The United Nations, for whom most of us have always had
the utmost respect, fell a number of rungs off a ladder
recently when it officially adopted "World Intellectual
Property Organization's" masthead as part of its own.

While the UN is famous for assisting those in need from
countries all over the world, WIPO is equally infamous,
for its hundreds of years of public domain repressions,
all the way back to the Gutenberg Press, when, under an
assortment of previous names, this organization felt it
would oppose any new technology that would/could/should
bring relatively unlimited information to the masses.

My own copyright situation reflects at least these five
copyright laws, each designed to eliminate competitions
from technologies that were capable of bringing as much
information to the masses as was available to the elite
only a few short years before.

1.  "The Statute of Mary" in 1557  Anti-Gutenberg Press
2.  The Statute of Anne in 1709    Anti-Gutenberg Press
3.  The US Copyright Act of 1909   Anti-Steam/Electric
4.  The US Copyright Act of 1976   Anti-Xerox Machines
5.  The US Copyright Act of 1998   Anti-Internet/Web

The first two laws were written and lobbied through The
Stationers' Guild, later The Stationers' Company, in an
obvious political power struggle that took generations,
but eventually, after 150 years of the Gutenberg Press,
the Stationers [scribes] got back their monopoly status
over all publishing under British law.

Of course, during that 150 years more books had already
been printed by the Gutenberg Presses than had been all
the previous years of hand-written history, and the die
had already been cast by Gutenberg for the upcoming new
Industrial Revolution, and thus there was no going back
to the previous feudal system of total guild monopolies
as had been written into these first two laws.

However, at least momentarily, the number of books made
available in the U.K. fell to ~600 after the Statute of
Anne from ~6,000 before the Statute of Anne; censorship
by the government and The Stationers was back, and in a
very big way.

The 14 year copyright with a possible 14 year extension
as stated in The Statute of Anne was adopted later from
British law to the laws of the revolutionary new places
created by the Americans and the French.  I should note
that the author still had to be alive for such extended
copyright periods in the original laws, and a copyright
belonged to the publisher, The Stationers' Company in a
first 14 year copyright period.  We should also note it
was written into the first of these five laws that such
copyrights would apply retroactively to every word ever
written, not matter by whom, or how long ago.

The original copyright law was designed to put all work
under copyright ownership by The Stationers Company.

This law was egocentric on the parts of The Stationers'
Guild members and it was held in such ill repute by all
concered that it was never enforced or obeyed, thus the
law was replaced by second, The Statute of Anne.  These
changes allowed for copyright only on new works and for
the second copyright period to be owned by the authors.
This was deemed a great victory by the authors, but the
reality was that The Stationers' Company were giving up
very little, as hardly any books were still in print in
the second 14 years of their existence, and not so many
authors were still alive 14 years after writing some of
the best sellers that were still in print.

However, not all countries were bound by these laws and
the total number of titles and copies continued in some
fashion or form around the world.

200 years after The Statute of Anne came the third law,
one that was again designed by the olde garde publisher
network to elimination competition from the new boyes.

At the end of the 19th Century, more steam and electric
press books were being published than anyone had seen--
again, more books than had ever been made before, again
the monopoly of the olde boye network was threatened.

What to do?

Simple!

Just do what ye olde boyes did to the Gutenberg Press.

Pass a law that wipes out the new competition.

Since the new boys WERE new, they didn't have contracts
to publish the new authors, so they reprinted all those
books over 28 years old and most books over 14 years as
90% of all copyrights were never renewed, so copyrights
were really mostly only for 14 years.

By placing one of these new steam or electric presses a
few feet from the new transcontinental railroad lines a
new boy publisher could fill an entire boxcar literally
overnight and have it shipped anywhere in the country a
few days later. . .and they did exactly that.

Combining these new technologies with new Rural Federal
Delivery mail system, Sears & Roebuck delivered a whole
768 page catalog to nearly everyone in the U.S., a feat
that would have been impossible earlier.

This made the other publishers sit up and take notice--
if Sears could do this inexpensively enough to send the
millions of catalogs all over the country, then any new
publisher could do the same, only sell the books at low
prices the olde boye networke couldn't compete with via
their now antiquated business plans.

Thus the U.S Copyright Act of 1909 was created with the
specific goal of wiping out all those new reprint house
publishers by making it illegal to reprint simply via a
new copyright law that voided the old one, and made the
new copyrights twice as long as the old ones.

This is why you can find so many collections of reprint
books dated around the turn of the 19th Century but the
number drops off precipitously after 1909.

Got competition?

Buy a law against it!

This was the third time such a stragegy was employed.

The fourth time was in 1976 when a similar law was made
to extend the maximum copyright term from 56 years as a
copyright had been since 1909, to 75 years, but perhaps
even more importantly, the requirement for copyright to
to be extended was eliminated, even though 90% of those
copyrights had never been extended before.

Thus this law was nine times more repressive than those
previous laws had been:  eliminating from public domain
access ALL books for 75 years, not just those books the
publishers could still make a profit on.

This is a great example of spite, where these publisher
refuse access to others even what they don't want to do
anything with themselves.

The true nature of copyright once again is revealed, an
act that keeps information from flowing to the public--
even when it is deemed worthless by the publishers.


But the story isn't quite over yet. . . .


"Power corrupts.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely."


Not satisfied with nearly complete control for 75 years
the publishers reacted in the same manner when Internet
access to public domain books became obvious to them in
the 1990's, and once again they extended copyrights, to
95 years this time, so that virtually no one could ever
be able to reprint anything that was published in their
lifetimes. . .thus cutting the umbilical cord between a
civilization and its past, except for what was deemed a
proper historical perpective by "in loco parentis," the
ugly heads of the three headed censorship again.


The end result was to change the public domain from the
50/50 proposition it was a century ago to the new world
order of 999/1 proposition of the new copyright laws.

That's right, by the time the first of the copyrights a
new world order created in 1998 expires, you will see a
copyrighted to public domain ratio that leaves you this
1 book out of 1,000 in the now endangered public domain
species that appears to be on the verge of extinction.

The publishers are not shy about saying they want a law
that specifies copyright should be permanent, that this
public domain that has long been the link between pasts
and futures of various societies throughout history, is
now targeted squarely in the crosshairs of the hunters,
and your access to information is the target.


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Eventually the cell phone will take over the functions of the
PDA [Personal Digital Assistants, such as Palm, Handspring, etc],
the PPC [Pocket Personal Computer, such as Sony, Compaq, etc.].

However, watch out for more per minute charges than you expect,
as some functions you think may be local to you may actually be
billed as if you were logged in for those minutes.

Google, Yahoo, ebooks, email, stock trading, movies, music, etc.,
are all now being tailor-made for cell phone use.

Believe it or not, even during a week in which three major bands
released a new CD, a ringtone beat out everything else in the UK
as the best seller in the music world, just this current week.

By the way, at the other end of the scale, have you noticed yet
how TV programs are being shot from wider and wider angles, for
the presumed purpose of forcing viewers to buy larger screens--
just so they can see the facial expressions they used to get in
the more close-up shots?

Not to mention the finer and finer print being displayed in the
corners and on the runners across the bottom of the screen.

Ever tried to read those on a 15" TV via normal broadcasting?

This is all part of the pressure tactics to force HDTV on us,
and watch for the government to step in and declare that your
old TV sets will no longer have any programs suitable to them.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Today there are 10 times as many commercials on television as
50 years ago. . .~20 minutes per hour compared with ~2 minutes.
In addition, you also hear 10 times as many "non-commercials"
on PBS and NPR.

By the way, this does NOT include those HUGE blocks of time
known as "infomercials" or "pledge drives" which are obviously
just about infinitely greater than 50 years ago when they had
little or no existence.

By the way, when I watch U.S. TV programs in other countries,
many of the commercial breaks are left out, since they don't
have nearly as many commericals, yet they still seem to make
plenty of money, just not by U.S. standards.

"It's all about the money."

"The first rule of reporting?  Follow the money."

However, under this model, it's not the upper class who pays.

*

The average of the pop stars on todays' Top 40 is 20 years old.

*

The average prescription drug costs twice as much in the U.S.

Medical costs are cited as the cause of more people going into
bankruptcy than any other cause in the U.S.

In Europe it is legal for companies to buy prescription drugs
in one country, relabel them, and resell them in another, all
the while under government supervision, just to save money on
personal prescriptions.  It is less efficient work-wise, but
it costs less cash-wise.

*

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.

POEM OF THE WEEK

city at dawn

queen of high heels goes to work
legs like those of svelte bridges
rivers of asphalt flow beneath
the chill mornings the flesh quivers
streets are red silky fashion caprices
everybody's watching life with desire
