HEADLINE NEWS!

THE MAGNA CARTA IS DEAD!  LONG LIVE ANTI-TERRORISM!

The Magna Carta, the foundation of democracy and human rights,
for about 800 years, and chosen as Project Gutenberg's 10,000th
eBook selection, has just been voided by Parliament in London.

Civil rights expressly granted now by over 100 governments around
the world have just now been overthrown by their founding country
in an election year bid by various parties and coalitions of the
U. K. Parliament, and many predict that such rights will now
continue to disappear in what is generally known as "domino effect."

Countries that previously condemed and outlawed such powers on
the general principles of freedom and democracy became terrorist
regimes by their own definitions after 9/11, and these practices
were finally ruled as illegal as a three judge panel had finally
ruled three months ago that that eight foreign terror suspects
has been illegally imprisoned in violation of human rights laws.

However, with a Parliamentary election expected in two months,
both the Conservative and Labour parties wanted to appear very
tough on terrorism, even to the point of being publicly chastised
for debasing the very foundations of their country to do so.

Britain's lower house passed just such a bill four times, and it
was defeated four times in the upper house in marathon sessions
that eventually lasted well over 24 hours.

However, in the end, when all was said and done, the civil rights
of humanity were dealt a severe blow by the very country who made
them in the Magna Carta nearly 800 years ago.

After years in prison without being charged, these eight are now
still under arrest, though now it is a "house arrest" under which
they are confined from 7PM to 7AM and report to the government any
time they enter or leave the house, even though they had already
been forced to wear electronic monitor tags that tell goverment
agents where they are at any given moment.

In addition, these eight are not allowed at any gatherings other
than standard prayers at their mosques, or to have any contact
with the outside world from home via cell phones, the Internet, etc.

No visitors are allowed other than lawyers, doctors, children, etc.,
other than someone providing goods or services.  Only one bank account
is allowed per person, to be severely monitored by the government.

Even the most staunch supporters of giving away the public's freedom
to do battle with terrorism fear that this is all just electioneering
on the parts of those passing this law, as it would appear prisoners
were being held without rights long before 9/11, just not with quite
so much publicity.  [The Irish Republicans, for example.]

There are serious questions as to how long such a law can remain in
existence in a democracy, and how long a democracy can remain under
such law.

This is one issue that is going to come back to haunt its authors.

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 15,767 eBooks online as of March 16, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.99 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,247,806 x 15,765 x $.99 = $1+ trillion

With 15,767 eBooks online as of March 16, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.63 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.84 when we had 11,912 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 15,767 eBooks in 33 Years and 08.50 Months We Averaged
      ~468 Per Year
        39.0 Per Month
         1.28 Per Day

At 811 eBooks Done In The 70 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      11.6 Per Day
      81 Per Week
     322 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was

CHICAGO LOOKS AT CITY-WIDE WI-FI
Officials in Chicago have authorized a study of the feasibility of a
city-wide wireless network, despite a bill in the state legislature
that would ban municipalities from acting as utilities for such
services. Reportedly at the urging of commercial broadband providers,
State Sen. Steven Rauschenberger introduced a bill that would forbid
cities from either offering broadband service or "reselling" such
service to a company that would then manage it. Alderman Edward Burke
said he would introduce legislation that would give the city the right
to install a broadband wireless network before the state could pass the
law that would prevent it. Christopher O'Brien, chief information
officer for Chicago, said a city-wide network would likely consist of
about 7,500 antennas on light poles and would cost more than $18
million. One option, said O'Brien, would be to enter into an agreement
with a company that would install and maintain the network and would
pay the city rent for the use of the light poles.

SCHOOLS CRITICIZED OVER REJECTION OF NOSY APPLICANTS
A number of business-school applicants who were rejected due to their
looking at university admissions records online without authorization
have spoken out against the universities' decision to exclude them.
Carnegie Mellon University, Harvard University, and MIT have rejected
the applications of 153 individuals who used a hacker's instructions
to try to find out if they had been accepted. Although some applicants
involved acknowledged that accessing the records was wrong, they
contended that the actions do not constitute hacking and that the
institutions have overreacted. One rejected applicant wrote a letter to
Harvard, admitting a "lapse in judgment" but noting that he "wasn't
trying to harm anyone and wasn't trying to get an advantage over
anyone." Len Metheny, CEO and president of ApplyYourself, the software
that all the affected schools used for applications, said the procedure
to access the records was sufficiently complicated that anyone doing so
would have to have known it was unauthorized.

APPLE WINS RIGHT TO SUBPOENA E-MAIL RECORDS

New iPod, etc., outed before official announcement]

A judge in California has ruled that Apple Computer has the right to
subpoena records of an e-mail provider to determine the source of leaks
of confidential company information on upcoming products. In his
ruling, Judge James P. Kleinberg was careful to sidestep the question
of protection for journalists and to note that his ruling does not
concern the merits of Apple's underlying case. Rather, he found that
under California law, the information published on Mac enthusiast sites
constitutes stolen property, as would physical property that had been
stolen. While the law does not allow prevention of such publications,
those responsible--regardless of the definition of "journalist"--must
bear the consequences of doing so, said Kleinberg. Apple hopes through
the proceedings to identify those individuals who leaked the
information that was posted on the enthusiast sites. The operators of
those sites are not the target of Apple's efforts. Kleinberg delayed
enforcement of his ruling for seven days to provide an opportunity for
the defendants to appeal.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


Malaria Drastically Underreported


It turns out that the media have been giving false reports
on malaria these past years, with half a billion people on
file as having malaria in 2002, but probably less than one
half that many were acknowledged.

The possible reason behind this is that most media outlets
are not particularly concerned with Africa, other than the
portion bordering the Middle Eastern oil/conflict region.

At least half of the world's malaria cases are located out
of the regions the media concentrates on, in a sub-Saharan
region of Africa.

However, about one quarter of malaria cases are located in
Asia and the Western Pacific.

And this is only counting the most deadly form of Malaria,
plasmodium falciparum malaria; 515 million cases per year.

As the World Wide Web brings us closer together, the media
can no longer continue to keep us apart.

*

In a related story, it would appear that "The Plague" your
history books mentioned in Europe, actually more like some
world series of plagues, conferred upon its survivors, and
their descendants, resistance to AIDS.

*

In yet another related story, having one gene for "sickle-
cell anemia" gives resistance to malaria, which explains a
confounding persistence of sickle-cell anemia in Africa.

FOUL UP CAUSES ANTHRAX SCARE, STOCK MARKET FALLS

[Official Pentagon Spokesman Remains Anonymous]

Apparently a test sample either was not cleaned out of
the anthrax testing machines or such a sample was placed
close or on the air filter from the Pentagon Remote Delivery
Facility to cause the recent anthrax scare this past week.

As a result, 100's of government employees were placed on
a three day regimen of antibiotics at an undisclosed cost
in terms of medical support, paid work leave, lost work, etc.,
not to mention the substantial loss to our finanical markets.

"Quality Control Problems" were officially announced as the
cause of the scare by a senior Pentagon official who has
insisted on remaining nameless.

*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK


"That which does not kill you makes you stronger."

That's why our cockroaches and rats are so tough.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Pharacological [drug] companies will spend well over half their
entire budgets this year on their marketing divisions and stock
dividends while only spending 3% on developing new drugs and 9%
on revamping old drugs to renew patents or to develop new drugs
that do not out perform old drugs.

Figures are from the US SEC [Securities Exchange Commission]



*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

A few years ago the average citizen of the world had not ever
made a single phone call.  Today even the average citizen of
Africa has made a phone call.  [Figures from Reuters]

*

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
