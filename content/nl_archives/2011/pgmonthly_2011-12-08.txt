This is the Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter for December 2011.

Well, we missed the November newsletter.  There has been an anomaly in
our connectivity to www.ibiblio.org, which hosts www.gutenberg.org.
This has prevented our updated offline catalog files, GUTINDEX.ALL and
others, from being posted in a timely fashion.  New eBooks are
still being posted daily -- you can see the RSS feed and other
listings of new eBooks at www.gutenberg.org

Project Gutenberg volunteer Larry Copenhaver creates the GUTINDEX*
offline catalog files, and we have some new, friendlier formats that
will be online over the next few days.  Stay tuned!

Below are extracts from GUTINDEX.ALL, listing our new titles for
October and November 2011 (through December 2).  As always, huge
THANKS go to the many volunteers who have helped to make these
eBooks possible!  In addition to these new titles, our errata team
has diligently gone over and REposted a number of earlier titles.

If you want to get involved in producing new Project Gutenberg
eBooks, the easiest way to get started is to visit Distributed
Proofreaders, at www.pgdp.net



GUTINDEX.2011 is a plain text listing of all the eBooks posted to the
Project Gutenberg collection between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011
with eBook numbers starting at 34807.
