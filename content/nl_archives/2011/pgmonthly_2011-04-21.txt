For those of you interested in the Canadian election in
a short while and in the copyright implications:


HOW CANADIANS CAN HELP THE FREE EBOOK
CAUSE DURING THE FEDERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN

By Mark Akrigg, Project Gutenberg Canada

BACKGROUND

The election is now less than two weeks away, and copyright
issues have been notable by their absence from the campaign.

This is partly because there is actually a large degree of
consensus between the political parties represented in the
Commons.

Part of this consensus is very good. For example, none of
these parties are in favour of increasing the general
Life+50 copyright duration -- this is a consensus that we
certainly share. And in fact we can congratulate the parties
on their policy.

Part of this consensus is not good at all, because it is a
consensus which the parties share, but not the public. Bill
C-32 in the last parliament proposed extensions to the
copyrights on certain photographs and audio recordings. And
I'm not aware that any of the opposition parties have spoken
out against them. This lack of discussion is shocking,
because we know (see further below) that the Canadian public
is absolutely opposed to copyright extensions.

So what we need to do is educate our politicians, so that
they learn that in the eyes of their constituents, giving
away part of the public domain is like selling off part of
Banff National Park.  We wish the political consequences of
damaging the Public Domain to be so enormous that no party
will consider it even for a moment.  By constantly
reinforcing this message, we make it more likely that no
further damage will be done to our beloved Public Domain.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

At election time it is easier to talk to politicians and
their supporters than at any other time of the year.  And it
is far more likely that phone calls and emails will be
answered.  I say this from experience.

Here are three points you might want to make when you speak
to a candidate or canvassers, or  when phoning a party's
office in your riding, or writing an email to this office
asking for clarification of a party's position.

(1) No copyright extensions. Not now, not ever!  (And free
trade agreements should be about free trade.  They shouldn't

be about other countries telling us that because their
governments have extended copyrights, the Canadian
government should take similar nonsensical action.)

(2) A "Safe Harbour" provision so that we can use works more
than 75 years old where the life dates of the authors are
not known.

(3) A resolution to the mess caused by the destruction of
the simple 50-year copyright rule for photographs the last
time the Copyright Act was revised in the late nineties.

If you would like background on these three points, have a
look at the submission I made on the last parliament's
copyright bill:

http://gutenberg.ca/documents/Mark_Akrigg_Bill_C-32_brief.pdf

Have a look as well at the submission by the Canadian
Council of Archives:

http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/copyright/BillC-32Brief_Jan
2010_CdnCouncillofArchives_EN.pdf

The CCA's submission mentions the question of special
penalties for bypassing Technical Protection Measures
(essentially, anticopying software). Bill C-32 proposed
making it illegal to bypass these locks. The opposition
parties wish to make it legal when the actual use made of
the copyright material is itself perfectly legal.

(It could be asked: why were digital locks mentioned at all?
Either something is legal, or it is not. What difference
does it make whether or not a digital lock is involved?)

Our viewpoints are those of the public. In the government's
2009 public Copyright Consultation, there were an astounding
5,520 submissions in favour of shorter copyright terms or
against extending copyright terms, and 5 submissions that
favoured extending copyright terms, or were opposed to
shortening them:

http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/4946/125/

The price of liberty continues to be eternal vigilance.

Thank you as always!

This Really Is "The Year of the eBook!!!"


More and more reports say eBooks are outpacing paper in
various retail markets and that doesn't even measure in
the free eBooks being handed out all over the world.

Project Gutenberg has reached the 100,000 eBook mark via
40,000+ internally created eBooks and 75,000 via donated
materials from other eLibraries, and subtracting ~15,000
to account for duplications.

It would take just under 1.5% of the world population to
receive the average one of these eBooks for Gutenberg to
have already given away TEN TRILLION eBOOK!!!!!!!

1.5% of the world population is over 100 million people.

100,000 eBooks times 100 million people is ten trillion.




20 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring
on December 21, 2012 [some now saying October 11, 2011]

Leaving 1 years 8 months, 6 2/3 seasons, or 20 months.
[OR Leaving 0 years, 6 months, 2 seasons. . ..]
[All bracketed figures minus 10 days, of course.]

Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions,
such as that there will be affordable petabytes [2021],
and enough eBooks to fill an entire petabyte around the
same time.  Current long range prediction for drives:
1 petabyte drives in 2025, possibly even in 2022, along
with 1 terabyte solid state drives [SSDs].  1 petabyte=
enough storage for every word ever published, 1 billion
books of 1 million characters each.

>From Apr. 21, 2011 to December 21, 2012 is 20 Months.

April 21, 2011 to October 11, 2011 is 6 Months -10 days.








VOLUNTEERS NEEDED OVER NEXT 3!!! MONTHS!!!


We need more volunteers for these projects with about 3
months to go before our 40th birthday. . . .

My own particular project is proofreading Alice to some
level of perfection and I'd love it if 100 people would
read Alice along with me in the next three months!

So far we have a couple proofreading Alice, and we need
some for Sherlock Holmes and for Pride and Prejudice.

So far we have one volunteer working on each of these.

We need some vol who can use COMP/DIFF related programs
such as WDIFF, etc., to note differences between eBooks.



Several Major New Projects Are In The Works. . . .


Right now looking for volunteers to fine tooth comb PG
eBooks of Alice In Wonderland, Through Looking-Glass &
Hunting Of The Snark for errors!!!  See #7 below.

Also during this last two weeks before the US election
is the last time for two years you can ask politicians
about their stance on copyright and possibly get a lot
more than either silence or "I don't know."



40th Year Special Projects!!!


We have several special projects we will be starting on
or around July 4, and if you have a project you like to
work on, why not send us a note and see if we can get a
team of volunteers to help.


Our newest project is to solicit suggestions where this
project should be in it's 50th year.  Suggestions are:

1.  Make it more obvious that PG wants error messages--
    how to write them, where to send them, etc.

2.  Make it more obvious that PG will send DVD's so the
    people who have to pay by the megabyte can use PG.

3.  An extensive library of human read audiobooks.

4.  Please make it more obvious how to do PG eBooks for
    Kindle, Sony, nook, and other eReaders.

5.  More current books under Creative Commons licenses.
    More apps for cellphones.  A model to encourage new
    writers to share their work in the same spirit.
    Showcase how people who used to be on the bad sides
    of various digital divides enjoyed and benefitted.

6.  Please add more bookshelves, particularly one to do
    eBooks from each country and make sure each one has
    at least one eBook to show how it can be done.

7.  Proofread the Top 100 or so downloaded books to the
    point where we they approach perfection.


So right now I'd like as many volunteers as possible to
let me know they would like like to proofread Top Tens.

More About Copyright Extensions


Pro-Active Information About New Copyright Extensions


As many of you know, just 5 years ago or so Australia's
Parliament voted a resolution to resist those copyright
extensions that had recently taken place in the US, EU,
and other locations, but only a few years later tumbled
into line after a few rounds of economic warfare levied
upon them by The Mouse or other long copyright holders.

Something on the same order appears to be happening for
copyrights in Canada, so please keep an eye out and let
us know what you see.

What many of you may not remember is how the copyrights
were extended in the U.S. in 1998 and 1976 without even
anything like the publicity in Australia or recently in
Canada where it appears they might be the first country
to actually resist such economic warfare efforts.

If you don't think this deserves the term "warfare" and
that it is really not such, perhaps you should consider
that the 1998 U.S. Copyright Act was passed at the same
time as President Clinton's impeachment bill was passed
and done behind closed doors in a "voice vote" where it
was not recorded who voted which way.

Many people have asked why President Clinton could have
been impeached when it would so obviously fail with far
more votes missing that would have made it interesting.

What they do NOT do is answer that question by listing,
even with just a short list, the other bills that their
special interests got passed, hidden behind smokescreen
politics created by the impeachment.

This is very powerful political maneuvering, and should
be brought to light, even if it cannot be stopped.

Perhaps there is time enough to shed light on these new
bills coming up to continue the ad infinitum extensions
of copyright that have changed the U.S. from having the
shortest copyright terms to having the longest in those
89 years from 1909 to 1998 when U.S. copyright extended
from 42 years maximum with rewnewals to 95 years and no
renewal required. . .even though 92% of all books would
never be renewed via the simple paperwork and the small
nominal fee that was required.

If nothing is done to dissuade Congress from doing this
The Supreme Court has already given them the power from
their point of view to extend as long as they want, and
that makes permanent copyright of Mickey Mouse a given,
and everything else of that era along with it including
Winnie The Pooh [1928 and 1926, respectively.]  The new
current U.S. copyrights already date back to 1923 so it
is obvious that Disney has the powerful vested interest
required to keep the lobbying pressure on Congress.

It should be noted that in The Supreme Court case lists
of Eldred v Ashcroft [originally set as Hart v Reno] it
was the Disney representative who got the best seats as
Eric Eldred was confined to the back row as Rosa Parks,
who won her case, and didn't have to sit in the back of
the bus, but had to sit in the back of the courtroom.

Hopefully there is time enough and interst enough to do
something to bring attention to this matter before vote
time for the next such copyright extension.

If they pass another such extension, the odds are we'll
have no more public domain books for Project Gutenberg.

[Apologies for any rough spots here, or not enough good
new materials, Greg and I have been on the road a week,
and are just getting back into the swing of things.]



More About The New Volunteer Support


In our 40th year of Project Gutenberg, we would like to
provide more alternatives for eBook production and also
for eBook distribution.

For added eBook production alternatives, we should also
need some decent supervisors to provide assistance to a
new type of volunteer group[s], as well as to insure an
eBook is quite readable upon release.

Obviously our distribution via our web sites or DVDs is
going to continue, and perhaps our volunteers will have
an interest in handing out DVDs, as well as pointing to
our various download sites.




Timeline Events


As you can see in our Grand Total figures below we have
just passed 40,000 titles this past month and will have
even more during our 40th year celebration, and 1,000 a
month over 40 years doesn't sound like much, but we are
on track right now to do around 4,000 this year.

We are currently giving away about 140,000 books a day,
just through the one single site:  http://gutenberg.org
~4.5 million eBooks per month or ~50 million per year!

In 2000 USB flash drives were just getting started with
8M "IBM Memory Sticks" available for about $60 and also
16M and 32M size were available.

Today 1,000 times as much memory, 8G, is available from
over the counter stores for about $15.



2020


We should all be considering getting petabytes if we do
have them already by then, and all of the findable book
titles that are public domain should have been put into
at least some eReadable formats, if not most or all.

It should be simple to hold each word ever published, a
billion books of a million pages each, uncompressed and
2.5 billion such titles, using compressed formats which
should be the default by then.

However, the rules will likely have been changed again,
and perhaps yet again, to stop the public domain and to
insure that copyright is more and permanent not so much
for the additional few percent in sales, but mostly for
the purpose of preserving and protecting:

"The Digital Divide."



New Project Gutenberg Web Pages


Please note TWO new Project Gutenberg web pages below--
new features, new search engines, etc.  Please test and
make comments, suggestions, etc.

We have yet another Project Gutenberg Web Page coming!

If you want free new places to put your eBooks just let
me know!!!

Will be at self.gutenberg.org




Request:

1894 Dr. Johnson Edition of:
The Complete Works of Shakespeare collection.
Missing volumes 2 & 6.  Got all the other volumes for a
couple dollars at a garage sale, but will pay 20 dollars
each for for volumes 2 & 6.





GENERATION CHANGE

I got a book this week called "Generation Change," that
lists "150 Ways We Can Change Ourselves, Our Country,
and Our World."  Most of these 150 items come with some
suggestion of sites to visit on the Internet.  #1 is:

PROJECT GUTENBERG!!!!!!!

"Generation Change" is available from:

http://www.skyhorsepublishing.com





Help create the  "http://m.gutenberg.org"  web pages!!!

We are working on making all our eBooks optimized to do
their best on iPads, iPhones, iPods, cellphones and PDA
devices, and to do our web pages to the same degree.

Let us know if you have any of these and can test them,
or would like to optimize for any other devices.

There are 4.5 billion such devices in the world, versus
only 1.15 billion computers, and more and more readers,
in spite of what the pundits say, are surfing, reading,
and everything else on such mobile devices.

More and more such devices will ONLY surf to "m" sites
such as "m.gutenberg.org"



In Our Own News Bin


New Project Gutenberg Web Pages


We have two new Project Gutenberg web sites up for testing.

I think you will find some interesting additional searching
and expanded lists of other eBook sites worth trying out:

http://gutenberg.trulymail.com


and another new effort at:


http://domainunltd.weebly.com/

Details:

The goal I'm aiming at with this initiative is twofold.

I'd like to provide as much useful information as possible
about e-books (freely) available on the web, where to find them.

And secondly, to offer people the opportunity to help out,
producing e-text for PG, in first instance by doing a first
round of proofreading on texts I deliver.

People who want to do more are welcome to and can count on help
in going through the process from start to finish.

Experienced proofers who enjoy working on a complete book
are also very welcome.

APPROACHING NEWS. . . .


ONGOING U.S. COPYRIGHT EXTENSIONS

U.S. COPYRIGHTS TO BE EXTENDED TO 115 YEARS,
DECADE BY DECADE FROM THE ORIGINAL 14 YEARS!

THE SUPREME COURT SAYS IT NEVER HAS TO STOP!!!

Suggestions are more than welcome how to publicize this
upcoming event before it even starts to happen!!!


Apparently everyone is keeping silent about the various
copyright extensions coming up in Canada and the U.S.

In just a few years yet another bill will be introduced
in the U.S. Congress to extend copyright that has quite
literally been extended from 14 years to 115 years.




Here's Why We Need To Start Before The Issue Arises!!!



When the last Australian Copyright Act was discussed in
Parliament, they passed a resolution stating they would
NOT extend copyrights.

Really.

However, just three years later, under economic warfare
from, shall we just say, outside sources, they crumbled
to the pressure and gave in.


The Canadian Parliament is currently in that position--
and while some tell me they have enough signatures from
those against any extensions, I will bet you lunch that
they, too, crumble before it is over.

I would gladly lose every one of those wagers!!!



Further Information


As you may already know, any time the copyrights in the
characters Winnie the Pooh [1926], or The Mouse [1928],
start coming close to expiration The U.S. Congress will
be sure to start a very quiet frenzy of copyright bills
that are designed to go into effect before anything can
happen to those two copyrights.

As I understand it, Disney(R) made a huge lobby effort,
successful, to create the 1976 U.S. Copyright Act; paid
as a result an additional $200 million for the right to
another 20 years of Winnie the Pooh, and still made the
fabled laughing trip to the bank as a result, since the
effective date of 1978.

As a result I have to imagine their sales of The Mouse,
Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, etc., must have been predicted
to be so terribly large as to devour Avatar's gross.

Given that next bill passed right in the middle of what
must have been the busiest day in Congress for the last
few decades, the impeachment of President Clinton, this
means we should expect something of equal secrecy quite
soon, as the current copyright extension runs out 2018.

Usually they would make an effort to pass the new one a
session or two early, such as in 2016, but given that a
snag or two has hit before, we should probably look out
starting in 2015, though it will be hard to see.

Why?

Even during the election just before the last extension
I went to ask televised press conference questions on a
new U.S. Copyright Act I had heard about, but candidate
responses were uniform. . ."I know nothing."

I would have to expect that even if the big anchors ask
the same question in 2015 they will get that answer.

Or non-answer.

>From what I have heard there is an ever larger movement
to keep everything copyrighted permanently, and to make
all media as pay-per-view as possible, to the points of
making all broadcast television pay-per-view on a first
viewing premise [except public stations].

We are very likely to see a dissolving out boundaries--
cable products showing up on network television and the
opposite direction as well.

What else CAN we expect when Comcast cable has been the
allowed buyer of NBC?

If you think programming won't leak over:

Consider what happened when Disney took over ABC.

Not only did Disney flood ABC with their own programmed
output, but they killed off the best of all cartoons.

Anyone remember Reboot?


I can put you in touch with many copyright experts, and
I fear that all of them underestimate the power working
to make copyright permanent, in spite of the fact words
"limited time" are the U.s. Constitution's description.

However, the U.s. Supreme Court decided that limited is
really unlimited in "Eldred v Ashcroft."

Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!



FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The ideal piece around which to center this collection is
one of the 8 megabyte USBs.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the
Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems
and these were OEMed by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular
in a recognizable fashion because their snapon connectors
resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

We received two examples of RAM actually labeled "Flash,"
for the H-P 95 pocket DOS machine from 1991, and a sample
of Fairchild bubble memory, as well, from down under.

Thank you, Mate!

As above:

Please note that the Project Gutenberg of Europe entries have
apparently all been fed to general Project Gutenberg counting
systems, though I was originally told they were not due to an
apparently different copyright system.  However I am told now
that they all were selected to work under US copyright.

I will continue to research this and make updates.

I think I made an error here, beyone the "off by 2" so if you
figure this out better, please let me know.

Right now I'm just taking people's word for all this and will
have to make future updates and announcements, but give these
weeks included the start of our 40th year, I wanted to made a
change at this time for recording purposes of this year.
