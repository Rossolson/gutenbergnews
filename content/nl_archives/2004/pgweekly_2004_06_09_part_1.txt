         An Interesting Story That Starts With eBooks

Prototyping: A Public Radio Commentary by Bill Hammack

When we think of the latest technological innovation
we usually think of how it affects the industrial western
world - but often it also affects all parts of the world.
Here's a story about its impact on the world's poor.

One day a young engineer named Saul Griffith tried to sell the
Minister of Education for Kenya a new "electronic book" that he'd
invented - a book that stored a complete library in it. The Kenyan
minister told Saul that at least a quarter of his people couldn't even
read the book because they had no glasses.

This sparked Griffith to tackle the problem of making glasses cheaply.
He learned that manufacturing glasses calls for special molds to make
the lenses and a laboratory in which to make them -- plus a doctor to
determine the prescription. In a nation like Kenya, or any rural area,
maintaining molds for the thousands of necessary lenses is costly.

Undaunted, Griffith set out to automate the prescribing and
manufacturing of a pair of glasses. He aimed for a cost of five
dollars a pair since 80% of the families in the world earn at least a
dollar a day. That way glasses would cost only a few days wages.

He designed a pair of goggles with an electronic sensor that monitors
the lens in the wearer's eye and adjusts the goggles's lenses to correct
the vision. This simple tool gave Griffith the correct prescription.

What Griffith then did with that prescription was truly revolutionary:
He built a machine to make the lens on the spot. In the last decade or so,
engineers have developed something called Rapid Prototyping Machines.
These machines can make a three-dimensional object by printing layers
of a thin plastic to build up a real object - not a photo, but the real
thing that you can hold in your hand. So, Griffith took the glasses
prescription and downloaded it to one of these machines, which are about
the size of desktop printer. It uses thin film, kind of like plastic wrap,
to make a lens mold, then injects it with hard plastic to make a lens.
In about five or ten minutes, out pops a complete and correct lens.
This kind of technology promises a revolution in our homes.

Already through the use of computers, we now "make" many things at home
that before we just could not. For example, we can "make" pictures from
our digital cameras, and even "make" movies with a digital camcorder
and a DVD burner. Now the next revolution of making things is just about
to hit. Perhaps in the near future, instead of waiting for a replacement
part for, say, a broken washer, we'll just download some info from the
internet and have our three-dimensional printer make the part.

[I would LOVE any more information relating to this story!]

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
an *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

Project Gutenberg--Canada is now starting up!!!

Please let us know if you would like to volunteer!
Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,
and we have volunteers working on both of these.
We will also be seeking volunteers from others of
the "life +50" countries, as it looks as if the
Australian copyright law is falling victim to the
new "Economic Warfare" being waged by the World
Intellectual Property Organization and various
billionaire copyright holders around the world.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 22 weeks of this year, we have produced 1978 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 1978 eBooks!!!

         That's 22 WEEKS as Compared to ~28 YEARS!!!


With 12,885 eBooks online as of June 09, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.78 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.23 when we had 7803 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine ~12,800 books each costing ~$.45 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~12,800 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 12,885 eBooks in 32 Years and 11.20 Months We Averaged
      391 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       32.4 Per Month
        1.06 Per Day

At 1978 eBooks Done In The 160 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
     12 Per Day
     90 Per Week
    380 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

NORTH KOREA RECALLS MOBILE PHONES

[Too Much Freedom Is A "Bad Thing {TM}"]

North Korea has recalled mobile phones from its citizens, nearly a year
and a half after the service was introduced in the communist country. A
North Korean official attending an inter-Korean economic meeting in
Pyongyang confirmed that mobile phones have been banned since May 25. (The
Age 4 Jun 2004) Rec'd from John Lamp, Deakin U.

[Yet Just the Opposite Policy is in Effect in China to Promote Growth]

EVERY FOURTH CHINESE TO HAVE CELL PHONE BY YEAR-END
One in four Chinese persons will have a mobile phone by the end of the year.
The Ministry of Information Industry predicts that by late 2004 24.5% of
the people, or about 320 million, will own a cellular phone. Cell phones
already account for about half of all operating revenue in China's
telecom industry, with short message and wireless Internet services
seen as important growth sectors. (The Age 7 Jun 2004)

[More on Strategies for Developing Countries]

SPECIAL SOFTWARE STRATEGIES FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
Departing from a one-size-fits-all global pricing strategy, Microsoft
has tailored special government-promoted PC sales for Thailand and Malaysia
in a new marketing approach for emerging markets. Localized versions of
Microsoft Windows XP are offered without English-language support, and the
company is apparently developing leaner Windows with features more
appropriate to developing countries. Microsoft executive Barry Goff says,
"This is a new market with very different needs, from an economic
perspective, from a social perspective, from a technical perspective." In
addition Microsoft, companies such as Symantec and Sun Microsystems have
also introduced special government pricing strategies for developing
countries. Jupiter Research industry analyst Joe Wilcox says, "What we're
seeing is the beginning of a trend. The more companies test the waters, the
more of a trend there is because of the competitive threat." (AP/San Jose

CAMERAS ON THE NET

[Big Brother is Watching YOU!]

Digital cameras with Internet protocol capabilities are functioning as
standalone servers that stream video over the Web. IMS Research predicts
that IP cameras will account for about 20% of a surveillance market in
Europe forecast to be worth $460 million in annual sales by 2008. Industry
analyst Simon Harris of IMS says, "It's going to be one of the biggest
trends in the surveillance market over the next few years without a doubt.
The companies that don't have good product offerings for network
surveillance are going to lose market share." (Reuters/USA Today 7 Jun 2004)

THIS IS YOUR LIFE, ONE MESSAGE AT A TIME
Many users of text messaging are unaware of the fact that their
messages are likely to be saved on servers. Telecom analyst Jeff Kagan says,
"One of the false assumptions that people make is that when they hit the
delete button, messages are gone forever, but nothing can be further from
the truth... It's just a common practice. I don't know an instance where
[messaging companies] delete them." Cell phone text messages seem likely to
be admitted as evidence in the current high-profile trial of basketball
player Kobe Bryant, in that the woman who made charges against him sent
several messages within hours of the alleged incident. Kagan warns
text-messaging enthusiasts: "I think in these days of corporate fraud and in
these days of terrorism we're seeing more and more reason to store forever.
Don't ever say anything on e-mail or text messaging that you don't want to
come back and bite you." (AP/Los Angeles Times 7 Jun 2004)

MICROSOFT WEIGHED MERGER WITH SAP

[Being the Biggest Means You Can Never Be Big Enough. . . .]

Microsoft explored the idea of merging with SAP, the German software
company, but ended negotiations with that company after weighing the
"complexity of the potential transaction." SAP, which makes business
software for large companies, is about one-fifth the size of Microsoft.
Industry analysts say that Microsoft's interest in SAP suggests that
Microsoft is restless with the slowing pace of the PC business, which it has
long dominated. Gartner technology analyst David M. Smith says: "It's no
surprise that Microsoft is looking for other acquisitions in the business
software applications industry. But the fact that Microsoft was talking to
SAP means they were going after the big kahuna." (New York Times 8 Jun 2004)

[More on Mega-Mergers]

ORACLE: 'PEOPLESOFT TAKEOVER WOULD INCREASE COMPETITION'
When companies merge, federal regulators always worry that the merger
will reduce competition -- and yet Oracle is claiming, paradoxically, that
its acquisition of PeopleSoft would actually do just the opposite: increase
competition. In an antitrust case against the company, the government is
taking the position that just three companies -- Oracle, PeopleSoft and SAP
-- have cornered the market for the complex software systems used on large
corporate computers, whereas Oracle is claiming that Microsoft's interest in
SAP (see above) shows that Microsoft wants a bigger piece of the $20-25
billion business applications software market, and that the competitive move
by Microsoft was actually prompted by Oracle's plan to acquire PeopleSoft.

MICROSOFT TO APPEAL EU ANTITRUST DECISION
Microsoft has filed an appeal of the European Union's antitrust
decision requiring the company to change business practices deemed
detrimental to competition. Microsoft says that to follow the EU's ruling
would undermine global innovation: "We believe that the interest of
consumers and other European companies should be at the heart of this case.
The Commission's decision undermines the innovative efforts of successful
companies" -- and would "significantly alter incentives for research and
development that are important to global economic growth." EU Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti says he's confident that the Microsoft appeal will
fail. (AP/USA Today 8 Jun 2004)

ACADEMIC PUBLISHER PURSUES OPEN ACCESS
Academic publisher Reed Elsevier has announced it will begin allowing a
version of open access publishing. Acknowledging ongoing demand from
academics for a less restrictive model for publishing scholarly work,
Reed Elsevier will allow authors whose work has been accepted for
publication to post articles on their own Web sites or those of their
institutions. As standard practices for academic publishing have been
challenged by new media and means of distribution, Reed Elsevier has
come under increasing pressure to adapt its practices and move away
from the traditional subscription model, as a number of other academic
publishers have done. Still, the company's announcement did not
convince some critics. Deborah Cockerill of competitor BioMed Central
said Reed Elsevier's approach to open access publishing is based on
controlling access and retains so many restrictions as to pose no real
threat to the subscription model. On the other hand, Stevan Harnad,
professor at the University of Southampton and a strong supporter of
open access, commended Reed Elsevier for its change, saying that
"the full benefits of open access require not one bit more [from
Reed Elsevier]."

SUN TO RELEASE SOLARIS CODE
In a surprise announcement, Sun Microsystems has said it will release
the source code for its Solaris operating system under an open-source
license. Sun formerly controlled a significant portion of the server
market with its proprietary Solaris operating system, but the company
has been losing ground in recent years to products from Linux and
Microsoft, which can be much less expensive than Sun's offerings.
Sun's announcement did not include specifics about its plan but said
that the company "is in the process of soliciting customer feedback in
refining various aspects of the project." Analysts said the
significance of Sun's new stance will depend on the particulars, such
as whether all or just part of the source code will be available. "This
is not the manifestation of a grand plan," said Ashok Kumar, an analyst
at Raymond James and Company. "There are more questions than answers at
this point."

ITUNES GOING TO EUROPE
Apple Computer is expected on June 15 to announce the release of the
European version of its iTunes music service. Observers expect the
service to be available at the time of the announcement. Details have
yet to be revealed, but analysts expect Apple to do well in the very
competitive European online music market, which already has several
established companies including Napster and OD2. Sales of Apple's
iPod, the only portable player that can play iTunes songs, have been
very strong, with total sales expected to reach 4 million, according to
Simon Dyson of London-based Informa Media. Apple introduced the iTunes
service in the less-competitive U.S. market last year and has sold more
than 70 million songs, including more than 3.3 million in one week.

More Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media

Juan Catalan had spent 5 1/2 months in jail on murder charges
by the time the wheels of justice finally got into gear and
finally watched HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" which had been taping
the baseball game Juan had been at only minutes before the murder.

Juan still had his ticket stubs to the game, which he attended
with his 6 year old daughter, along with family members' testimony
as to his whereabouts the night of the murder, but this was ignored
by the police and district attorneys who claimed to have a witness
who placed Juan at the murder scene.  His request to take the lie
detector test was also ignored.  Additional cell phone evidence
that placed Juan in the stadium area about 20 minutes before the
murder had also been ignored.

Mr. Catalan, who could have faced the death penalty, has sued
the city of Los Angeles for misconduct, false imprisonment,
and defamation of character.

After 5 1/2 months in jail, a judge finally ruled that the
police and district attorneys had never had any evidence.

The University of Illinois, after spending the better part
of a million dollars lost its Illinois Appeals Court case
for violating the free speech rights of its faculty, staff
and student body when the university ordered them to stop
telling prospective faculty, athletes and others not to
come to the University of Illinois due to prevalent racism
as demonstrated by their Indian mascot, Chief Illiniwek.

The legal fees reported were only the external fees paid
to lawyers outside the university, the internal costs in
the case were not made public.

This money, if applied to eduction, could have put as many
as 50 more students through the university during the same
period from 2001 to 2004.
