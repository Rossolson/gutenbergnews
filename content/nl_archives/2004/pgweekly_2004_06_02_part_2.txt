.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

  http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the world,
and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on the search
results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest
to you, visit:

  http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

EBooks numbered 1 to 10000 are located in "release year" directories.
Over time, the "release year" advanced, so that by November 2003 the
release year was 2006.  Starting with eBook #10001, they are filed by
their official eBook number, with a unique subdirectory based on that
eBook number.

FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000

To get to a directory listing you can use either:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/

Then navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the
appropriate level, and then select the file you wish to download,
using your usual download procedures.  This system works on mirrors,
too, and will hold all eBooks starting with the number "1" for
10,000 and beyond.


FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000:

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download site
(or a mirror) if you know the filename and year you want.  For example,
navigate to either:

  http://gutenberg.net/etext06/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/

and then look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that
updated eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99,
etext00, etc.)

CONVERTING OLD EBOOKS TO THE NEW FILENAMING AND DIRECTORY SYSTEM:

As of 18 May 04, Project Gutenberg volunteers began the process of
manually transferring the eBooks with numbers between 1 and 10000 to the
new directory structure.  This means that the files which were
previously posted in etext dirs based on their "official release year"
are now being posted in directories based on their filename.

This process includes, where possible and practicable, repairing,
correcting, and re-formatting to current PG standards, and in the
beginning stages will be very slow.  Place-holder files are being inserted
in the original file locations, directing user's to the new location.  The
pointers on the PG search page are being updated as changes are made.

It should be noted that one of the primary benefits of the new file
system is that HTML files, especially illustrated HTML files, can now be
viewed directly online rather than having to be downloaded.

During the past week we did not process any new ebooks per the above, but
are including this message for information purposes.


.:: Please note the following changes, corrections and improvements:

The following is being re-indexed to correct the title ("Nibelungenlied",
not "Nibelungendlied"):
Jan 2005 Nibelungenlied, trans. by George Henry Needler    [niebnxxx.xxx] 7321

The following has been re-posted in HTML format:
Dec 2005 The Little Colonel, by Anne Fellows Johnston      [tlcolxxx.xxx] 9407

=============================================================================

David Price, in "Cloudy England", sends along these notes about #12458
"The Talisman":

For those wishing to know: George Borrow, English traveller and polyglot
had been sent to Russia ("I possess some acquaintance with the Russian")
by the British Bible Society in order to supervise the production of a
Manchu (Chinese, he'd learnt that a few months before) Bible.  The Talisman
is one of the two books he produced (and printed) whilst in Russia.  It's
very short - just five translations of Russian poems.  George wasn't a
good poet but what they lack in polish they make up for in spirit.  The
book's important because of its place in George's life - rather than its
content.

This book is extremely rare - even in reprints.  My own copy is a reprint
of 1913, part of a small print run.  It cost me very serious money!

Those wishing to know more of George and his strange life can read all
about it in Herbert Jenkins' "The Life of George Borrow" - eText 3481.

. . .

Later, when it was just "Overcast England", he sent along this brief note
about #12485 "The Three Brides", by Charlotte M. Yonge:

For those wishing to know: Mrs. Charnock Poynsett, a rich widow, has four sons.
For reasons unknown three get married at the same time, and bring their
wives back to the family home.  The story follows the brothers, wives, Mrs.
Poynsett and various other characters as the situation works itself out.

. . .

And the irrepressible Jim Tinsely, regarding eBook #12461, "Castles in
the Air", by Baroness Emmuska Orczy, commented thusly:

Seven stories about an amiable rogue whose schemes never turn out quite as
he expects.
. . .

Your whimsical editor would like to recommend #12474, "Write It Right",
by Ambrose Bierce; subtitled "A Little Blacklist of Literary Faults".
Possibly parts are a tad bit out of date, but still worth perusing and
considering, and, if nothing else, the pithy passages therein will be
entertaining.

. . .
