We are in the process of rewriting some of the general FAQs and
would appreciate help proofreading them over the next few months.

We've added some new FAQs and generally updated information
about Project Gutenberg.  Take a look, and email Michael or
Greg with any suggestions or corrections.  We'll have these
updated from time to time, now that we've passed #10,000.
A new set of these will be in the works when we pass #20,000.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
and *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

   ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/images

***

_I_ am still interested in a DVD that has an actual total
of 10,000 eBooks. . .or more. . .mostly for PR purposes--
if someone would be willing to make one.


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have
regular needs for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby <gbnewby AT pglaf.org> ,
if you can help.

This is much more important than many of us realize!

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 31 weeks of this year, we have produced 2577 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 2577 eBooks!!!

          That's 31 WEEKS as Compared to ~30 YEARS!!!


With 13,484 eBooks online as of August 11, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.74 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.12 when we had 8861 eBooks a year Ago

Can you imagine ~13,484 books each costing ~$.38 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~13,484 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 13,484 eBooks in 33 Years and 01.25 Months We Averaged
       407 Per Year   [We do nearly that much a month these days!]
        34.0 Per Month
         1.12 Per Day

At 2577 eBooks Done In The 223 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      12 Per Day
      83 Per Week
     369 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

                   2602 New eBooks So Far in 2004

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


>From NewsScan:

[In two somewhat related stories this week, the U.S. goverment
refuses to give equal protection on wired and wireless phones.]


FCC SUPPORTS CALEA FOR INTERNET PHONE CARRIERS

[They don't want to stop tapping your wireless phones without warrants.]

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) responded to
law-enforcement concerns by suggesting that Internet-based telephone
services should be subject to laws that permit the government to
monitor landline telephone conversations. Discussion of the proposed
rule was the first formal step by the FCC to hold Internet phone
carriers to the same requirements as traditional phone companies, as
specified in the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
(CALEA). Industry executives who have supported law-enforcement efforts
nonetheless fear the new rules could be too expensive and too difficult
to apply to Internet phone services without impeding technological progress.

FCC MOVES TO PROTECT WIRELESS DEVICES FROM SPAM

[So Why Can't They Do This For The Internet???]

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is issuing new rules
prohibiting marketers from sending commercial electronic messages to
wireless technology users who haven't given them explicit permission to do
so. The agency is also urging the industry to develop technologies to
prevent spam from overwhelming wireless devices the way it now bedevils the
Internet. FCC chairman Michael K. Powell says, "By prohibiting all
commercial messages to wireless phones and PDAs absent affirmative consent
from the consumer, Americans can now use their wireless devices freely,
without being bothered by unwanted and annoying messages."

FCC RULES TO STOP SPAM ON CELL PHONES, PDAS
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued rules requiring
marketers to obtain explicit permission from wireless-device users
before sending commercial e-mail. The rule is an attempt to prevent
cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) from becoming
subject to massive e-mail spam. The FCC also urged the industry to
develop technologies to prevent spam. The rule does not apply to services
that forward existing computer e-mail messages to wireless devices or
permit the devices to connect to a computer-based mail account.

U.S. TO IMPLANT ID TAGS IN PASSPORTS
The U.S. State Department plans to implant electronic ID chips in U.S.
passports to allow computer face-recognition systems to match facial
characteristics of the digital passport photo on the chip against a
photo taken at the passport control station and against photos on
government watch lists. The change is planned despite warnings that
face-recognition technology has a high error rate. Critics suggest
using fingerprint identification instead, as a more reliable
technology. The new passports are scheduled to enter use in 2005.

[and yet more on this stuff]

U.K. PROHIBITS SMILING FACES ON PASSPORTS
The U.K. Home Office ruled that all new passport photos must show an
unsmiling face with closed mouth because open mouths can confuse facial
recognition systems. The new guidelines require good contrast between
the face and background; the full face looking straight at the camera;
no shadows; and a neutral facial expression. The rules will apply
immediately to new and replacement passports.

DECLINING NUMBERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS
The Computing Research Association says that the number of newly declared
computer science and computer engineering majors in the U.S. and Canada
fell last year 23% from the year before. The explanation is fairly straight-
forward: since the dot-com bust a computer science degree no longer
seems the key to instant riches. But Peter Lee, an associate dean of
computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, is unworried by the falloff
in applications: he thinks today's students are often of higher quality,
because they're motivated not by money but by love of technology.

THE UTILITY OF HIGH-SPEED ACCESS
In some U.S. public housing developments residents can tap into shared
broadband networks for less than $15 a month -- much less than the cost of
individual high-speed accounts. According to Rey Ramsey, CEO of the
nonprofit One Economy Corp. in Philadelphia, "the real issue was trying to
get access in the home where it's convenient. If the library or learning
center closes at 6 and you don't get off work until 8, that's not real
access." Robert Wendel, a former Cisco engineer working to provide access to
housing complexes, points out: "In the early days, a lot of low-income
housing didn't have washer-dryer hookups, either"; he predicts: "Eventually,
all new houses will be wired this way." (Washington Post 8 Aug 2004)

APPLE ACCUSED IN FRANCE OF UNFAIR PLAY
Online music retailer Virgin Mega has lodged a complaint with the
French Competition Council charging that Apple Computer has "wrongfully
refused" to license its Fairplay copy-protection technology and open up the
iPod portable music player to rivals. Apple uses to the Fairplay technology
to prevent unlimited copying of songs and to restrict other online music
providers from making their secure song files transferrable to the iPod.

SONY VS. APPLE, TRA-LA, TRA-LA
Sony, the electronics giant that developed the legendary Walkman
personal stereo, is launching a new version meant to capture the Apple's
iPod's current position as today's leading digital music player. Called the
Network Walkman NW-HD1, the device uses a proprietary file format, works
only on a Windows PC, and will cost $100 more than an iPod when it's
released later this month. Technology analyst Matthew Fordahl of the
Associated Press says the Sony's software doesn't rise to the level of the
hardware and adds, "Sony's format does produce good sound quality while
taking up less space, but users aren't given a choice. What happens if the
unique ATRAC format is abandoned? Just ask anyone who bought a technically
superior Betamax VCR instead of a VHS model." (AP/USA Today 5 Aug 2004)

WINDOWS ON A BUDGET

[The quote at the bottom of this one is a riot!]

Microsoft has created less-expensive versions of its Windows XP
operating system to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, and is developing
similar programs in two other countries. The widespread interest in the
Linux operating system has helped focus Microsoft's attention on the need
for seriously competitive pricing strategies throughout the world. Deepak
Phatak, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, says that India
is exploring programs to distribute low-cost PCs using Linux but that it
could be tempted by lower new prices from Microsoft:
"People in the government will never play a technology-favorites game.
They want to see value for money." (Wall Street Journal 11 Aug 2004)

IBM DONATES SOFTWARE TO OPEN-SOURCE GROUP
IBM will provide more than half a million lines of its software code
for the Cloudscape database to open-source software group the Apache
Software Foundation. The company's goal reportedly is to make it
easier for software developers to write applications in the Java
programming language. IBM is a leading supporter of Java, originally
developed by Sun Microsystems. The IBM software platform WebSphere runs
and manages such Java-based applications, competing with Microsoft's
Net platform, written in C++.

NUMBER OF COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS FALLS
Despite the improving outlook for the high-tech sector of the economy,
enrollment in most computer science programs at U.S. institutions
continues to decline, causing some to worry about the possibility of a
high-tech workforce shortage in coming years. Schools such as San Jose
State University, the University of Texas at Austin, and Ohio State
University have seen lower computer science enrollments, and according
to the Computing Research Association, enrollment is down by 23 percent
in the United States and Canada. Peter Lee of Carnegie Mellon pointed
out, however, that far fewer applications were received this year
versus last for his institution's computer science program but that
they were generally from more qualified applicants. No longer are
students applying, said Lee, because they are simply lured by the
prospect of high-paying jobs and stock options. Others noted that
enrollments in graduate computer science programs, which remain strong,
may soon begin to suffer due to increased restrictions on foreign
students, who represent 43 percent of students in graduate computer
science programs in the United States and Canada.

STEALTH WALLPAPER PROTECTS WI-FI NETWORKS
British firm BAE Systems has developed a type of wallpaper that
prevents stealth users from connecting to a company's unprotected
Wi-Fi network while still allowing cell phones and other desirable
signals to pass through. Wi-Fi networks are a boon to companies that
want to set up inexpensive wireless access within their buildings, but
many such networks are installed without adequate security to prevent
roaming hackers from easily connecting to networks and gaining access
behind a company's firewall. BAE's wallpaper is made from a sheet of
kapton plastic with copper on both sides in patterns of crosses. The
particular placement of the copper crosses determines which frequencies
are able to pass through and which are blocked. The company is working
on a transparent version of the technology to be used on windows.

More Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media

ODD GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS OF THE WEEK


ALA WELCOMES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DECISION TO RESCIND DESTRUCTION REQUEST

WASHINGTON, DC - The American Library Association (ALA) today welcomed the
Department of Justice's decision to rescind its request that the Government
Printing Office Superintendent of Documents instruct depository libraries to
destroy all copies of five Department of Justice publications addressing
forfeiture.   The Justice Department claimed that the documents are
"training materials and other materials that the Department of Justice staff
did not feel were appropriate for external use." ALA disagreed with this
categorization of the public documents, two of which are texts of federal
statutes, and with the instruction to destroy them. ALA trusts that there
will be no repetition of such unjustified instructions to destroy government
information...as below:

"The office's one-paragraph directive listed the five pamphlets, with
titles such as "Civil and Criminal Forfeiture Procedure" and "Select
Federal Assets Forfeiture Statutes," and instructed librarians to
"withdraw these materials immediately and destroy all copies by any means
to prevent disclosure of their content," according to a copy of the e-mail
sent to the Boston Public Library and all other depository libraries.
[Which would have limited access to this information to lawyers.
Apparently they didn't want the public to know just what rights did and
did not exist during federal forfeiture cases.]

"Calls to the Government Printing Office seeking comment were not returned."

estroy_us_pamphlets/

On a more local note, our county just instituted a tax on cats,
which requires registration, shots, etc., and limits household
animals to three [some of this is word of mouth, and I'm not
sure if it counts animals that live in cages, such as birds,
gerbils, hamsters, etc.]

*

And with national ramifications:

"The Republicans will have to go to a federal judge and get a
declaratory judgment to get Bush on the ballot," said Kris Kray,
the official legislative liaison for the Illinois election board,
answering questions about the Republican policy of having their
convention unusually late to allow for more fundraising time.
When the Democrats announced they were also considering having
their convention late the Republicans complained furiously,
stating it was simply for political fundraising purposes.

There were similar problems in several states.

*

Not quite on the level of odd govermental regulations,
but the Washington Press Corps, in a city that is has
twice as many blacks as whites, is perhaps the most
segregated major institution in the country.  Hardly
any black or Latino reporters get to interview candidates.

District of Columbia statistics:

Black: 343,312 (60.0%)
White: 176,101 (30.8%)

2000 Census population: 572,059

[Prompted by several mentions of this outside our major
media covering the U.S. national political conventions.]


SIMPLE SOLUTION OF THE WEEK

Convicted criminals must repay for the their own crimes, along with
those of all the unconvicted criminals, thus making the convicted
pay for the unconvicted and saving all government judicial expense,
since they have to pay for court costs, as well.  Perhaps even make
them pay for the salaries of the police.

Thus crime will become a "zero sum game" for the criminals, as well
as for everyone else.

ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

The current head of OPEC [the Organization of Petroleum EXPORTing
Countries] is Indonesia, which is a net oil IMPORTing country now.

*

It costs $67 per day to keep a person in jail.

The U.S. has the highest percentage of it's population in jail,
or on parole or probation.

The U.S. and nearly every one of the individual states, spend
more money on prisons than on education, and the prison budget
continues to increase while educations budgets fall behind.

It costs only about 10% as much to keep them on an "RFID" leash
working from a GPS that keeps track of where they are and warns
if they enter "forbidden zones."

*

According to 60 Minutes, 80% of all counterfeit products are made
in China, where perhap 15-20% of brand name products are knockoffs.
[When I lived near China, you couldn't buy ANY products I know of
that were not copies, and there was no effort to disguise copying.
This also happens in other Third World countries, but not to the
same extent, or so rapidly.  Around the Pacific Rim products are
usually available as counterfeits within a week of release.  The
prices are usually $1 for music [price hasn't changed in decades,
it's just a nominal price] and sometimes under 10% of the face
value of the real products.]

*

Another note on China:  Local residents say that when everyone
was poor, nearly everyone was honest, but the addition of money
has created an ethical situation of "Man eat man."
[Warning:  After keeping notes on China's industrial revolution
for quite some time, I found it odd to find several reports of
this sort of negativity release at the same time.]

*

A note on statistics in general:  I have noticed, even in years
without major elections, that a huge amount of the "information"
we received from Dan Rather, Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw is a
direct quotation from press releases, much of which are provided
by politicians to support their own positions.

*

One more note, I have spent a great deal of time studying how to
see through this kind of statistical manipulation.

ODD QUOTATION OF THE WEEK

Hummer vs. Hybrid debate
[Relayed from the BBC]

"The government credits you up to $100,000 in taxes for vehicles
weighing over 6000 lbs?  Versus $1,500 for hybrids?"

[BTW, many of these news stories come to us from overseas,
as our local media mostly refuses to deal with them at all.]
