*The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, June 16, 2004 PT1*
*****eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since July 4, 1971******

Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com

Email address is changing:  hart@pobox.com will still work, but the backup
address for when pobox.com is down will soon be hart@pglaf.org   The older
hart@beryl.ils.unc edu will probably still work but may be slower.  During
emergencies hart@metalab.unc.edu or hart@login.ibiblio.org should work, as
that is still my emergency backup email location.    Thanks!!!  Michael

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
an *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

Project Gutenberg--Canada is now starting up!!!

Please let us know if you would like to volunteer!
Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,
and we have volunteers working on both of these.
We will also be seeking volunteers from others of
the "life +50" countries, as it looks as if the
Australian copyright law is falling victim to the
new "Economic Warfare" being waged by the World
Intellectual Property Organization and various
billionaire copyright holders around the world.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 23 weeks of this year, we have produced 2043 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 2043 eBooks!!!

          That's 23 WEEKS as Compared to ~29 YEARS!!!


With 12,950 eBooks online as of June 16, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.77 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.22 when we had 8221 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine ~12,950 books each costing ~$.45 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~12,950 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 12,950 eBooks in 32 Years and 11.40 Months We Averaged
       393 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
        32.7 Per Month
         1.07 Per Day

At 2043 eBooks Done In The 167 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      12 Per Day
      86 Per Week
     376 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

BELLS ACHIEVE VICTORY OVER LONG-DISTANCE CARRIERS

[Higher local phone bills are on the way, say other media outlets]

The Justice Department has decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court a lower
court's rejection of federal rules requiring regional phone companies to lease
their networks to rivals at reduced fees. The decision is serious setback
to long-distance companies such as AT&T and MCI, which used the regulations
to launch their own brands of local service. But it is of course being
cheered by the regional Bell companies, which say that the prices imposed
by the rules forced them to subsidize their competitors with deep discounts.

OHIO CITY CREATES ONLINE SCHOOL IN FIGHT TO RETAIN STUDENTS
Hoping to retain hundreds of students it might lose to charter schools
next year, the city school district of Columbus, Ohio is planning an online
high school to compete with Internet charter schools, which have already
weened more than 1,000 students away from the city's public schools.
Columbus's new school will serve about 125 students starting in September,
and four community centers around the city will provide in-person tutoring
and computers for students who don't have online access at home.

'THE FUTURE OF TELEVISION': TIVO TO ADD INTERNET TO TV WATCHING
TiVo has developed a capability that will let a user download movies
and music from the Internet to the TiVo hard drive and mix it with TV
programs. TiVo chief executive Michael Ramsey explains, "We're fully committed
to developing an entertainment experience you can't get over normal broadcast television.
This is what we think the future of television is."

GOOGLE PROMOTES FROOGLE, IS ANYONE SURPRISED?
Google's shopping site, called Froogle, now appears at the top of the
list of advertiser-supported sites relevant to a particular search. Danny
Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Watch, complains: "It is weird when Google
shoves its own stuff in there. It is wrong, in that Google has taken a spot
an advertiser was expecting to get. If you are an advertiser, you have a
right to be upset. They ought to come up with something better." Andy Beal
of the search engine marketing firm WebSourced Inc. calls Google's practice
misleading because it makes it appear that the Froogle link came up because
of its relevance to the search rather than because of a Google
administrative decision: "If Google thinks there is nothing wrong with
showing Froogle at the top, why are they not clearly labeling it? They
should at least have a button that explains what it is and where these
results are coming from." (Washington Post 8 Jun 2004)

[and in a related story]

NEW WEB ADS HAVE THEIR EYE ON YOU
Lured by the success of "keyword" advertising used by Google, Yahoo
and other groups that deliver targeted advertising based on users' search
terms, ESPN and others are exploring a similar method of delivering ads
based on Web site visitors' online habits. Though some privacy experts
denounce the practice as creepy, Web sites say the technique enables them
to deliver ads that readers find relevant. "If someone spends an awful lot
of time on mutual fund pages, clearly they are interested in mutual funds,"
says Scot McLernon, executive VP at MarketWatch.com "Why not have~E mutual
fund advertising follow them?" The motivation is clear -- after a two-year
slump, Web advertising is rebounding, with more than a third of the growth
generated by keyword ads. "The noise made from billions of dollars flowing
out of their hands and into somebody else's hands made everyone sit up and
take notice," says Omar Tawakol, senior marketing VP for Revenue Science,
which offers behavioral targeting services. Advertisers pay a premium for
the service -- amounts range from 25% extra to up to 10 times the normal
rates -- but they get a better response, because they can in many cases
identify a Web surfer's location, demographic data (if provided as part of
a registration process), and numeric Internet address, which may carry
clues about the visitor's employer or line of work. In fact, companies like
Revenue Science could do much more with the data available, but will hold
off until consumers become more comfortable with the concept. "We can't

ONLINE MOVIES READY TO ROLL
RealNetworks and Starz Encore Group have launched an online movie
subscription service called Starz! Ticket on Real Movies. The companies had
planned an earlier unveiling, but said they decided to delay about a year
until the market appeared more receptive. The biggest hurdle was waiting
for a broader adoption of high-speed Internet connections, over which the
movies can be downloaded in 30 minutes or less. The service costs $12.95 a
month, giving viewers access to about 100 movies, which can be viewed an
unlimited number of times as long as they're part of Starz's roster. Once
the movie is deleted from the list, it's no longer accessible. Starz faces
competition from Movielink, which charges on a per-download basis, and
CinemaNow, which offers subscriptions or pay-per-movie options.

FTC SAYS NO TO DO-NOT-E-MAIL LIST
The Federal Trade Commission has decided that a "do not e-mail list"
modeled after the popular "do not call list" would be completely ineffective
-- and might actually have an effect just the opposite of the one intended
(since it could be used by spammers to find legitimate e-mail addresses and
send more spam). Senator Charles E. Schumer (D., NY) is critical of the
FTC's decision and insists that a do-not-e-mail list "is the best thing we
have and they ought to try it." But the FTC points out that Britain's ban of
unsolicited e-mail resulted in an increase, rather than a decrease, in the
amount of spam sent, and John R. Levine, the chairman of an organization
called the Anti-Spam Research Group, says adamantly:  "A do-not-spam list of
individual addresses is unworkable."(New York Times 16 Jun 2004)

ATTACK KNOCKS MAJOR SITES OFFLINE

[Other media said these sites were brought down for several hours,
not just 45 minutes]

An attack this week by network vandals struck Akamai Technologies,
which provides data services for Microsoft, Yahoo, Federal Express, Xerox,
the FBI and other major organizations; the attack brought down many of the
world's most-visited Web sites for about 45 minutes. An Akamai executive says
the company has "no reason to believe that the attack was directed solely at
Akamai." The company manages approximately 15% of the traffic on the Internet.

MOVE TO RESCIND BURDENSOME JUNK FAX RULES

[Something seems missing in this story,
such as the millions who receive junk faxes]

The chairman of a House subcommittee on telecommunications is
introducing a bill to rescind FCC regulations requiring senders of
commercial faxes to get prior written approval from recipients. Rep. Fred
Upton (R, MI) says his proposed bill is "common-sense regulatory relief" for
businesses and associations that have been overburdened with paperwork since
the regulations took effect. The bill has been endorsed by the full
committee's senior Democrat, John Dingell of Michigan. Newspaper publisher
Cheryl Kaechele, testifying on behalf of the National Newspaper Association,
told the subcommittee: "Our typical customers are small businesses. They
would far prefer to have us send them information by fax than to spend their
precious minutes on the telephone or in personal sales calls." And Walt
McDonald of the National Association of Realtors testified that the
inconvenience of requiring written permission from potential clients before
sending a fax "would be a giant step backwards in a business where good
customer service depends on quick turnaround."

FCC PRESERVES EDUCATIONAL SPECTRUM
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted unanimously to reject
a proposal that would have stripped educational institutions of a
portion of the broadcast spectrum set aside for them for decades.
Supporters of the proposal argued that commercial interests could
better develop a portion of the Instructional Television Fixed Service
(ITFS) with technologies including digital broadcasting. Colleges and
other organizations that use the spectrum fought the proposal; as a
result, the FCC asked the institutions to forfeit just a small portion
of underused spectrum. Some universities lease unused spectrum to
companies such as Sprint Communications and would have been prevented
from continuing those leases had the proposal been passed.

HOUSE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO BLOCK ACCENTURE CONTRACT
The Appropriations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives voted
35-17 to block a contract recently awarded to Accenture by the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The contract, which is worth as
much as $10 billion, is to help DHS improve the nation's security, but
members of the committee objected to the contract's being awarded to a
country headquartered outside the United States. Accenture has offices
in Virginia but is based in Bermuda. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.)
cosponsored an amendment to the DHS budget that would prohibit the
department from awarding contracts to companies that are incorporated
in other countries in order to avoid U.S. taxes. DeLauro said that the
"government should not be doing business with those who want all the
benefits of citizenship without any of the responsibilities that come
along with it." The amendment must pass the full House as well as the
Senate before being sent to the president for his signature.

HARVARD ONLINE FACEBOOK GOES NATIONAL
Students at Harvard University have created an online facebook that has
proven so popular that it has been expanded to more than 30 other
colleges and universities. Facebook.com is a Web site that mimics the
printed facebooks at many colleges--booklets with names, pictures, and
other information about students--with additional features that the
online medium allows. Facebook.com is restricted to college students
and alumni. Students who register with the Web site can include as much
information as they choose and can change that information over time.
They can assemble lists of friends and send electronic "pokes"--quick
messages to say hello--to other registered users. Harvard student Mark
Zuckerberg began developing Facebook.com in January, and after the
project's success at Harvard, Zuckerberg extended the site to a number
of institutions around the country. Costs to run the site, initially
quite low, have run up to $3,000, but so far the site remains free,
earning enough money from ads to stay afloat.

More Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media

Juan Catalan had spent 5 1/2 months in jail on murder charges
by the time the wheels of justice finally got into gear and
finally watched HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" which had been taping
the baseball game Juan had been at only minutes before the murder.

Juan still had his ticket stubs to the game, which he attended
with his 6 year old daughter, along with family members' testimony
as to his whereabouts the night of the murder, but this was ignored
by the police and district attorneys who claimed to have a witness
who placed Juan at the murder scene.  His request to take the lie
detector test was also ignored.  Additional cell phone evidence
that placed Juan in the stadium area about 20 minutes before the
murder had also been ignored.

Mr. Catalan, who could have faced the death penalty, has sued
the city of Los Angeles for misconduct, false imprisonment,
and defamation of character.

After 5 1/2 months in jail, a judge finally ruled that the
police and district attorneys had never had any evidence.

The University of Illinois, after spending the better part
of a million dollars lost its Illinois Appeals Court case
for violating the free speech rights of its faculty, staff
and student body when the university ordered them to stop
telling prospective faculty, athletes and others not to
come to the University of Illinois due to prevalent racism
as demonstrated by their Indian mascot, Chief Illiniwek.

The legal fees reported were only the external fees paid
to lawyers outside the university, the internal costs in
the case were not made public.

This money, if applied to eduction, could have put as many
as 50 more students through the university during the same
period from 2001 to 2004.
