just to make it easy for you to get started!]


*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, eg.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.



MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

We are in the process of rewriting some of the general FAQs and
would appreciate help proofreading them over the next few months.

We've added some new FAQs and generally updated information
about Project Gutenberg.  Take a look, and email Michael or

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 44 weeks of this year, we have produced 3448 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3448 eBooks!!!

          That's 44 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With 14,355 eBooks online as of November 10, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.70 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $.98 when we had 10,069 eBooks a year ago

Can you imagine ~14,355 books each costing ~$.28 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~14,355 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 14,355 eBooks in 33 Years and 04.00 Months We Averaged
      ~430 Per Year   [We do about 3/4 that much per month these days!]
        35.5 Per Month
         1.16 Per Day

At 3448 eBooks Done In The 314 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11 Per Day
      78 Per Week
     344 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.


                            *Flashback!!!

                   3334 New eBooks So Far in 2004

               It took us ~31 years for the first 3324 !

       That's the 9.75 months of 2004 as Compared to ~31 years!!!

MICROSOFT JOINS THE SEARCH
Microsoft is introducing an Internet search service positioned to compete
with Google and Yahoo. Details of the service are expected tomorrow.  John
Tinker of the investment bank ThinkEquity Partners suggests that Microsoft's
initial product will be just the beginning of a much larger competitive
threat: "I think Microsoft is a couple of years from doing anything serious,
but it's a reminder that the big bad evil beast is out there."

SPITTING MAD AT SPAM
Spam over Internet telephony, known as SPIT, will become commonplace as
more people make phone calls over the Internet. Internet researcher Michael
Osterman warns that Web-based phone systems attacked by spam will "trash
voice-mail systems," and explains: "You can easily delete 100 spam text
messages. But try to weed through a voice-mail system filled with 100
unsolicited pitches. That's a pain." Spam is already appearing frequently on
instant messages, cell phones, and blogs, and one executive of an Internet
service provider admits: "As everything gets connected, there are more ways
to spam consumers. Spam is everywhere." (USA Today 9 Nov 2004)

UNANIMOUS RULING: FCC, NOT STATES, WILL REGULATE VOIP
The Federal Communications Commission has ruled that the federal government
--rather than state regulatory bodies -- has the authority to oversee phone
service offered over the Internet (known as Voice over Internet Protocol,
or VoIP). FCC chairman Michael K. Powell says, "This landmark order
recognizes that a revolution has occurred. Internet voice services
have cracked the 19th century mold to the great benefit of consumers."

E-LEARNING MEANS LESS MONEY FOR TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS
A school superintendent in Colorado explains the plight of traditional
schools faced with declining enrollments due to competition from new systems
of learning: "If I lose two kids, that's $20,000 walking out the door... I
was worried about making sure that if one student left, my budget wasn't a
disaster." The state gives each school a per-pupil reimbursement for
students who attend brick-and-mortar schools, but spends only $5,627 to
educate each online student in Colorado. In almost all schools in that
state, the cost of educating an online student is lower than for a
traditional student. (Los Angeles Times 9 Nov 2004)

P2P RADIO IS LATEST TWIST IN MUSIC SHARING
Now there's a new way to share music that's free and perfectly legal
--the trick involves marrying peer-to-peer technology with Internet radio.
Pioneers in the field include Apple, Virgin Digital, and startups Mercora
and Live 365, which offer tools that automatically stream users' private
playlists over the Web while in some cases storing them in a searchable
database for later retrieval. Mercora operates a Web-based network of about
8,000 "broadcasters" who serve up their playlists to somewhere between
175,000 and 200,000 listeners worldwide. "We're doing for music what Google
did for the Web," says Mercora CEO Srivats Sampath. The company reasons
that by using an Internet broadcast network model, it can take advantage of
lower copyright fees, which are set by the U.S. Copyright Office rather
than the record labels. As a result, Mercora can afford to pay the fees on
behalf of broadcasters and offset the costs through advertising sales. "The
big nut we had to crack is how to do this legally," says Sampath. "The law
says you can broadcast as long as you pay. Fine, we will pay you." And if
listeners happen to download a song? Technically, if the legally broadcast
song is for personal use only, that's okay. "It's like a tape recorder,"
says Sampath. However, the downloader runs into legal trouble only when she
tries to sell a track or transfer it to another person.

NIGERIAN SCAMMER JAILED

[5 years jail for $5 million. . .sounds like not enough jail time,
and you know they didn't get the $5 million back. . . .]

The Australian mastermind of a global Internet scam was today
sentenced to at least four years behind bars. Nick Marinellis pleaded
guilty in the New South Wales District Court to 10 counts of fraud and one
count of perverting the course of justice over the so-called Nigerian or
West African scam. The ruse fleeced victims of $5 million. Judge Barry
Mahoney sentenced Marinellis to five years and three months jail with a
non-parole period of four years and four months. (The Australian 8 Nov

BIDDING UP PRICES ON ONLINE AUCTIONS

[Was this penalty enough, either?  How about the rest of the scammed?]

Eight eBay sellers who bid up products online to inflate their prices
have been ordered by the New York Attorney General's office to pay almost
$90,000 in restitution and fines. More than 120 people will receive money
from the settlement of the three cases. One man will receive a check for
$3,089 after overpaying for a 1999 Jeep Cherokee sport-utility vehicle he
bought from an eBay seller in 2002.(Washington Post 7 Nov 2004)

IRAN'S CRACKDOWN ON PRO-DEMOCRACY WEB SITES
In the past several months Iran has blocked hundreds of pro-democracy
Web sites and arrested such journalists as Mahboubeh Abbas-Gholizadeh and
Fereshteh Ghazi, both of whom write about women's issues. But the move to
block Web sites has the support of senior cleric  Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi,
who declared in September that Web sites should be blocked if they "insult
sacred concepts of Islam, the Prophet and Imams," or  if they publish
"harmful and deviated beliefs to promote atheism or promote sinister books."

GAME MAKERS THREATENED BY PATENT LAWSUIT
Computer game makers, including such big names as Electronic Arts,
Atari and Sega, have been sued by Texas-based McKool Smith, which claims
the makers' games violate a 1987 patent that covers a way to display 3D
objects realistically in a 2D space, such as a computer monitor. The
technique is used by almost every game that uses 3D modeling, including
older games such as Quake and Doom. The companies are now frantically
researching prior art, citing games such as The Colony and Spectre, which
may have been released before the 1987 patent was granted.

IRELAND TO SILENCE MOBILES IN CINEMAS, THEATERS
Ireland's cinemas and theatres have been given the go-ahead by the
country's communications watchdog to permit the use of mobile phone
interceptors. Interceptors will allow the creation of "quiet zones" where
the mobile phones will not ring but where calls can still be made to
emergency services or to lists of approved numbers, the Communications
Regulator said on Wednesday. (The Age 4 Nov 2004) rec'd from John Lamp

INDIA UNVEILS NATIONAL INTERNET HUB
India has created a national Internet service hub to connect all
service providers and boost web traffic in the country of one billion
people. Until now, domestic Internet service providers have been forced to
rely on international traffic routing providers to run their Web sites, and
so Information and Technology Minister Dayanidhi Maran says the new plan
will help to "proliferate the Internet" in that domestic service providers
will now be able to reduce the cost of traffic routing and improve service

CELL PHONE PHOTOS MAKE THE FRONT PAGE
Twice in the last month De Telegraaf, the Netherlands' largest newspaper,
has run front-page photos snapped by amateur photographers using their
cell phones. Wednesday De Telegraaf published a grisly picture of the
body of filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh, who police suspect was
stabbed to death by an Islamic militant. Passerby Aron Boskma took the
photo at the crime scene in Amsterdam before the body had been covered.
"This picture was the story. There was a discussion if we should use it,
but everyone who would have had this picture would have published it,"
says Telegraaf pictures editor Peter Schoonen. Last month Dutch newspapers
published cell phone pictures of a police shoot-out in the town of
Enschede. In Japan, where many citizens now have camera-equipped cell
phones, it is common practice to sell news-breaking pictures to TV stations
and other media outlets. (Reuters 3 Nov 2004)

IE LOSING GROUND TO OPEN SOURCE BROWSERS
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser is still the overwhelming
market leader [93%?], but the percentage of Americans using open-source
alternatives Mozilla and Firefox inched up to 6% in October from 3.5% in
June. Apple's Safari and the Opera browsers combined were employed by just
a little over 1% of users, according to online research firm WebSideStory.
The results were gleaned by sensors embedded on major Web sites that
identified which browsers visitors were using to access the sites. And
although Mozilla and Firefox constitute a miniscule portion of the browser
market, some analysts say their steady rise may signal a trend. "What we're
seeing is (Mozilla and Firefox) looking more like a vanguard than a flash
in the pan," says WebSideStory analyst Geoff Johnston.

MICROSOFT SETTLES MORE SUITS
Microsoft this week moved another step closer to clearing its slate of
pending antitrust legislation when it reached a $536 million settlement
with Novell over that company's NetWare operating system. In exchange,
Novell will withdraw from the antitrust case brought by the European
Commission (EC) against Microsoft. Microsoft also settled with the
Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), which had
challenged the terms of the antitrust settlement between Microsoft and
the Justice Department. Under that deal, Microsoft will join the CCIA
and will pay undisclosed legal expenses; the CCIA will stop seeking a
review of the settlement with the Justice Department and will also
withdraw from the EC case. Since the landmark deal with the Justice
Department, Microsoft has now spent about $3 billion to settle
antitrust complaints, and the company might still be liable for another
$950 million for outstanding lawsuits, including one by RealNetworks.
Despite Microsoft's argument that the EC should end its case in light
of the new settlements, an EC spokesperson said regulators would not be
ending their investigations and would insist on enforcing sanctions
against the company.

USING VIDEO GAMES TO IMPROVE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE
Athletes at a number of colleges and universities are testing an
application called IntelliGym designed to improve athletic performance
through video games. Daniel Gopher, the research supervisor at the
company that developed IntelliGym, is known for his work in training
Israeli fighter pilots in the 1980s with video simulations. Cadets in
that program reportedly "performed significantly better" than others
who did not train with the computer games, and Gopher has applied the
same ideas to sports. Basketball players at the University of Memphis
are testing the IntelliGym program, which does not simulate basketball
but purportedly develops decision-making and visual skills applicable
to the game. IntelliGym endeavors to train players to keep track of
several things happening at one time, to discern patterns among moving
objects, and to make fast decisions.

NEXTEL AND VERIZON SETTLE DISPUTE

[unlike MicroSoft. . .]

In a settlement widely regarded as a win for Nextel Communications, the
wireless provider and Verizon Wireless have ended a long-running
dispute over trademarks and reallocation of spectrum. Under the deal,
Nextel will drop a lawsuit against Verizon alleging trademark
infringement for use of the term "push to talk," and Nextel agreed not
to pursue such charges against Verizon or any other carrier that uses
the term. Meanwhile, Verizon will end its opposition to a reallocation
of radio-wave spectrum between the government and Nextel. Nextel's
network was woven together with various slices of the spectrum that
often caused interference with emergency workers, such as police and
firefighters. A proposed spectrum swap with the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) would eliminate much of that interference, but Verizon
objected because the swap would also allow Nextel to upgrade its
network fairly easily and to offer high-speed data services. Under the
deal with the FCC, Nextel will return about $2 billion worth of
spectrum to the FCC and will spend at least $3.2 billion to help
relocate users affected by the change. The Government Accountability
Office still has to rule on whether the FCC has the authority to swap
the spectrum as outlined in the deal.

VIRGINIA SEES FIRST FELONY SPAM CONVICTION
A brother and sister in Virginia have been found guilty under that
state's antispam law, which some describe as the toughest in the
nation. Jeremy D. Jaynes and Jessica DeGroot, who live in North
Carolina, were charged with sending unsolicited e-mail from a bogus
return address. Prosecutors said the e-mail the pair sent advertised
fraudulent products, such as a "FedEx refund processor" that supposedly
allowed users to earn $75 an hour from their homes. During one month,
Jaynes reportedly received 10,000 orders for the processor, which was
priced at $39.95. Jurors in the nation's first felony conviction for
spam will now consider punishment for the two defendants. Prosecutors
have asked the jury to sentence Jaynes to the maximum 15 years in
prison and have requested an unspecified prison term for DeGroot.

*Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media


Many of you have probably heard that a US National Guard F-16 fighter
shot up the Little Egg Harbor Intermediate School in New Jersey, but
you probably also heard that the damage from the 20mm cannon was minimal,
leaving only puncture marks on the roof and parking lot.


[From an anonymous source on another listserver]

"For your information, 20mm cannon shells are 5 times as massive as your
standard every day police 9mm Glock bullets, and are travelling so much
faster that you probably wouldn't believe it [when they leave the plane].

"The idea that these would only leave "puncture marks in the school's roof"
is hardly testing the bloggers who challenged Dan Rather last month.

"As an example, a .50 caliber machine gun would go right through a steel
I-beam one inch thick. . .and this is only about 12.7mm in size, so I
think any kind of follow-up examination will show that there is a LOT
of damage to anything these 25 cannon rounds hit."

***

And in addition to the story below, it would appear
that the US has had missiles prepared to knock down
satellites from both ground and air-based launchers
for quite some time.


US ADMITS TO DEPLOYMENT OF SPACE WARFARE TECHNOLOGY

Washington, DC, October 29

The US Air Force's Space Commanders finally admitted that they
had very quietly launched and activated various new weapons systems
aimed at jamming electronic satellite communications systems of the
other space faring countries of the world.

The "Counter Communications Systems has been in operation since last
month as per information from Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs.

Since the US does not currently have any operational space shuttles,
one is left to presume any orbital components were launched via the
recent Russian launch that orbited the most recent US astronaut.
However, no reference to any space-based components was made.
Announcements only mentioned ground-based RF [radio frequency] jammers
similar in concept to radio jammers since WW II.

***

...and in a related story, the FCC approval of the use of power lines to
transmit internet data will essentially wipe out certain shortwave and CB
frequencies in the USA (high-amplitude modulation at high frequencies,
a loud constant blast of radio noise which will drown out everything else
on those frequencies)... thankfully, this means that Americans will no longer be
subjected to the annoyance of news programs originating from the rest of the
world, which only served to confuse the situation and make peoples' heads
hurt with contradictory information, anyway... commerical truckers, who rely
on CB radio, will not be reachable for comment on their CB radios. . . .


*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

"I tried 10 times to vote for Kerry,
but it always came up Bush."


*PREDICTION OF THE WEEK

This election will bear surprising
similarities to the previous one,
and to the last president declaring
a "mandate" when re-elected, Nixon.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Women in US prisons are increasing at a rate
double that of men.


and. . . .

Not one of the major US television networks
has mentioned in their reasons for reporting
Vice President Gore as having been elected
to serve as president that perhaps those in
their exit polls actually thought they had
voted for Gore, but their votes didn't count.

and. . .

In a recent issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, the
Atlanta-based federal agency said that bigger luggage is not the only thing
weighing down airliners and causing them to burn more costly fuel. In fact,
the CDC said, the average weight of Americans increased by 10 pounds during
the 1990s - requiring an extra 350 million gallons of jet fuel to fly them
around during 2000.
