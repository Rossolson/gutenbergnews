.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the world,
and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on the search
results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest
to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

EBooks numbered 1 to 10000 are located in "release year" directories.
Over time, the "release year" advanced, so that by November 2003 the
release year was 2006.  Starting with eBook #10001, they are filed by
their official eBook number, with a unique subdirectory based on that
eBook number.

FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000

To get to a directory listing you can use either:

   http://gutenberg.net/1/
     - or -
   ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/

Then navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the
appropriate level, and then select the file you wish to download,
using your usual download procedures.  This system works on mirrors,
too, and will hold all eBooks starting with the number "1" for
10,000 and beyond.


FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000:

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download site
(or a mirror) if you know the filename and year you want.  For example,
navigate to either:

   http://gutenberg.net/etext06/
     - or -
   ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/

and then look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that
updated eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99,
etext00, etc.)

However. . .

The Production Team continues the process of manually re-posting these
ebooks to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.

Joe Loewenstein provides the following about #12640, "Trial of Mary Blandy",
edited by William Roughead:
Mary Blandy (then 31 years old) was hanged in 1752 for poisoning her
father. She had made the mistake of advertising for a husband and
offering a dowry of 10,000 pounds. She fell for one of the scoundrels
she attracted, and he talked her into poisoning her father. Her trial at
the Oxford Assizes and her subsequent hanging were public sensations.
She was said to have been a very modest woman, and her final plea to the
hangman was, "Don't hang me high."

>From David Price, "For those wishing to know. . .":

#12651, The Humour of Homer and Other Essays:  This turns out to be a
repackaging of Samuel Butler's "Essays on Life, Art and Science" - already
done and released by Project Gutenberg (EBook #3461 - Ed.).  The additions
in this book are:
1.  Introduction by R. A. Streatfeild - Butler's friend and
     literary executor.
2.  A Life of Samuel Butler by his friend Henry Festing Jones.
     Project Gutenberg already has another short work on Butler
     by Mr. Festing Jones.  (EBook #2993 - Ed.)
3.  Samuel Butler's talk on "The Humour of Homer".  It was in this
     talk, to the Working Men's College, Great Ormond Street,
     London, on 30th January 1892, that Butler first publically
     announced his discovery - that the Odyssey, traditionally
     thought to have been written by Homer, was in fact written
     by a woman.  Needless to say this discovery was greeted with
     shock and other emotions.
Those wishing for a full explanation of Butler's discovery will need to wait
until next week when I should release "The Authoress of the Odyssey" by
Samuel Butler.

#12674, Cock Lane and Common-Sense, by Andrew Lang
For those wishing to know: In "Dreams and Ghosts" (previously released by
Project Gutenberg) Andrew Lang gently hinted at some of his views of the
matter of ghosts etc.  In this book he explores the subject much more deeply.
He's doesn't much care for the dismissive way in which ghost stories are treated
- and feels they should be investigated in a more scientific manner. The "Cock
Lane" of the title was one of the most famous "discredited" ghosts. Everyone who
was anyone in London, 1762, was involved in the Cock Lane ghost investigation -
but as Andrew relates there hasty conclusions and lack of checking it comes
across as a golden opportunity missed.

Jim Tinsley comments on #12655, "The Boy Mechanic: Volume 1", by Popular
Mechanics:
. . .I commend the PDF file. . .for people who just want to read the book.
As a side-note: this one's a gem! There is NO END to the
trouble I coulda gotten into if I'da had this when I was 12. :-)
