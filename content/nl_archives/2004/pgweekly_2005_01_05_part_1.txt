***Hot Requests New Sites and Announcements


"[beta-testing continues on bowerbird's viewer-app -- "give".
designed to turn plain-ascii e-texts into full-on e-books.
features include an automatic table-of-contents menu,
italics/bold, automatic hotlinks, big and bold headers,
illustrations!, and the usual ability to pick font/size/colors.
please help shape the future of this viewer for your e-texts!
to participate, send e-mail to:  zml_talk@yahoogroups.com  ]"


Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.


*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, eg.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject

and

The PG bittorrent tracker is up and running.
Aaron Cannon has placed the CD and DVD there if anyone wants to test.
You can access it by visiting
http://snowy.arsc.alaska.edu:6969

***

We are in the process of rewriting some of the general FAQs and
would appreciate help proofreading them over the next few months.

We've added some new FAQs and generally updated information
about Project Gutenberg.  Take a look, and email Michael or
Greg with any suggestions or corrections.  We'll have these
updated from time to time, now that we've passed #10,000.
A new set of these will be in the works when we pass #20,000.

***Continuing Requests and Announcements


We're building a team to read our eBooks into MP3 files
for the visually impaired and other audio book users.

Let us know if you'd like to join this group.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 14 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have
regular needs for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby <gbnewby AT pglaf.org> ,
if you can help.

This is much more important than many of us realize!

We're still keeping up with Moore's Law!

Moore's Law 12 month percentage =  63%

Moore's Law 18 month percentage = 122%

[100% of Moore's Law = doubling every 18 months]
[There may be some need to refine our program for these figures]

single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 52 weeks of this year, we have produced 4,049 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2001 to produce our FIRST 4,049 eBooks!!!

          That's 52 WEEKS as Compared to ~30 1/3 YEARS!!!


FLASHBACK!

Here's a sample of what books we were doing around eBook #4049

May 2003 Mates at Billabong, by Mary Grant Bruce           [mtsbbxxx.xxx] 4050
May 2003 Piccolissima, by Eliza Lee Follen      [Follen #9][pcclsxxx.xxx] 4049
May 2003 The Talkative Wig, by Eliza Lee Follen     [ELF#8][tktvwxxx.xxx] 4048
May 2003 The Leavenworth Case, by Anna Katharine Green [#6][lvnwrxxx.xxx] 4047
May 2003 The Garden of Survival, by Algernon Blackwood     [grdnsxxx.xxx] 4046

May 2003 Omoo, by Herman Melville              [Melville#5][omoosxxx.xxx] 4045
May 2003 What the Animals Do and Say, by E.L.Follen [ELF#7][wtnmlxxx.xxx] 4044
May 2003 The Dynasts, by Thomas Hardy            [Hardy#24][dynstxxx.xxx] 4043
May 2003 Mozart:The Man and the Artist, by Kerst & Krehbiel[wammaxxx.xxx] 4042
May 2003 Conscience, by Eliza Lee Follen         [Follen#6][cnscnxxx.xxx] 4041

May 2003 The Pedler of Dust Sticks, by Eliza Lee Follen[#5][pdlrdxxx.xxx] 4040
May 2003 Volpone; Or, The Fox, Ben Jonson       [Jonson #5][vlpnrxxx.xxx] 4039
May 2003 Imaginary Portraits, Walter Horatio Pater     [#6][?imagxxx.xxx] 4038
May 2003 Appreciations, With An Essay on Style, Pater  [#5][?awaexxx.xxx] 4037
May 2003 Essays From The Guardian, Walter Horatio Pater[#4][?essgxxx.xxx] 4036


With 14,956 eBooks online as of January 05, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.67 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $.92 when we had 10,821 eBooks a year ago.

Can you imagine ~14,956 books each costing ~$.25 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~14,956 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 14,956 eBooks in 33 Years and 06.00 Months We Averaged
       446 Per Year   [We do about 3/4 that much per month these days!]
        37.2 Per Month
         1.22 Per Day

At 4049 eBooks Done In The 364 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11 Per Day
      78 Per Week
     337 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

[There haven't been many issues of Newsscan and Edupage
recently, due to the holidays, so very few articles here.]


THE FUTURE OF PUBLISHING: THE WEB, OF COURSE
The distinguished computer scientist Ramesh Jain says in his blog
that his interview with John Gehl for Ubiquity received widespread
attention and demonstrated that the importance of paper publications is
becoming less significant compared to appearance of ideas or articles in
cyberspace: "None of my articles that appeared in well respected journals
got the attention of relevant people so rapidly... I am convinced that this
is clearly the direction for ideas propagation and distribution." And last
week's Ubiquity interview with technology visionary Michael Schrage also
received a tremendous response from readers. You'll find the two interviews
at: <http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/interviews/v5i29_jain.html> and
<http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/interviews/v5i39_schrage.html>


RADAR INFO 'MORE RELIABLE' THAN WHAT THE AIRLINES TELL YOU

[Tired of not being able to believe what the airlines tell you?]

The Yosemite International Airport in Fresno, California, has become the
first in the nation to use a Web-based wireless system that relies strictly
on radar (rather than on reports from the airline carriers themselves) to
obtain the flight information it displays on monitors and portable kiosks.
Ron Dunsky, of the company that developed the software, says: "It is a way
to inexpensively kick information up to a more accurate level."
(AP/Washington Post 4 Jan 2005)
<www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46599-2005Jan4.html?nav=headlines>


'ENHANCED INTENSIVE CARE': IF YOU NEED IT YOU'LL WANT IT

[Waiting for first story of a patient dying "live" on camera
while no one is paying attention to what the camera is showing]

New technology known as eICU ("Enhanced Intensive Care") lets
physicians miles away from their patents manage health care via cameras and
banks of computer screens. Developed by Baltimore-based VISICU Inc., the
technology is already in use at least 18 hospital systems nationwide.
Whereas traditional health care systems rely on nurses to notice a problem
with a patient and relay the information to a doctor, eICU informs the
doctor directly. The doctor can check the patient's ventilator, intravenous
medication and anything else in the patient's room, and one physician notes:
"The camera is such that I can count eyelashes."

ANOTHER HIGH-TECH LEAP IN INDIA

[India and China will be moving up the technology ladder, just watch.]

The Indian state Andhra Pradesh is planning a new $90-million network
that will move data between Hyderabad, the state's capital, and 23 districts
at a speed more than 5,000 times the speed of the existing network.
Hyderabad is already a hub of knowledge-based industries, and it has
attracted Microsoft and numerous other world-class companies to establish
research centers there. Mohammed Ali Shabbir, the state's information
minister, predicts predicts the new system will revolutionize the entire
communication network. He explains: "Widespread availability of broadband
services at very low and affordable rates is expected to take government
services to the doorsteps of the citizens and also trigger significant
economic activity in every sector." (AP 3 Jan 2004)

COLLEGES EXPAND RECRUITING TECHNOLOGY
As the effectiveness of e-mail as an admissions tool declines, colleges
and universities are beginning to explore alternative recruitment
Internet strategies. At the top of the list for many institutions are
streaming videos of campus, either on the school's Web page or in the
form of video magazines, or Vmags. Saint Mary's College in Notre Dame
began testing a Vmag two years ago, sending it to students who had been
accepted but had not yet decided to enroll. Saint Mary's Vmag includes
four videos, each between one and two minutes, showing various
activities on campus. Users who have downloaded the Vmag are prompted
when new versions are available. Many believe video is able to persuade
in ways that fixed images are not. Westminster College in Salt Lake
City has added 136 video clips to its Web site in an effort to appeal
to prospective students. Joel Bauman, vice president for enrollment at
Westminster, said the videos are fairly inexpensive to produce. Karen
Giannino, senior associate dean of admission at Colgate University in
Hamilton, N.Y., said the videos added to her institution's Web site
help "tell our story in a compelling way" and "differentiate Colgate"
from similar schools.

EBAY TO DISCONTINUE PASSPORT
Online auction site eBay has announced it will discontinue support of
Microsoft's Passport service later this month. The service offers
registered users a single location to store personal information
including names, addresses, and credit card numbers. When shopping at
online vendors participating in the service, users can access their
profiles for transactions with just a single login. Since its debut in
1999, however, Passport has failed to live up to expectations, in part
due to competition as well as to security concerns among consumers. In
addition, retailers were slow to sign up for fear that Microsoft might
begin charging fees to retailers for the service. A spokesperson from
eBay said that the percentage of its customers who regularly signed in
using Passport was "very small." Despite losing one of the largest online
retailers in eBay, Microsoft said the Passport service will continue.

COPYRIGHT LEVY ATTACHED TO GERMAN PC SALES
A German court has ordered one of the country's largest PC makers to
pay a levy for each new computer sold, to compensate copyright holders
for royalties lost to copying. Germany has long charged such levies on
devices used for copying content, including blank audio and video
cassettes. The VG Wort rights society, which represents copyright
holders in Germany, had asked the court to charge Fujitsu Siemens
Computers 30 euros (US$41) per computer; the court decided on a levy of
12 euros. VG Wort said it will work to make all PC vendors in Germany
subject to the same levy. Bernd Bischoff, CEO of Fujitsu Siemens, said
the levy is "a de facto tax on PCs," which will tend to decrease sales.
Officials from Fujitsu Siemens said they will consider appealing the
decision and have asked the German government to review the copyright
levies as they apply to digital technologies.

TECHNOLOGY REVIEW



*Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media



*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

About last week's quote:

The actual quote by Jan Egeland, the United Nations' emergency
relief coordinator and former head of the Norwegian Red Cross:

"We were more generous when we were less rich, many of the rich countries.
And it is beyond me, why are we so stingy, really.  Even Christmas time
should remind many Western countries at least how rich we have become."

George Stephanopolis questionned Secretary of State Colin Powell
about this, asking pretty much the same question I did:  Why was
the original estimate barely into the millions of dollars, when
it was obvious from the start that it would/should/could approach
a billion dollars?

Not to mention why President Bush took four days before giving out
any statement whatsoever.


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

I'm sure you've all now heard this spin-doctored beyond belief,
so I'll let it be other than to add that when all is said and done,
perhaps over a year from now, the death toll might be 1/4 million,
possibly the second greatest natural disaster of all time.

[There was an earthquake in Japan in the 1500s that perhaps took
1/2 million lives, perhaps 3/4 million.]


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


More on TIMSS

I'm not at all sure why the 8th grade math scores got the
press releases a few weeks ago, my own comparisons with a
report from 1999 that I saved showed that the U.S. scores
in 8th grade science showed much more of a change:

1999

Rank  Country Name       Score
28    United States       500

2003
Rank  Country Name       Score
09    United States       527

This shows a 5% increase in absolute scoring, and drastic
improvement in international ranking.

[Perhaps it was a misprint, and the press releases should
have said Science, not Math]

At any rate, here are the top 15 in each category of 2003:

TIMSS = Third International Mathematics and Science Study

Three weeks ago nearly every new service had positive comments
about the improved U.S. students' TIMSS test scores that come
out every four years.  Only one source I heard had the nerve
to say that the scores didn't really show any improvement,
while the rest seemed to reek of jingoism.

However, in reviewing the scores, it seems obvious that the
U.S. test scores in question, the 8th grade math scores,
were basically unchanged, moving up less than 1% from the
1999 score of 500 to the 2003 score of 504, out of 800.

This represents a change of 1/5 of 1% per year, which I
seriously doubt is within the statistical parameters of
the TIMSS testing methodologies.  [This is 1/8% if you
measure from the total of 800 points, or a 1/2% total
change over the four year period, an increment these
kinds of tests are not reported to target.]

Much more likely is the fact that the U.S. ranking has
been changed more by changes in the other countries,
both in terms of the changes the countries chosen for
the 2003 tests, and the performance changes of those
countries that stayed the same.

More details of score changes in the top 20 of 1999:

Rank Country            1999/2003  Change

1/1   Singapore           643/605  =  38
2/2   Korea               607/589  =  18
3/5   Japan               605/570  =  35
4/3   Hong Kong           588/586  =   3
6/6   Belgium (Fl)        565/537  =  28
7/13  Slovak Republic     547/508  =  39
9/7   Netherlands         541/536  =   5
9/21  Slovenia            541/493  =  48
[Netherlands and Slovenia tied in 1999]
11/25 Bulgaria            540/476  =  66
14/9  Hungary             537/529  =   7
16/14 Australia           530/505  =  25

Avg. of 11 listed here:   568/539  =  29

Change in U.S. Score:     500/504  =   4

Change in U.S. Rank        28/15   =  13

Obviously the other countries changed much more than the U.S.,
over 7 times as much change, not to mention that many of the
countries tested in 1999 were not tested in 2003, a factor of
change much greater than that of the U.S. performance change.

Thus we see that that most other countries changed
much more than did the U.S., which changed very little.
It would appear that the U.S. didn't really move on the
charts so much as other countries moved up and down past
the U.S.

In addition, it appears that the science scores were not
mentioned in these news reports, nor were the scores for
students in the lower grade classes.  I will have to dig
them up to let you know more about them in later issues.
