Hot Headlines!!!

From: Eric Eldred <ericeldred@usa.net>

"According to a Boston Globe article, the federal government has
ordered that some pamphlets already issued to federal depository
libraries be taken out of circulation and returned because they
are internal.  Librarians note that the information has long been
in the public domain and are resisting the order.

http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/07/24/libraries_ordered_to_d
estroy_us_pamphlets/

[below a snippet from that site]

The office's one-paragraph directive listed the five pamphlets, with
titles such as "Civil and Criminal Forfeiture Procedure" and "Select
Federal Assets Forfeiture Statutes," and instructed librarians to
"withdraw these materials immediately and destroy all copies by any
means to prevent disclosure of their content," according to a copy of
the e-mail sent to the Boston Public Library and all other depository
libraries.

Calls to the Government Printing Office seeking comment were not
returned.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
and *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 29 weeks of this year, we have produced 2458 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 2458 eBooks!!!

          That's 29 WEEKS as Compared to ~29 YEARS!!!


With 13,365 eBooks online as of July 28, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.75 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.14 when we had 8705 eBooks a year Ago

Can you imagine ~13,365 books each costing ~$.39 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~13,365 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 13,365 eBooks in 33 Years and 00.75 Months We Averaged
       404 Per Year   [We do nearly that much a month these days!]
        33.6 Per Month
         1.11 Per Day

At 2458 eBooks Done In The 209 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      12 Per Day
      84 Per Week
     364 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

>From NewsScan:


TIVO'S EXPANSION PLANS OPPOSED BY COPYRIGHT HOLDERS

[MPAA Is Not Only Against "Time Shifting," But Now Against "Space Shifting."]

In filings with the Federal Communications Commission, Hollywood studios
and other creators of digital content are trying to block the maker of
TiVo television recording devices from letting users watch copies of
shows and movies on devices outside their homes. TiVo wants to expand its
system next year to allow programs to be transferred to registered devices
outside the home -- such as at an office, vacation cabin, or friend's house.
The Motion Picture Association of America opposes this plan, and its general
counsel says: "Our concern is grounded in the fact that the remote access is
not limited to the recipient's summer home or boat or office. The people
that can receive the programming can be totally unrelated in any place on
the globe." (Washington Post 21 Jul 2004)

IBM TO BUILD SUPERCOMPUTER FOR DOD

[Out of Mac and Nintendo Parts!!!]

IBM has been awarded a contract to build the U.S. military's fastest
supercomputer, a 20 teraflop system that will cost about $100 million to
build. The fourth-fastest computer in the world, the system will be used to
produce short-term weather forecasts for Navy fleets at sea and to allow
military scientists to model atmosphere and ocean dynamics for the entire
surface of the Earth. Other uses will be to analyze aircraft material at a
molecular level and to examine the flow of water around submarine hulls to
improve their design. The supercomputer's design calls for 368 of IBM's
high-end corporate servers, using processors from the family of chips that
power Apple's G5 Macintosh desktops and Nintendo's video game consoles.

MOBILE-PHONE WALLETS
In Japan "smart cards" for making consumer purchases may soon be replaced
by virtual-wallet technology. A series of cellphones going on sale this
summer in Japan, for use on NTT DoCoMo's wireless network, are the
world's first with an embedded computer chip that you can fill up with
electronic cash. To pay you simply wave your cell phone within a few inches
of a special display found in stores, restaurants and vending machines
around Japan. Unlike infrared or other mobile payment schemes that require
clicks on the handset, you don't even need to open your phone. But whatever
money is stored on the phone is like cash, so if you lose your wallet you
lose your money. Just like the good old days. (AP/USA Today 22 Jul 2004)

44 MILLION TELECOMMUTERS
A study by In-Stat/MDR predicts that 44 million US workers will be
telecommuting this year, either full-time or working from home on a
part-time basis. The number of telecommuters is expected to grow by 2008 to
51 million, with 14 million working full-time at home. The report notes that
the rise in telecommuting has fuelled growth in high-speed Internet by home
users: "Companies too are supporting this movement, with some firms going so
far as to subsidizing the equipment and service expense to allow their
employees to work from home." (The Age 21 Jul 2004) Rec'd from John Lamp

GOOGLE IN ITS YOUTH
Google is being sued for age discrimination by a 54-year-old terminated
manager who says he was told that he didn't fit in with Google's culture of
"youth and energy." The company prides itself on being an enlightened
employer, but the lawsuit alleges that Google purposely avoids hiring older
workers. Google denies the accusations. (San Jose Mercury News 24 Jul 2004)

VIETNAM STEPS UP CONTROL OF INTERNET

[In the interest of "National Security"--see earlier story about China]
[Similar efforts in China this month blocked access to Google]

Vietnam has stepped up efforts to control the Internet, instructing
Internet service providers to terminate contracts with cyber-cafes that
allow customers to access pornographic or anti-government sites. The
directive, issued by Minister of Post and Telecommunications Do Trung Ta, is
the latest in a string of measures unveiled in recent months to prevent "bad
and poisonous information" being circulated online. This latest regulation
requires the communist nation's seven state-owned Internet service providers

CHINA GOES IT ALONE ON HIGH-TECH STANDARDS

[More about China's truly remarkable growth plans]

DVD? China's trying to do it one better -- with a technology called
EVD. CDMA? The digital cell phone standard is so 2003, the Chinese say. Give
TD-SCDMA a try instead. Intel's Centrino and Microsoft's Windows? If you're
doing business with Beijing, better bone up on WAPI and Red Flag Linux, too.
These days, China's dominant message is this: We'll embrace the world -- but
on our terms. And nowhere is this more evident than in the realm of high
technology, where behind the acronyms is a battle of standards that could
have global repercussions. Pushed by their government, Chinese firms are
shunning technological protocols invented abroad and developing their own.
They want Chinese-made video discs to run on Chinese-invented players, and
they want Chinese consumers linking up with China-developed mobile gadgets.

DUKE FRESHMEN TO RECEIVE IPODS

[Can eBooks on iPods Be Far Behind?]

Duke University has announced a plan to give each of its 1,650 incoming
freshman this fall an Apple iPod as an experiment to see how the
devices affect teaching and learning. Each iPod will come with
orientation information and an academic calendar installed. Duke will
set up a Web site from which students can download course materials,
lectures, audio books, and other academic content to their iPods.
Although the project is not designed to discourage copyright
infringement, according to Tracy Futhey, vice president of information
technology at Duke, having "an easy-to-use legal alternative" could
provide students with an incentive to limit illegal file trading. The
project is estimated to cost Duke $500,000, and students will keep the
iPods. After the school year is over, school officials will evaluate
the educational benefits of the program.

[and even more open source and open competition]

IBM LOOKS TO COMPETE WITH MICROSOFT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS
A new initiative from IBM aims to offer alternatives to Microsoft
products in academic settings. Because Windows computers are so common,
many academic programs focus on teaching software development using
Microsoft's operating system and development tools, according to Haym
Hirsh, chairman of the computer science department at Rutgers
University in New Jersey. Hirsh added, however, that "we don't want
our students to come out knowing only one way to do things." Under
IBM's new program, interested colleges and universities will be given
access to software and development tools, including open-source
products as well as proprietary IBM products such as the DB2 database
and WebSphere Internet software. Institutions will also have access to
course-development assistance from IBM's in-house training programs.
Officials from IBM said the program involves more than simply the
promotion of IBM hardware and software, responding to demand from
academic interests to have a broader range of options for teaching
computer science.

[and yet more open access]

BRITISH GOVERNMENT PUSHES OPEN ACCESS
Less than a week after a Congressional committee in the United States
called for open access to government-funded research, Britain's
Science and Technology Committee has issued a report with a similar
recommendation. Like the U.S. report, the British report does not
require open access but strongly encourages scholarly publications to
be either posted on public Web sites or published in "author-pays"
journals, in which authors pay a fee to have their research published,
thereby eliminating fees for subscription. The report also calls on the
government to subsidize author-pays fees for scholars and encourages
academics to retain copyright over their published works, rather than
signing copyright over to the journals that publish them, which
typically happens today. The British Office of Science and Technology
may issue new regulations based on the report this fall. Meanwhile,
Reed Elsevier, the largest publisher of scientific journals, last month
announced that authors of its publications would be allowed to post
copies of their work on institutional Web sites. A spokesperson for
Reed Elsevier said the publisher welcomed the report, though it
believes "some of the concerns expressed in the report about government
policy on scientific publishing to be overstated."

SCHOOL PROJECT LEADS TO CHEAP MOBILE-PHONE DETECTOR

[Is it cheating they want to catch, or just to know what you do/say?]

A team of secondary-school students in New Zealand has created a mobile
phone detector for a business competition at their school, St. Thomas
of Canterbury College in Christchurch. The device, which the students
named CellTrac-r, can detect radio signals that cell phones use when
transmitting or receiving either calls or text messages. When activity
is detected, the device illuminates a series of lights that indicate
that activity and how far it is from the detector, which can monitor
distances up to 30 meters. Similar devices are currently available from
electronics makers, but the one developed by the students is
significantly less expensive than those available today. The students
have sold all 20 of the first batch they made, for NZ$39.95. Linda
Roberts of the University of Canterbury said she plans to test the
devices during university exams at the end of the year in an effort to
prevent students' cheating with cell phones. "People could be texting
away in an exam of 400 people and it would be hard to detect," said
Roberts. The devices will also be tested in a local prison to detect
unauthorized cell-phone usage within the prison.

REALNETWORKS MUSIC TO PLAY ON APPLE IPODS
RealNetworks has announced software that will make music downloads from
its online music store compatible with any portable media player,
including Apple Computer's iPod. Until now, RealNetworks music played
only on the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra MP3 player, and the iPod
has supported only digitally protected songs that carry restrictions on
their use and are purchased from Apple's iTunes Music Store. The new
Harmony software reportedly will make ReanNetworks songs compatible
with FairPlay, the digital rights management standard Apple uses to
protect songs from unauthorized copying.

BLOGGERS GET PRESS CREDENTIALS

[Will the Republicans do the same?]

Several dozen Web loggers have received press credentials to cover the
Democratic national political convention this year in Boston, and
organizers of the Republican convention in New York have said they
intend to issue credentials to 10 to 20 bloggers. The chosen bloggers
face a new situation in having access to primary sources for their
blogs rather than, per their usual practice, ferreting out information
from multiple sources or providing commentary based on news coverage of
events. The bloggers expect to cover niche issues and behind-the-scenes
events rather than the larger issues that typically attract the
mainstream news media. Some media experts have expressed reservations
about the shift in the definition of "journalist" to include bloggers,
arguing that journalists should be credentialed professionals.

More Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media


U.S. RAIL SYSTEM TRAINS RUNNING WITHOUT ENGINEERS ONBOARD

For at least the second time this month there has been a
remotely controlled train derailment involving hazardous
materials [HAZMAT].

Last night a remotely controlled Norfolk-Southern train
derailed in the St. Louis area near Alton, Illinois,
spilling hundreds of gallons of liquid fuel which HAZMAT
teams are cleaning up.  Norfolk-Southern refused comment.

I also called another prominent railroad line to find out
how many trains are run for what distances without anyone
on board, but got a long silence.  When I said "thank you"
and prepared to hang up, I was shuffled to a voicemail.

Just this past week, on July 22, it was revealed that the
Union Pacific derailment in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, on the 9th,
was also of a remote control train.

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET)
has made repeated warnings concerning these trains, without
apparent effect. [See BLET quote below]

Most of the publicity about these remote control trains is
designed to indicate they are used in railyard switching,
but the Union Pacific train was a full train, consisting
of over 100 cars, which ran through a Jonesboro, Arkansas
checkpoint and crashed into a hazardous materials train on
the main line, derailing 11 cars.

The remote control was being operated by two junior workers
hired only this year.

It would appear that the Union Pacific railroad did not report
the fact that the train was remote controlled to either the
National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] or local media,
which covered the accident.

A previous Union Pacific crash in Arlington, Texas involved a remote
control train that an eyewitness told the Ft. Worth Star Telegram
repeatedly rammed another train until it derailed right into the
path of another oncoming train.  A Union Pacific spokesperson told
the Star Telegram that the remote control operator was out of the
position in which he could that he was hitting anything.  Further
Union Pacific comments in the same article indicated that the fault
was "human error" not the fault of the remote control system,
as if repeated crashing would happen with an engineer on board.

There are failsafe devices installed to prevent these crashes,
but other researchers indicate these were overridden on purpose
to speed up the trains to increase profits.

Donald M. Hahs, National President of the BLET was quoted as saying,
"The railroads, which are the nations largest carrier of hazardous materials,
continue to take shortcuts with training employees, properly manning
locomotives, and implementing needed safety precautions."

TEFLON/SCOTCHGARD FOUND IN WILDLIFE AROUND OVER WORLD

Teflon and/or Scotchgard, while providing "non-stick" surfaces to keep
human homes and food cleaner, are turning out to be sticky commodities
in terms of the world's environment, from Polar Bears near the Arctic
to Japanese seabirds, and Mediterranean sea creatures.

These compounds, related to chorofluorocarbons such as Dupont's Freon,
are now being found in the the Great Lakes, which supplies the drinking
water for perhaps 10% of the U.S. and Canadian population.

SCIENTISTS LEAVING UNIVERSITIES

As governments continue denying economic recession and/or depressions,
the continuing cutbacks in grants are driving scientists out of their
academic settings and into the streets.

Most of these used to survive on salaries no better than the median,
not only spending four years as graduate researchers, but then yet
another four to eight years in various post-doctoral positions that
still have have salaries at about the median level.

Most of these would prefer to keep doing research, but with grants
and academics both becoming serious hassles, more and more of them
are heading out into the "real world."

One such example was Craig Venter, who rose to fame by re-entering
the Human Genome Project fray to set the world on its ear after 6
years of living as a surfer, but who rapidly eclipsed the work of
Nobel laureate James Watson, of Watson and Crick fame.

Experts admit that Venter's work was "spectacular" and that in his
efforts he took genetics to the next level, years ahead of where a
previous lock-step approach was being enforced by the governments
and academics.

It just makes you wonder how many more years we would be ahead if
Craig Venter had been encouraged, rather than held back for years
and then forced completely out of the system for 6 more years.
