Editorial

Hello,

An opportunity to voice your opinion this week in the PG website
design contest with some fine entries, I would recommend taking a look
just to see the quality of entries. A short newsletter this week -
sometimes real life just gets in the way, but expect a two part A to Z
starting next week on the letter 'T'.



Happy reading,

Alice

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

      If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
      the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
      following:

      1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
              http://gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
      which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
      http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

      2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
      working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
      years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
      for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
      progress" list:
              http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

      3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
      date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
      submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
      blank) to:
              http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

      You'll hear back within a few days.

-----------------

Also this week,

Many thanks to Steve Beach for setting up a bittorrent of the "Best of
Project Gutenberg" cd.

The bittorrent is hosted at http://www.thebeachfamily.org, and can be
downloaded at

http://www.thebeachfamily.org/torrents/status.html,

or, for the impatient, can be had at

http://www.thebeachfamily.org/torrents/PG2003-08.ISO.torrent.

-----------------

Just a reminder that, our very own Brett Fishburne has created a
Project Gutenberg group on the SETIhome website
(http://setiathome.berkeley.edu). Anyone interesting in using their
screensaver to search for aliens can go to the website, join the
effort and then JOIN THE GROUP! Brett informs me that there is now a
version of SETI for the MAC, so you have no excuse.
