Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
and *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

Project Gutenberg--Canada is now starting up!!!

Please let us know if you would like to volunteer!
Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,
and we have volunteers working on both of these.
We will also be seeking volunteers from others of
the "life +50" countries, as it looks as if the
Australian copyright law is falling victim to the
new "Economic Warfare" being waged by the World
Intellectual Property Organization and various
billionaire copyright holders around the world.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 25 weeks of this year, we have produced 2199 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 2199 eBooks!!!

          That's 25 WEEKS as Compared to ~29 YEARS!!!


With 13,106 eBooks online as of June 30, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.76 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.20 when we had 8352 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine ~13,106 books each costing ~$.45 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~13,106 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 13,106 eBooks in 32 Years and 11.80 Months We Averaged
       398 Per Year   [We do nearly that much a month these days!]
        33.0 Per Month
         1.09 Per Day

At 2199 eBooks Done In The 187 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      12 Per Day
      88 Per Week
     378 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

including telecommunications, electronics, etc.]

YAHOO LAUNCHES SEARCH ENGINE FOR CHINESE
Yahoo's China unit has launched a new search engine called 'Yisou,' or
No. 1 Search, tailored to Chinese users. "By combining the best assets of
our proprietary Yahoo Search Technology with our expertise and knowledge of
the Chinese online space, we created a dedicated search destination
customized for the Chinese user," Zhou Hongyi, general manager of Yahoo
China, says. Yahoo's announcement comes less than a week after rival Google
took a strategic stake in leading Chinese-language Internet search engine
Baidu.com. Baidu, China's most popular search engine, was dropped by Yahoo
on its Chinese-language website in March. (The Age 22 Jun 2004)

ASIA PACIFIC SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY TO GROW 27%
Gartner, the market and technology research company, is reporting that
the Asia Pacific semiconductor industry will grow at a world-fastest rate of
27.4% to reach $90.8 billion this year, fueled by demand in China. Over the
next four years, the industry is expected to average 14.3% annual growth to
be worth $138.8 billion, up from $71.3 billion in 2003. "Riding on the
positive wave created in 2003, the Asia Pacific semiconductor industry
is poised to propel the global semiconductor market to new heights,"
says Gartner Singapore-based analyst Philip Koh. "The rising demands
from the end-user industries are the key driving force.  China, the
electronic manufacturing hub of the world, is expected to continue
to lead the industry in the region." (The Age 22 Jun 2004)

NSW MAKES OPEN SOURCE MOVE
      The New South Wales government has made official its push into open
source technology, launching a $AU1.5 million deployment of what may be the
state's largest-ever rollout of open source software on the desktop. The
deployment of the open source office productivity suite represents a real
threat to Microsoft's dominance of the desktop through its Office package.
The government's Roads and Traffic Authority has already indicated its
preference for open standards by installing Apple's iMac G4 across the
registries earlier this year. The rollout will be a limited deployment of
the software, with a further commercial rollout to half the organization's
7000 desktops promised over the next few years. (The Australian 24 Jun 2004)

NETWORK VANDALS WANT TO BANK WITH YOU
Computer security experts are issuing warnings that network vandals
hope to steal the password and account information of online bank accounts
by secretly downloading spy software to capture a PC user's keystroke
activity. The problem is not widespread, but Internet Explorer users are being
advised to set the security setting for their browsers to "high" (a level
which, however, makes it more difficult to interact with some Web sites).

MICROSOFT'S BRAZIL LAWSUIT 'REPREHENSIBLE'
OSIA, Australia's Open Source industry body, has issued a scathing
criticism of Microsoft's lawsuit against Sergio Amadeu, President of the
Brazilian National Institute for Information Technology, calling it a
"reprehensible action" that attempts to "curb freedom of speech and of
criticism." The defamation lawsuit was filed after Amadeu defended the
Brazilian government's decision to shift 300,000 PCs from Windows to Linux.
He had said this decision "makes sense for a developing country where a mere
10% of the 170 million people have computers at home and where the
debt-laden government is the nation's biggest computer buyer." OSIA also
referred to Microsoft's "abuse" of its monopoly position, and Bill Gates's
address to university students in 1998, where he made a statement saying,
"Although about 3 million computers get sold every year in China, people
don't pay for the software. Someday they will, though. As long as they are
going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They'll get sort of addicted,
and then we'll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next
decade." (The Age, 24 Jun 2004)

AOL EMPLOYEE BUSTED FOR STEALING E-MAIL ADDRESSES
Jason Smathers, a 24-year-old employee of America Online, has been charged
with stealing the e-mail addresses of 92 million AOL customers and selling
them to spammers. Under a new federal anti-spam law, he faces the prospect
of as many as five years in prison plus a fine of $250,000. The stolen
information includes not only e-mail addresses but also telephone numbers,
Z*I*P codes and the type of credit card the customers use (though not the
actual credit card numbers, which are kept by AOL in a separate database).
The company says: "We deeply regret what has taken place and are thoroughly
reviewing and strengthening our internal procedures as a result
of this investigation and arrest."(New York Times 24 Jun 2004)

APPLE CHALLENGES MICROSOFT ON SEARCH TECHNOLOGY
Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs demoed an upcoming search feature
called Spotlight, which is based on the search technology used by Apple's
iTunes online music service. The feature will be incorporated into the next
version of Mac OS, called Tiger, which is slated for release in the first
half of 2005. Using technology designed to organize and search through song
collections, Spotlight can quickly find data stored on a hard drive
regardless of the type of file it is hidden in, says Jobs: "Search is a
problem for every personal computer company. It's easier to find a document
in a million pages on the Web using Google than it is to find a document on
your hard drive." Apple's intention to introduce roughly 150 new features
in Tiger indicates that Apple is "clearly going after [Microsoft's] Longhorn.
They're putting in a lot of features that will be in Longhorn, and that's
not coming out until 2006 or 2007," says Tim Bajarin, president of
Creative Strategies. "We think we are years ahead of Longhorn,"
concurs Jobs. "The other guys have been talking about it and we're doing it."

ASKJEEVES ADDS PAGE PREVIEW FEATURE
AskJeeves is adding a new preview feature that enables users to sneak
a peek at thumbnail images of the Web pages displayed in results. (The
feature works only when used with Windows/Internet Explorer.) "It
eliminates the need to go pogo-sticking around the Web to decide where you
want to go," says Jeeves senior VP Jim Lanzone, who notes in user testing,
the preview feature reduced the number of clicks used by searchers by 50%
to 70%. Although the images are tiny, they still are large enough to convey
an idea of the Web site's focus. Jeeves is also adding new shortcuts
designed to enhance user experience. For instance, after the user types in
a famous person's name, Jeeves displays a box at the top of the results
page with a minibio, photo and links to Web resources. If the user types in
a movie title, the search engine pops up a synopsis of the film and what
proportion of professional film critics liked it.

NEW RECORD SET FOR TEXT-MESSAGING SPEED
Singapore student Kimberly Yeo, 23, has walked away with first place
in a contest designed to test text messaging speed and dexterity after she
managed to type a fiendishly complicated 26-word text message on her cell
phone in 43.66 seconds, says competition organizer Singapore
Telecommunications. The record beats by a significant margin the previous
time of 67 seconds set last year by Briton James Trusler in Sydney,
Australia. Contestants had to type, "The razor-toothed piranhas of the
genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish
in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human." Like many of her
fellow contestants, Yeo is an avid text-messager, sending about 50 a day,
or 1,500 a month. Singapore Telecom says its system now handles about 9
million text messages a day, up from 3.5-4 million in 2001-2002.

REVISION TO DMCA GAINS SUPPORT
Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, this week endorsed a bill that would amend the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to allow for broader fair-use access.
The bill, known as the Digital Media Consumer's Rights Act, was
introduced more than 18 months ago but has been stalled ever since.
Barton's support could see the bill marked up in July and possibly
passed before the end of the current Congressional session. An
anonymous Senator will reportedly introduce the legislation to the
Senate if it has sufficient backing in the House. The bill would allow
users to circumvent digital copy-protection measures if the purpose
falls within the scope of traditional fair use. Currently, the DMCA
prohibits such circumvention. The bill would also allow companies to
develop and market tools that bypass digital copy protections if those
tools are capable of significant noninfringing use.

ISPS AGREE ON ANTISPAM MEASURES
Four of the largest e-mail providers have agreed to work collectively
on sender-authentication technologies to limit the flow of spam.
Despite saying more than a year ago that they would cooperate on such
an undertaking, America Online, Yahoo, EarthLink, and Microsoft have
been working on separate approaches to the challenge of screening out
e-mail that does not come from its purported source. In May, however,
Microsoft announced it would combine its technology, called Caller ID,
with that of America Online and EarthLink, called Sender Policy
Framework (SPF), and name it Sender ID. Meanwhile, Yahoo has been
developing a technology called Domain Keys, which is potentially more
effective but requires more work to implement. The four companies
announced this week they would test each other's technologies, paving
the way for a coordinated effort to block spam.

AOL BUYS ONLINE DIRECT MARKETER ADVERTISING.COM

[Following in Google's Finanical Path to More Advertizing]

America Online has agreed to purchase online direct marketer
Advertising.com for $435 million in an attempt to obtain a new source
of advertising revenue. The acquisition gives AOL a direct presence in
the high-growth sector of online advertising called
pay-for-performance, in which advertisers pay for an ad only if it
yields results. The company's previous exposure to this model was
through its revenue-sharing agreement with search-engine company
Google. In the past, AOL has focused mainly on advertising revenue
based on the number of people who viewed an ad. Advertising.com charges
clients when customers click on an ad or take another type of action.
The company purchases ad banners on thousands of Web sites for its
clients. AOL plans to let Advertising.com operate independently,
according to AOL Chief Executive Jonathan F. Miller.

AOL E-MAIL ADDRESSES SOLD TO SPAMMERS
An American Online engineer has been charged with stealing e-mail
addresses of AOL customers and selling them to spammers. An e-mail list
broker for spammers was also arrested. Both are charged with violating
the new federal antispam law, which took effect January 1. The two men
face a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and a fine of
$250,000 (or twice the gross gain or loss from their actions).
According to the charges, the enginner used the identity of another AOL
employee to gain access to the list of addresses. The list included the
e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, Z*I*P codes, and type of credit
cards used by each AOL member. The credit card numbers are kept in a
separate database.

More Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media


NEW U.S. MEDICARE DRUG CARD HAVING TROUBLE WITH LIFTOFF

The U.S. goverment says only 3.5 million are now enrolled
for the new Medicare/Senior Citizen Drug Card, as opposed
to the 8 million predicted, and apparently not all of the
3.5 million were voluntary or intentional subscribers, as
many of them were subscribed by their health programs.

This is in spite of the fact there will be some additional
charges than the $30 for the card for those who do not add
the card to their health coverage repertoire during a kind
of "introductory period."

The major reasons for people not buying the cards are:

1.  Their current medical services will not talk about the
Drug Cards, saying that they are goo complex, disorganized
and difficult to deal with:  this includes doctors, nurses
and pharmacists, as well as various medical administration
personnel.

2.  Each card can cover different drugs, so certain of the
prescribed combinations will not be covered.

3.  You can't change cards when you choose, only at a time
to be specified from time to time by the government, while
the companies supplying the cards can change that coverage
without consideration as to when users can change cards.

The Drug Card programs may change the drugs they support,
but users will be stuck with the card until the next time
an option to change cards happens without being able to
get the prescribed drugs via the Drug Card.  You must only
choose ONE of the various drug cards, even if none of them
cover the drugs or combinations prescribed for you.

Some medical plans will be better than using any Drug Card
but it's not easy to find out without searching through an
assortment of records of the various companies to see what
drugs are carried by which companies.

Even the experts agree that it takes THEM an large effort
over an undue period of time to make such a determination
and that all that homework could be wiped out by an early
change in the coverage provided.  There is the widespread
concern that allowing the companies to change coverage at
different times than their members can change companies is
an invitation to the "bait and switch" tactics which are
illegal in other forms of business.
