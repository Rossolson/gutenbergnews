The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, April 28, 2004  PT1
*****eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since July 4, 1971******

This Newsletter is being completed and sent from our backup locations
as beryl.ils.unc.edu is down.  Thus the numbers are probably a little
lower than they should be, as the listings of the new eBooks are sent
through a beryl listserver.  Before beryl went down, we were up to a
weekly total of 84 new eBooks, so I am going with 85, as below, and I
will do my best to make sure we properly reconcile next week's number
with this.  Apologies for any confusion this causes.  The rest of the
Newsletter should be up to date, as I retrieved Newsscan and Edupage
articles from our backup email sites.


*Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org*
*Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com*

                        7514 to go to 20,000



It took 32 years from 1971 to 2003 to do our 1st 10,000

[The Newsletter is now being sent in two sections, so you can directly
go to the portions you find most interesting:  1.  Founder's Comments,
News, Notes & Queries, and  2. Weekly eBook Update Listing.]

Today, and until we actually GET a new Newsletter editor who want to
do another portion, there will be only 2 parts. . .this is Part 1,
and the eBook listings in Part 2 [New Project Gutenberg Documents].

[Since we are between Newsletter editors, these 2 parts may undergo a
few changes while we are finding a new Newsletter editor.   Email us:
hart@pobox.com and gbnewby@pglaf.org if you would like to volunteer.]


  This is Michael Hart's "Founder's Comments" section of the Newsletter

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
an *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby <gbnewby AT pglaf.org> ,

This is much more important than many of us realize!


*** Progress Report

    In the first 3.75 months of this year, we produced 1579 new eBooks.

 It took us from July 1971 to Jan 1999 to produce our first 1,579 eBooks!

                That's 16 WEEKS as Compared to ~28 Years!

                   85   New eBooks This Week
                   75   New eBooks Last Week
                  164   New eBooks This Month [April]

                  421   Average Per Month in 2004
                  355   Average Per Month in 2003
                  203   Average Per Month in 2002
                  103   Average Per Month in 2001

                 1579   New eBooks in 2004

                 ====
                 9424   New eBooks Since Start Of 2001
                             That's Only 39.75 Months!

               12,486  Total Project Gutenberg eBooks
                7,743   eBooks This Week Last Year
                 ====
                4,743   New eBooks In Last 12 Months

                  350   eBooks From Project Gutenberg of Australia


We're still keeping up with Moore's Law!

I think the figures below are slightly high,
since we did EXACTLY 1,000 eBooks by the 3rd
week in April last year, and this year 1579.
This is just about exactly 100% Moore's Law.


Moore's Law 12 month percentage = 104%

Moore's Law 18 month percentage = 101%

[100% of Moore's Law = doubling every 18 months]


Check out our website at gutenberg.net, and see below to learn how
you can get INSTANT access to our eBooks via FTP servers even before
the new eBooks listed below appear in our catalog.

eBooks are posted throughout the week.  You can even get daily lists.

*** Continuing Requests For Assistance:

Project Gutenberg--Canada will be starting up soon.
Please let us know if you would like to volunteer!
Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,
and we have volunteers working on both of these.
We will also be seeking volunteers from others of
the "life +50" countries, as it looks as if the
Australian copyright law is falling victim to the
new "Economic Warfare" being waged by the World
Intellectual Property Organization and various
billionaire copyright holders around the world.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 16 weeks of this year, we have produced 1579 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our FIRST 1579 eBooks!!!

         That's 16 WEEKS as Compared to ~28 YEARS!!!


With 12,486 eBooks online as of April 28, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.80 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.29 when we had 7666 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine ~12,500 books each costing ~$.49 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~12,500 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 12,486 eBooks in 32 Years and 9.75 Months We Averaged
      380 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       31.7 Per Month
        1.04 Per Day

At 1579 eBooks Done In The 112 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
     14 Per Day
     99 Per Week
    421 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

>From Newsscan:

[As With Previous eBook Hardware, It Will Cost A Fortune To Download Public
Domain eBooks, As There Appears To Be No Provision For Free eBook Entry AND
it also appears that users will only be RENTING the $5 eBooks, as they seem
to be only be readable for 8 weeks or so after downloading.  More later.]

SONY E-BOOK GETS RAVE REVIEWS
Sony's Librii electronic reader is as easy on the eyes as the paper version,
says New York Times reviewer Todd Zaun. The Librii screen is a collaborative
effort between Philips Electronics and E Ink, and the letters appear
"as sharp and clear as those on a printed page. The screen can be
read from almost any angle, and it does not fade in bright light,"
says Zaun. Sony plans to begin selling the Librii in Japan next month
for about $380, and buyers will be able to download e-books for less than
$5 each from a Web site set up by Sony and a group of Japanese publishers.
Sony plans to see how its Japanese market develops before it decides whether
to expand to the U.S. and Europe. (New York Times 22 Apr 2004)

LINDOWS SET FOR IPO
Lindows Inc. has filed for a so-called Dutch-auction-style initial
public offering in an effort to raise up to $57.5 million. In a
Dutch-auction IPO, investors bid on shares and help set the offering price.
Lindows, which markets a version of Linux software for personal computers,
was founded by Michael L. Robertson, the entrepreneur who also founded
MP3.com. Lindows has locked horns with Microsoft, which has filed lawsuits
alleging that the Lindows name violates Microsoft trademarks on the Windows
operating system. In response, Lindows changed the name of its software to
Linspire last week. (Wall Street Journal 21 Apr 2004)

AUSTRALIAN BANKS LOOK AT LINUX SWITCH
Linux and open-source software have a big future - at Microsoft's
expense - in at least two of Australia's four big banks. Westpac and the
National Australia Bank are seriously considering open source, and the ANZ
Bank has yet to show its cards. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth Bank has
decided to stick with Microsoft products. Westpac and NAB are evaluating
Linux on the desktop, as well as open-source alternatives for their
back-end IT operations. That could lead to pockets of desktops running
open-source software, perhaps in ATM or teller environments and many
back-end systems, including internet-banking platforms running on Linux.

INDIA IMPLEMENTS E-VOTING
For decades, millions of illiterate Indians voted by pressing their
thumbprints on ballot cards. This year, they'll just press a button --
and so will everyone else. India's general elections, which began Tuesday,
are set to make the world's largest democracy also the world's largest user
of computerized voting machines. This year, in a staggered vote that runs
through May 10, India's 660 million registered voters will be able to
exercise their franchise on one of approximately 1 million computerized
voting machines in an electronic, ballot-less election. The change in India
is having a deep impact on politics. Supporters say it's also good for the
environment in a country trying to save its vanishing forests. More than
8,000 tons of paper, made from approximately 16 million trees, has been used
to print ballots for past federal elections. (The Australian 22 Apr 2004)

MD. GROUP DEMANDS PAPER BACKUP FOR E-VOTES
A voter advocacy group in Maryland is suing that state's Board of
Elections to prevent the use of touch-screen voting machines until a paper
record is installed as auditable backup for the system. At present, the
state's Diebold voting machines are not set up to produce a paper record of
each individual vote. Linda H. Lamone, the state elections administrator,
says that  paper records are unnecessary because the Diebold system is
equipped to preserve votes in its memory: "It's stored in two different
locations. If we have battery failure, it still doesn't lose votes." She
also said: "It's going to be next to impossible for anyone to gain access to
manipulate the election. If anyone tries it, we're going to put them in
jail." (Washington Post 22 Apr 2004)

small guy can eventually beat a huge company. Hopefully, this leads to
better care, custody and control over people's intellectual property," says
Gary Kremen, who originally registered the name but found in 1995 that
Network Solutions had turned the rights over to convicted forger Stephen
Michael Cohen, who duped the Internet registrar into believing he had
purchased it from Kremen. A federal court in 2001 ordered Cohen to pay
Kremen $65 million, but Cohen skipped the country and is rumored to be
living in Monte Carlo. Kremen then set his sights on VeriSign, which had
purchased Network Solutions in 2000 and refused to admit any mistake had
been made. The company is embroiled in nine other lawsuits over problems
with domain-name registrations, according to the company's most recent
annual filing with the SEC. (Los Angeles Times 21 Apr 2004)

FINGERPRINT TECHNOLOGY IN OHIO SCHOOLS
The Akron, Ohio school district has begun using a $700,000 "iMeal"
program that identifies students in school lunch lines using their
fingerprints. Students whose parents don't want them fingerprinted can
instead be issued a PIN number to participate in the school lunch program.
The coordinator of Akron's Child Nutrition Services says, "It's a parental
and student choice what to do. We don't encourage or discourage either
option." Whether students use fingerprints or PIN numbers, they'll be able
to pay as they go through the lunch line or draw from a prepaid account.

WANT ATTENTION? DRIVE THROUGH MANALAPAN, FLORIDA
Manalapan, Florida, where two out of every three homes are worth more
than $500,000, will soon be running background checks on every car and
driver that passes through town. Cameras will take infrared photos recording
a car's tag number, and computer software will automatically run the numbers
through law enforcement databases; police will also have a picture of the
driver, taken with another set of cameras. A Manalapan police official says,
"Courts have ruled that in a public area, you have no expectation of
privacy." In any event, the official makes a point of saying that the data
collected this way will be destroyed every three months.

COMCAST WALKS AWAY FROM THE TABLE
Withdrawing his company's unsolicited bid to take over the Walt Disney
Company, Comcast president and CEO Brian L. Roberts explains: "We have always
been disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. Being disciplined means
knowing when it is time to walk away. That time is now. It has become clear
that there is no interest on the part of Disney's management and Board in
putting Comcast and Disney together. As a result, we have withdrawn our offer."

MICROSOFT EXTENDS CONCESSIONS
In a surprise announcement, Microsoft said it will allow competing
software companies to license its technology beyond the term required
by Microsoft's antitrust settlement with the government. One of the
major requirements of the settlement was that Microsoft allow
competitors access to its technology so that those other firms could
develop software that would work properly with the Windows operating
system, thereby spurring competition in the software market. Only 14
companies, however, have bought licenses to use Microsoft technology in
developing their own applications. Responding to comments from the
judge in the case that the settlement has not shown the results
anticipated, Microsoft said it will continue the licensing program
until November 2009, two years longer than the settlement requires.
Microsoft also said it will allow access to some portions of its
next-generation operating system, known as Longhorn.

More Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media


COLLEGE TUITION OUTSTRIPPING INFLATION 10 TIMES OVER

As per a radio news program this morning, one of our regional colleges
is raising tuition today by 16% for incoming students, and 7.5% for
continuing students.

At 16%, this is 10 times the U.S. Inflation rate of 1.6% (2002)
Source: 2003 CIA World Factbook


It will only take 5 more 16% tuition hikes to double tuition.

We've already had several such tuition hikes reported.

CHINESE PUSHING FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS GRID

The Chinese government has decided to postpone indefinitely a plan
that would have imposed its own standard for wireless technology.
[This allows for the export of U.S. wireless technologies.]

Evans said of the Chinese decision: "It is certainly a landmark day --
a fruitful day in the relationship between the United States and China.
Our exports to China are growing faster than exports to any other country
in the world."

The headlines were misleading in the original:

[I'm still working on more information for you on this subject]
[Yes, there is more this week]

I've been researching and reporting on "Stereolithography" or 3-D
printing for about 10 years, and still have very little in the way
of press coverage of a pretty exciting computer application. . .
"printing" actual 3-D objects from your computer.

[Here'e The Latest On The 3-D Computer Age, And, Again, Note They
Don't Mention How These 3-D Parts Actually Get Into The Real World]

3D SEARCHING
Researchers have developed new search engines that can mine catalogs of
three-dimensional objects such as airplane parts or architectural features.
For example, Purdue University professor Karthik Ramani created a system
that can find computer-designed industrial parts, and Caterpillar Inc.
engineer Rick Jeff says of Ramani's technology: "If you've got to design a
new elbow for an oil line, more often than not, we have a plethora of
elbows"; Jeff says the problem has been that each has to be examined
separately -- a tedious task "that isn't even performed that often, because
it isn't feasible or practical... It seems like there's ever-greater demands
for speed in product development, and it's those kinds of breakthroughs that
are needed to keep up. This would really just add to the efficiency."
Professor Ramani says happily: "I think this is the beginning of the
information age." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 16 Apr 2004)
