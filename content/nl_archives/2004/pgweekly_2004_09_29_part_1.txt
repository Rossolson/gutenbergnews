Coltan : A commentary from Bill Hammack's public radio program
You can listen to this commentary at http://www.engineerguy.com

Recently, I picked up a book about spices, although it was really
a geopolitical history. It focused on a tiny Indonesian island
that became, in the 17th century, a battle ground for the English
and the Dutch, with, of course, the natives caught in the middle.
They all wanted the nutmeg that grew there.  In the 17th century,
a man could sell a small sack of nutmeg for enough to build a
large house and then retire there in comfort. The value of nutmeg
came partly because of its rarity, but also because Europeans
thought it had powerful medicinal qualities. So, for two
centuries the English and Dutch battled over the Island,
decimating it in the process.

At first, when I read of these "nutmeg" wars, I thought how
quaint that the European economy should depend on spices from
obscure parts of the world. Yet, by the time I finished the book,
I realized that my own world operates in exactly the same way.

The electronic network that I live in - my computer, cell phone,
and pager - depend on something call Coltan. Spelled C-O-L-T-A-N,
it's as magic to us as nutmeg was to a 17th century European.

Coltan looks like black mud. It's name is a contraction of
columbium and tantalum. And it's that tantalum that's important
to our world. A gray-blue, very hard metal, it's the key element
[in the] called a pinhead capacitor. These electrical devices regulate
the voltage and store energy in cell phones, pagers, and computers.
In the last few years alone, tens of millions of these
tantalum-filled capacitors were manufactured.

Coltan is found in three billion year old soil, like that of the
Rift Valley in Africa, which contains eighty percent of the
world's supply. And, of the eighty percent, the majority is in
the region.

And much like the nutmeg of the 17th century, Coltan has brought
ruin to the Congo. It has made the area attractive to neighboring
countries, and Coltan has been a key force in accelerating the
civil war within the Congo. By some estimates, these
resource-based wars have killed about five million people, and
displaced another ten million or so.

No doubt, some generation after us will evolve past cell phones
and pagers, and will no longer need to run their world with the
tantalum that comes in the magic mud coltan. And, no doubt, they
will look back at the coltan wars and think them as quaint as the
"nutmeg" wars of the 17th century. The message is clear: As we
use our cell phones today, we should remember those nutmeg wars,
and keep a careful eye on how our technological systems affects
the world.

To use George Santayana's aphorism: "Those who cannot remember
the past are condemned to repeat it."

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 7.5 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 38 weeks of this year, we have produced 2984 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 2984 eBooks!!!

          That's 38 WEEKS as Compared to ~30 YEARS!!!


With 13,891 eBooks online as of September 29, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.72 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.04 when we had 9583 eBooks a year ago

Can you imagine ~13,891 books each costing ~$.32 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~13,891 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 13,891 eBooks in 33 Years and 02.80 Months We Averaged
       418 Per Year   [We do nearly that much a month these days!]
        34.8 Per Month
         1.14 Per Day

At 2984 eBooks Done In The 272 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11.0 Per Day
      76.7 Per Week
     339.1 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.


                            *Flashback!!!

                   2754 New eBooks So Far in 2004

               It took us ~30 years for the first 2654 !

       That's the 7.75 months of 2004 as Compared to ~30 years!!!

      Here Is A Sample Of What Books Were Being Done Around #2754

>From NewsScan:


TESTS SHOW CELL PHONES DON'T DISRUPT NAVIGATION SYSTEMS

[For all those who thought it was always just a conspiracy to keep
people on planes out of touch with the rest of the world. . . .]
[BTW, a doctor told me the same thing about the signs in doctor's
offices to turn off cell phones. . .says only the most primitive
phones and medical equipment from decades ago had any interference.]

Recent tests by Airbus and American Airlines/Qualcomm indicate that,
contrary to popular lore, cellular signals do not disrupt airplanes'
navigational systems. The two results were similar for both the CDMA and
GSM cellular technologies, but the Federal Aviation Administration and the
Federal Communications Commission say the tests can't officially be considered
in their review of the rules because they were conducted without government
oversight. The agencies say they are moving ahead with their own tests.

SONY EMBRACES MP3 FORMAT

[Sony learns faster than most. . .perhaps someday these companies
will just totally STOP introducing those silly proprietary formats.]

In a strategic shift, Sony announced it will add support for MP3
files to some of its portable music players, enabling it to compete
directly against rivals such as Apple Computer, whose portable players
support MP3 and other file formats. A Sony spokeswoman says new flash-based
players with both MP3 and Atrac (Sony's proprietary format) playback will
appear as early as this year in Europe, but it's unclear when those players
will hit the shelves in the U.S. (AP/Washington Post 23 Sep 2004)

DOES IM MEAN 'INSTANT MUSIC'?
Yahoo's purchase of Musicmatch last week for $160 million in cash has
raised speculation that it plans to use the acquisition to enable Yahoo
Messenger users to share and interact with one another's digital playlists.
"The whole advantage that (Yahoo) has is using its broad reach to push
products and integrate them," says one source close to the deal. Meanwhile,
Microsoft acknowledges that it's planning to do just that with its MSN
Messenger and MSN Music services. In fact, MSN Messenger has already
quietly begun experimenting with music playlist sharing using a test
application called ThreeDegrees. The strategy gives Web portals a leg up in
their pursuit of the online music market, currently dominated by Apple's
iTunes. And adding more functionality to instant messaging is part of their
master plan to transform IM from a simple chatting tool to a control panel
for multimedia applications. (CNet News.com 22 Sep 2004)

LIVING LIFE WITHOUT A NET
Paid $725 or more for their participation, [a] dozen families in the
Northeast, Midwest and Northwest recently gave up the Internet for two weeks
as part of a study by Yahoo and advertising firm OMD to demonstrate the
emotional connection people have to the Net. The results? One participant
admits, "I didn't realize how tough it would be," and reports that he missed
online news and weather, door-to-door driving directions and e-mail. Some
participants had to rediscover such things as the Yellow Pages, TV,
newspapers and movies. In general, the study found that participants felt
lost and disconnected (both literally and figuratively).

IMAGES BEARING VIRUSES: DO YOU GET THE PICTURE?
Security experts are saying it's possible for network vandals to use a
flaw in Microsoft Windows XP and Server 2003 systems to embed viruses into
digital photos, thereby infecting vulnerable PCs. Marcus Sachs, director of
the SANS Internet Storm Center, warns: "We always said there's no way you
can be infected just by looking at a photograph online, but now it looks
like we may have to eat our words on that. This year we've seen a lot of
changes to the fundamental ways we thought we were secure." Microsoft users
can download the latest patches from the company's Windows Update site.

IBM TAG TEAM
Microsoft will be hiring 1,000 new employees and spending $250 million
over five years to develop a new business unit to support products and
services related to radio tags and sensor networks for inventory management.
Radio tags can be read in groups, hold far more data than bar codes, and
show when and where particular items were made and where they're being
shipped to. They don't need batteries, because they receive enough energy to
communicate from signals sent by the reader. Analysts such as Navi Radjou of
Forrester Research think the challenge for IBM and other companies is to
provide a road map laying out small steps toward deployment of radio-tagging
and other sensor technologies, because "people won't do big-bang
implementations." (New York Times 27 Sep 2004)

GOOGLE OMITS RESULTS FROM SITES BANNED BY CHINA
Google's news service in China omits results from Web sites blocked by
the government, according to Dynamic Internet Technology Inc., a research
firm fighting online censorship. Tests by Dynamic found that Google omits
results from the banned sites when search requests are made through
computers connecting to the Internet in China. Google acknowledges that its
Chinese language service is ignoring results from government-banned sites,
but says it does so in order to make its search engine efficient and to
shield computer users from clicking on links that lead nowhere. A Google
executive says, "Google has decided that in order to create the best
possible search experience for our mainland China users we will not include
sites whose content is not accessible." Forrester Research analyst Charlene
Li sympathizes with the company's predicament: "It's probably killing them
to leave some sites out of its index, but they have probably decided they
are doing greater good by providing access to all these other sites."

iPODS ON THE HIT LIST
They're ubiquitous and have changed the way we listen to music but
iPods are proving to be a high-tech security risk. The Australian Department
of Defense has followed the lead of Britain's Ministry of Defense in banning
the use of iPods -- which have large storage capabilities and can be used to
siphon information from computers -- in specific defense areas. An
Australian government official explains, "The threat from iPods is
considered the same as for all other forms of easily portable storage media.
The use of such media and associated devices, or their presence within
defense areas, is strictly controlled and in some cases prohibited." In
July, Britain's Defense Ministry added the Apple music accessory to a list
of devices banned in most sections of its UK headquarters and offices
abroad. The fear is that devices with large storage capabilities and those
with a USB (universal serial bus) plug can be a useful tool for data
thieves. (The Age 25 Sep 2004) Rec''d from J. Lamp

MICROSOFT SUES SPAMMERS
Microsoft has filed nine new lawsuits against spammers, and is now
involved in more than 100 legal anti-spam cases throughout the world. The
latest lawsuit is against Web hosting company National Online Sales and its
owner Levon Gillespie, who offer "bulletproof" services for those seeking to
send marketing e-mail. Aaron Kornblum, an attorney for Microsoft, says:
"This is the first action against a Web host catering to spammers." His
rationale for the suit is that National Online Sales and Gillespie are
providing "a safe place for spammers to drive customers to."

CONCERN GROWS OVER JPEG FLAW
Some security experts are warning users that a recently announced flaw
in the way some Microsoft applications handle JPEG images could lead to
the next large-scale virus infection. David Perry of anti-virus firm
Trend Micro noted that the combination of several factors has his firm
especially worried about the JPEG flaw. Those factors, Perry said,
include the number of applications that are affected by the flaw--more
than a dozen--and the fact that there has not been a significant virus
attack for some time, which may have the effect of lowering users'
attention to preventive measures. When the flaw was announced, no code
had yet appeared that exploited it. Within the past week, however, such
code has been written and has appeared on a private mailing list and a
public Web site. Perry characterized the current situation as "the
virus equivalent of a harmonic convergence." Others were not as worried
about the threat posed by the flaw. Graham Cluley of anti-virus firm
Sophos noted that so far no malicious code is being delivered using the
flaw. "It is purely being done as a 'proof of concept,'" said Cluley.

More Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media

NEW SAT ESSAY PORTION FOCUSES MORE ON STYLE THAN CONTENT

Schools and students are flocking to either take the SAT
tests before March to avoid the change to handwriting as
opposed to only content oriented scoring, while those in
a position to only take the test later are practicing on
their handwriting like mad, according to various reports
I have heard and seen regarding the 2005 SAT [Scholastic
Aptitude Test, now owned by College Board testing.]

Decades ago research indicated that a typewritten paper,
this was before the computer age, was much easier for an
academic evaluator to read and grade, and would also get
a higher grade, even though the content was the same.

In 2005 we will apparently be taking a giant step back--
to the days where penmanship was more important than the
ability to type, when the pen was mightier than the PC.

All Things Considered reported on September 27, that the
school system's "New Generation Takes Up Cursive Writing"
and Robert Siegel watched as Bel Air, Maryland, students
went back to the basics of formal handwriting, something
had previously been going the way of the dinosaur as the
computer had become the tool of choice for writing.

Testing on analogies and quantitative comparison are now
being de-emphasized, as are the reading passages, all in
decline in the new 2005 version of the SAT, which vamped
and revamped itself in the last few years, setting up an
alternative new scoring system I reported on earlier.

That scoring system was in response to the fact that the
standarized tests such as the SAT and ACT [The "American
College Testing" brand] scores had finally fallen so far
that this could no longer be ignored.

Of course, the solution was to revamp the scoring, not a
solution to improve the U.S. educational system.  [There
have been several comments mentioning that many a recent
winner of national awards has been homeschooled; include
both last year's National Spelling Bee winner and runner
up in that category, not to mention several earlier.]

Without even a single decade to evaluate and refine that
new scoring system, the SATs are already going through a
new face lift that further removes today's scores from a
historical perspective that previously dated to WWII.

To those who say none of "1984" never happened, I submit
that these are merely a few examples out of thousands.


FLORIDA SCHOOLS CLOSED, BUT FOOTBALL IS STILL A PRIORITY

Many students in Florida are still out of school, due to
the effects of recent hurricane damage, but the football
team is still going out for practice, as what has been a
major effort at a "return to normalcy."


RFIDs NOW TRACKING CHILDREN AT THEME PARKS

RFIDs [Radio Frequency IDentification tags] are now used
to keep track of your kids when they go to theme parks--
I guess you can just go to a "lost and found" and see on
the computer screen where they are.

Previous uses have been to keep track of school children
in Japan, public officials in South America, and inmates
in prisons, as well as for the County Dog Catcher to get
a head start on those hard to catch dogs.

This may be the first use not mandated by some officials
of the various government agencies involved, at least as
far as the tracking of living beings is concerned.

Wal-Mart is reported to be putting RFIDs on every single
piece of merchandise in their stores, so watch out if an
item you are carrying gets out of your possession, their
computers may realize this and have someone bring it out
to the checkout counter as you are leaving.

[Speaking of those Japanese school kids. . . .]

JAPANESE KIDS TRACKED BY RADIO CHIPS

[No more saying, "They didn't let me out until an hour ago."]

Some schools in Japan are testing a system in which tiny antennae are
attached to student backpacks or clothes so the students can be traced by
radio. Public school teacher Ichiro Ishihara says, "More than 70 percent of
parents supported the trials, indicating there is wide appreciation for this
kind of effort. And the kids love it -- they think it's cool." There has also
begun the testing in Japan of a system that will allow messages to be sent to
parents' cell phones so they know what time their children left school.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has published a new survey, which looks
at how Americans spend their time.

See http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf.

"Reading as a primary [leisure] activity varied greatly by age.  The
oldest age group [65 and older] averaged an hour of reading per day,
while the youngest [15 to 24] averaged about 8 minutes."  The overall
average is .33 hours/day (about 19 minutes) for men, and .40 hours/day
(about 24 minutes) for women.



*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

TV ADS REDUCED DURING PREMIERES

While I was watching the season premiere of a television show
this week, I noticed something odd. . .no commercials, no ads.
Nothing on that order until 21 minutes into the show, so I did
a little note taking and found the ads to have been placed at:

21 mins
34 mins
45 mins
54 mins

thus giving show viewing segments of:

21 mins
10 mins
  8 mins
  6 mins

for a total of 45 minutes of show, when the usual time given
for programs has now "Honey, I shrunk the TV shows" down to
only about 40 minutes on the average day.  Thus we got 3/4
show and 1/4 commercials during the premiere, and none at
all for the first 1/3+ of the show, rather than the usual
2/3 show and 1/3 commercials.

Yes, we usually get only about 40 minutes of programming
per 60 minutes on the clock.

For those keeping score at home, you might want to try it,
and you will notice that once they have you hooked on the
show, they put in more and more ads as the show goes on.

If you buy any of the old shows, you will notice they have
52 minutes of show and only 8 minutes of commercials.  The
commercial breaks used to be 2 minutes long and usually in
two equally spaced segments per half hour show, and those
"stations breaks" really WERE there for your local station
to have a few seconds to identify themselves, let you hear
the beep telling you the exact time, etc.

I did the same note taking process with one of the popular
daytime talk shows, and got 60 ads in one hour, obviously
most of them took less than 30 seconds, or you would not
be able to get much of the show on.

Some shows now even interrupt themselves to give ads for
something happening later in the show. . .and I do NOT
mean ye old technique of saying "NEXT, see this," when
you KNOW whatever it is will definitely NOT BE NEXT!!!

No, I see shows now putting in little previews of parts
of that show that are coming, and I don't mean just the
talk shows, who have some reason to let you know how an
idea is going to be pursued, but I mean sit-coms, etc.

All this puts less and less program and more and more
promotional material on your television.

I admit, that _I_ consider "watch this show later" to
be advertizing, even though the television executives
will try to get them counted in the same slot as some
of the PSA's or Public Service Announcements, which I
notice have now been nearly completely relegated from
normal hours to those times I only watch when I found
sleep to be very elusive.

I won't even go into how I felt the first time I woke
up to advertizing during the previews at the movies--
or various kinds of "product placement," etc.

Even PBS and NPR, which used to have NO advertizing--
only a few seconds of the name of the sponsors in the
whole hour of programming now end their programs five
minutes before the hour, just like the networks we've
always been accustomed to, and fill that time with an
assortment of ads for products, companies and shows--
now I even hear "breaks" in the interview programs in
order to give yet even more time for advertizing on a
show that claims to be "non-commercial."

I wonder what I will do the next time I am invited on
one of those "non-commercial" shows?

Will I insist that there NOT be advertizing connected
with my presence on their programs?
