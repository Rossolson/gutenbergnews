There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, eg.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

We are in the process of rewriting some of the general FAQs and
would appreciate help proofreading them over the next few months.

We've added some new FAQs and generally updated information
about Project Gutenberg.  Take a look, and email Michael or
Greg with any suggestions or corrections.  We'll have these
updated from time to time, now that we've passed #10,000.
A new set of these will be in the works when we pass #20,000.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 14 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 44 weeks of this year, we have produced 3577 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3577 eBooks!!!

          That's 44 WEEKS as Compared to ~31.5 YEARS!!!


Here's a sample of what books we were doing around eBook #3577

Dec 2002 Private Life of Napoleon, V1, by Constant  [NB#18][nc01vxxx.xxx] 3568
Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte, Complete, by Bourrienne                    3567
Dec 2002 Memoirs of Napoleon, V16, by Bourrienne    [NB#16][nb16vxxx.xxx] 3566
[Two multivolume sets of Napoleon.]


With 14,484 eBooks online as of November 24, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.69 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $.96 when we had 10,069 eBooks a year ago

Can you imagine ~14,484 books each costing ~$.27 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~14,484 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 14,484 eBooks in 33 Years and 04.75 Months We Averaged
       434 Per Year   [We do about 3/4 that much per month these days!]
        36.1 Per Month
         1.19 Per Day

At 3577 eBooks Done In The 335 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11 Per Day
      78 Per Week
     334 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.


                            *Flashback!!!

                   3334 New eBooks So Far in 2004

               It took us ~31 years for the first 3324 !

       That's the 9.75 months of 2004 as Compared to ~31 years!!!



*Headline News from NewsScan and Edupage

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


>From NewsScan:

BROADBAND USE UP, BUT U.S. STILL LAGS FAR BEHIND

[In a related story, AOL has indicated it will cease providing broadband
service in in the entire southeastern United States in January.]

A Bush administration report, titled "A Nation Online: Entering the
Broadband Age," notes that the number of Americans using broadband Internet
connections doubled between 2001 and late 2003, but the country as a whole
still lags far behind many other nations, including South Korea, Taiwan and
Canada. The report also points to a widening gap between the digital haves
and have-nots. Only 25% of rural households have a broadband connection,
compared with 40% for urban areas, and only one-in-seven blacks and fewer
than one-in-eight Hispanics lives in a household with high-speed Internet
service. "It shows we continue to have a significant divide between urban
and rural America in the infrastructure of the 21st century," says Gregory
L. Rohde, a top telecom advisor during the Clinton administration.
Significant numbers of rural Americans complained there were no broadband
services available where they live. "This is lousy," says Harris Miller,
head of the Information Technology Association of America. "We're just not
keeping up with our competitors. We're not even keeping up with countries
we don't consider competitors. It's not acceptable." (AP 23 Nov 2004)
<http://apnews.excite.com/article/20041123/D86HL5SG0.html>

[Here's the original AOL story from 12 days ago.]

AOL WINDS DOWN BROADBAND SERVICE
Earlier this year America Online stopped signing up new
broadband customers -- and now it's telling existing broadband
subscribers in nine Southern states that they'll need to find a new
broadband carrier by mid-January, or face being moved to dial-up
service. Broadband customers affected by this decision are residents
of Florida, Kentucky, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi,
Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina.

TELCOS THREATENED BY MUNICIPAL WIFI

[Telcos fight back with army of well-paid lobbyists]

Dozens of municipalities around the country are installing WiFi
networks in order to provide citizens with low- or no-cost wireless
Internet access -- a phenomenon that has raised the ire of large telephone
and cable companies, who see their lucrative broadband businesses eroding.
In response, telcos and cable companies are pushing states to pass
legislation that could make such municipal networks illegal. Last week,
after intensive lobbying by Verizon, the Pennsylvania General Assembly
passed a bill with a deeply buried provision that would make it illegal for
any "political subdivision" to provide to the public "for any compensation
any telecommunications services, including advanced and broadband services
within the service territory of a local exchange telecommunications company
operating under a network-modernization plan." Verizon is the local
exchange operator for most of Pennsylvania and is planning a major
fiber-optic cable rollout. Similar bills have passed in Utah, Louisiana and
Florida. Critics say the telco giants' clout is stifling broadband
expansion in the U.S., but the telcos argue it's unfair for them to have to
compete against local governments, which have easy access to capital and
pay no taxes. (Wall Street Journal 23 Nov 2004)

KAZAA OFFERS FREE VOIP CALLS

online calls anywhere in the world. (Reuters/CNet.com 22 Nov 2004)

MAKE INCISION HERE: RFID TAG USED IN SURGERY

[Tired of hearing they cut off the wrong leg?]

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved use of radio
frequency ID (RFID) tags to ensure that physicians perform the right surgery
on the right patient. Manufactured by SurgiChip Inc., the radio tag is
encoded with the patient's name and the site, type, and date of the surgery;
the patient helps stick the adhesive-backed tag near the site of the surgery
and workers in the hospital's operating room scan the tag to compare that
information with the patient's chart. (AP/San Jose Merury News 19 Nov 2004)
<http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/10226986.htm>

[more on RFIDs]

TRACKING SCHOOLCHILDREN WITH COMPUTER TAGS
A number of school districts around the country are implementing
systems that use radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to track
the whereabouts of schoolchildren. In Spring, Texas, the district's
28,000 students will be given ID cards with RFID chips in them. Card
readers on the district's school busses track where and when students
get on and off the busses and send that information to police and
school administrators. In the event that a child is reported missing,
authorities would use the system's data to help locate the child,
whether the student was kidnapped or simply went to another student's
home after school. A school district in Buffalo, New York, uses a
similar system at the doors of the school to track attendance. Despite
teething problems of the systems, not to mention concerns over cards
that are lost or traded by mischievous students, supporters said they
offer unique capacities to track students and reassure worried parents.
Critics of the systems, including the American Civil Liberties Union
and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said they elevate security
concerns to the level of paranoia and represent an invasion of privacy.

THE COMING BATTLE: GOOGLE VERSUS MICROSOFT
Already competing against one other in Web search, free e-mail, and
techniques for searching individual computers, Google and Microsoft are
drifting into a war over control of the user experience now dominated by
Microsoft's Windows operating system. Industry-watchers say that Google
could make people less dependent on storing information on their
Microsoft-powered PCs and more dependent on free Web-based e-mail and search
functions accessible anywhere from any device regardless of operating
system, and analyst David Garrity says the real question is whether computer
buyers may one day simply decide that they no longer even need a Microsoft
operating system. (AP/Los Angeles Times 22 Nov 2004)

BRITISH LIBRARY GOES WIRELESS
Responding to reports showing strong demand for Internet access,
officials at the British Library have announced the implementation of a
wireless network in the library's reading rooms, auditorium,
restaurants, and outdoor area. A study recently showed that 86 percent
of library patrons carry laptops and that 16 percent came to the
library to use it as a business center. Many visitors routinely leave
the library to check their e-mail at a local cafe, and surveys showed
that many people would like to check their e-mail, as well as access
the library catalog, while in the library. The service will cost users
4.50 British pounds per hour or 35 pounds per month. A pilot program
has been available in the library since May, and usage logs indicate
that in that time, the network has seen 1,200 sessions per week, making
it the busiest hot spot in London.   BBC, 18 November 2004

[Anyone with even the slightest knowledge of statistics will realize
that 86% of any population is not likely to be carrying laptops. . .
this very strange looking statistic is due to the fact that this is
not a library in the sense most of use.  It is not open to the public,
other than a few rooms that look more like a museum, which is what it
really is, by most definitions.  One actually has to pass a test to
gain entrance. . .to be a "reader."  Not only do 86% of the "readers"
bring laptops, but they are incredibly "well-heeled" even by London
standards, as I observed myself when visiting there last month.]

COLLEGE BLOCKS HOTMAIL AND YAHOO TO FIGHT SPAM
Frustrated with the problem of spam and unable to afford antispam
software packages, officials at Guam Community College have implemented
a policy that blocks all mail from Hotmail or Yahoo--favorites with
spammers--from being delivered to college e-mail accounts. Exceptions
are made for return addresses that are on the institution's list of
legitimate addresses. Currently, the college only provides e-mail
accounts to faculty and staff, and many students rely on Hotmail or
Yahoo accounts to keep in touch with faculty or to turn in assignments,
prompting many complaints about the policy. The policy has resulted in
significantly less spam, and the college's technical staff are
spending much less time dealing with the spam that does get through.
Still, many members of the faculty do not support the policy, saying
that whatever benefits it provides do not outweigh the problems it
causes. Joe St. Sauver of the University of Oregon Computing Center and
an expert on spam issues said the tactic of blocking Hotmail and Yahoo
has been tried before but that most institutions dropped it because
they were not happy with the results.

*Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media

Sir Mark Thatcher, son of "The Iron Lady," British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, is finally being forced to
answer questions in open court concerning charges that
he was planning a coup to take over Equatorial Guinea,
a country rich in oil.

The Cape High Court ruled today that he must face court
tomorrow [or the next day, depending on sources], and he
may be extradited later from South Africa to face more
direct charges in Equatorial Guinea.  This ruling has
finally come after months of legal wrangling since his
arrest last August in his suburban Cape Town home.

Dozens of mercenaries and planners have been arrested
in Equatorial Guinea and in Zimbabwe, where one of Sir
Mark's friends has already been convicted.

In earlier arrests on March 7, about 70 men were taken
at the Harare airport, mostly South Africans led by
former SAS officer Simon Mann, a graduate of Eton.

Most of these have been charged with violations of
South Africa's foreign military assistance act and
other charges are pending in other countries.

It would appear all involved deny any participation
in the failed coup attempt, including Severo Moto,
who mysteriously appeared in nearby Mali just before
the coup attempt, apparently ready to be the new leader
if the right-wing network of businessmen had been
successful in taking over the country.  Mr. Moto has
been reported to have been involved in several previous
such failed coup attempts, including one in which he
was arrested aboard a boat containing military supplies
for one of the previous events in 1997.  Government
sources in Spain confirm Mr. Moto's involvement in
these events over the years.

Apparently one of Thatcher's friends has already been
convicted in Zimbabwe.


"Clockwork Orange" Medical Plan Finally Outlawed By Chinese

The Chinese announced that they will no longer be supporting
medical testing on hundreds of human beings in which they
remove or disable the portions of the brain receptive to
certain drugs.  This technology was inherited from Russia,
where no such annoucement has been heard.


*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

>From Jim Carrey:

"Prozac is like a low level of despair."

"Everything is just OK."

"You're not getting any answers."

"People need motivation to do anything.
I don't think human beings learn anything without desperation."


*PREDICTION OF THE WEEK

We will find that Russia only signed the Kyoto accords
to make Bush look bad for not signing, and to gain an
earlier membership in the World Trade Organization [WTO].


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Martha Stewart made $10-$20 million this week, even in jail,
due to her ownership of millions of shares of K-Mart, which
jumped in price when the Sears merger was announced.


Camden, NJ, named "US Most Dangerous City."
[Camden is just across from Phildephia, PA]
Newton, MA, Boston suburb, named the safest.
Murder rate is 0 in Newton, highest in Camden.


$1 of each $7 in the U.S. is spent on health care.  14%
Housing for those above the povertey level equals   20%
Housing for those around the poverty level equals   30%
Housing for those below the poverty level equals    40%
Transportation costs for those above poverty lines  20%
Transportation costs for those below poverty lines  40%

Obviously these studies aren't all from the same year
using the same information base or we would run 100%+
without much effort; however, it should be duly noted
that for those under the poverty line, the sum of all
food, housing, and transportation leaves little room.
Clothing, education, etc., add up to very little.


Back to health care, it all started during the Reagan years:

What Americans spend on health care increased 117% between 1980-1988.
