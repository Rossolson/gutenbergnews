.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

.:: During the past week the following eBooks were manually updated and
reposted with the indicated filenames and transferred into the corresponding
new directories:

Note: Several years ago when the first of Churchill's novels were
contributed to Project Gutenberg a note was inserted in the header stating
the author was a "cousin of Sir Winston Churchill."  This note was
dutifully perpetuated in the headers of the next 59 etexts in the PG
Churchill series.  Richard Stauduhar kindly called to our attention this
was erroneous--in the reposting of the entire set this misinformation has
been corrected along with several hundred other errors.

(Note: the following 45 eBooks, #5356-5400, are all by the American
  Novelist and Historian, Winston Churchill)
