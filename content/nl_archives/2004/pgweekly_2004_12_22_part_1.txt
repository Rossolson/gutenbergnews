iPOD eBOOK READER!!!

A new open source project released under the GPL is officially officially up
as of 22 Dec 04. It's called PodReader, an OS X application that takes
electronic documents such as our PG eBooks and "intelligently" parses them
into a series of text blocks that can be read on the iPod.   Having a nice
open source product of this type is likely to result in rapid collaborative
development over the next couple of months and result in a great overall
experience for the end users.

Ports to Linux and Win32, interfacing to our PG FTP server, syncing with the
news, weather, etc. and several other nice features are in the works. You
can check it out, get the latest binary and source, or join the project at
http://homepage.mac.com/ptwobrussell/podreader.html


HOT REQUEST FOR UNIX "GREP" EXPERT
Please email hart@pglaf.org


HOT REQUEST FOR RUSSIAN TRANSLATOR

We are trying to start up a Project Gutenberg Russian Team,
and we need someone to translate simple email messages from
members of Project Gutenberg who want to provide a service
to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in cyrillic,
we need them translated into English, also in a .doc file.
Thanks!!!     Contact Jared Buck  <JBuck814366460@aol.com>

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, eg.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

We are in the process of rewriting some of the general FAQs and
would appreciate help proofreading them over the next few months.

We've added some new FAQs and generally updated information
about Project Gutenberg.  Take a look, and email Michael or
Greg with any suggestions or corrections.  We'll have these
updated from time to time, now that we've passed #10,000.
A new set of these will be in the works when we pass #20,000.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 14 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

We're still keeping up with Moore's Law!

Moore's Law 12 month percentage =  64%

Moore's Law 18 month percentage = 119%

[100% of Moore's Law = doubling every 18 months]
[There may be some need to refine our program for these figures]

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 50 weeks of this year, we have produced 3,861 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3,861 eBooks!!!

          That's 50 WEEKS as Compared to ~31.5 YEARS!!!


FLASHBACK!

Here's a sample of what books we were doing around eBook #3861

Memoirs of the Court of St. Cloud, Complete, by Stewarton                 3899
[Being Secret Letters from a Gentleman at Paris to a Nobleman in London]
Memoirs of the Court of St. Cloud, Volume 7, by Stewarton                 3898
...
Memoirs of the Court of St. Cloud, Volume 1, by Stewarton                 3892


Memoirs Of The Court Of Marie Antoinette, by Madame Campan                3891
Being the Historic Memoirs of Madam Campan, First Lady in Waiting to the Queen
Memoirs of Marie Antoinette, Queen Of France, Volume 7, by Madame Campan  3890
...
Memoirs of Marie Antoinette, Queen Of France, Volume 1, by Madame Campan  3884


Secret Memoirs of Louis XV/XVI, Complete, by Madame du Hausset, et al     3883
Being Secret Memoirs of Madame du Hausset, Lady's Maid to Madame de Pompadour,
and of an Unknown English Girl & The Princess Lamballe
[Author: Madame du Hausset, an "Unknown English Girl" & the Princess Lamballe]
The Memoirs of Louis XV. and XVI., Volume 7, by Hausset et al.            3882
...
The Memoirs of Louis XV. and XVI., Volume 1, by Hausset et al.            3876


The Memoirs of Louis XIV, by Duc de Saint-Simon                           3875
[Title: The Memoirs of Louis XIV, and His Court and The Regency, Complete]
The Memoirs of Louis XIV., Volume 15, by Duc de Saint-Simon               3874
...
The Memoirs of Louis XIV., Volume 1, by Duc de Saint-Simon                3860


With 14,768 eBooks online as of December 22, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.68 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $.93 when we had 10,750 eBooks a year ago

Can you imagine ~14,768 books each costing ~$.25 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~14,768 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 14,768 eBooks in 33 Years and 05.60 Months We Averaged
       441 Per Year   [We do about 3/4 that much per month these days!]
        36.8 Per Month
         1.21 Per Day

At 3861 eBooks Done In The 357 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11 Per Day
      77 Per Week
     341 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

>From NewsScan:

JUDGE SLAMS SPAMMERS WITH $1-BILLION JUDGMENT

[More below in Edupage section]

A federal judge in Iowa has awarded a small ISP more than $1 billion
in damages in what's believed to be the largest judgment ever against
spammers. The case was brought by Robert Kramer, whose company provides
e-mail service to about 5,000 customers, and who filed suit after his
inbound mail servers were jammed with as many as 10 million spam-mails a
day in 2000. Citing federal racketeering laws (RICO) and the Iowa Ongoing
Criminal Conduct Act, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Wolle ordered AMP
Dollar Savings of Mesa, Ariz., to pay $720 million; Cash Link Systems of
Miami, Fla., $360 million; and TEI Marketing Group, also of Florida,
$140,000. "It's definitely a victory for all of us that open up our e-mail
and find lewd and malicious and fraudulent e-mail in our boxes every day,"
said Kramer, who is unlikely to ever collect on the judgments.

CHINATECH ON THE RISE
Journalist Evan Ramstad notes that China's 250 million users (about one-fifth
of the country's total population) far surpass those of any other country
and that China's technological rise is happening faster than it did elsewhere
in Asia: "China passed the U.S. in unit consumption of TV sets two years ago
as household penetration of TVs passed 90%, closing in on the near ubiquity
of TVs in developed countries. If population trends hold, China is unlikely
to be challenged as the world's largest market for TVs until the middle
of the century, when India is expected to become the most populous country.
And when final figures emerge shortly, we're likely to learn that China
passed the U.S. this year as the world's top PC maker, another change
unlikely to be challenged for years to come."

EBAY PROTESTS EXECUTIVE'S ARREST IN INDIA
EBay is outraged by the arrest of Avnish Bajaj, the Indian-born and
Harvard-educated chief of the company's India auction site Baazee.com, in a
case involving the sale of a video clip of a teenage couple engaged in
illicit acts. EBay says the video clip was never shown on the site and that
the seller had merely offered it to buyers with a description of its content,
but the law under which the arrest makes publishing or transmitting obscene
material in any electronic form punishable by up to five years in jail.

BATTLE IN BANGALORE: MICROSOFT WINS
Microsoft has won a battle against open source software supporters in
Bangalore, India, a high-tech hub whose local authorities have selected
Microsoft as their vendor of choice software for networking the state's
utilities and services in an e-governance project for the 55 million people
of Karnataka state. Microsoft sold software at 45 percent of the market
price to the private company executing the Bangalore project, a move the
company's critics derided as merely a trick to tie large populations to
proprietary software. Defending his decision to choose Microsoft, Indian
official Rajiv Chawla points out that Microsoft is "quite popular even in
villages," and adds: "Let open source become so popular, then we will have
no problem using it." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 20 Dec 2004)

AUTOMATED MEDICATION WORSE THAN THE DISEASE?
A report from U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), a nonprofit group that sets
standards for the drug industry, says that as more hospitals have
implemented automated systems for administering drugs the number of errors
associated with them has risen. USP vice president Diane Cousins says, "It
would seem logical that applying computer technology to the medication use
process would have a significant positive impact in preventing medication
errors. Yet, depending on the computer's design or user competence, new
points of potential errors can emerge." Kenneth Kizer of the National
Quality Forum agrees with Cousins: "Technology offers great opportunity to
reduce errors, but it's not a panacea. You can't just throw a computerized
system in and expect that everything's fixed. It has to be done right. The
technology is only as good as the people who use it."

CALIFORNIA DREAMIN' OF GREENER GADGETS
The California Energy Commission Wednesday unanimously approved
standards to be phased in beginning in 2006 that would require household
appliances sold in the state, including televisions, VCRs, DVD players and
cell phone chargers, to run on one to three watts. Even when idle, such
appliances now typically gobble up two to 10 watts. Commissioners estimate
that compliance with the new guidelines will save commercial and
residential power customers more than $3 billion over 15 years.

Arlen Specter (R, PA) will replace Hatch as chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee. Will there be much change? One aide says that Specter "has been a
follower rather than a leader on these issues" and therefore might let Hatch
keep holding the reins. However, David Green of the Motion Picture
Association of America (MPAA) predicts that Specter will rise to the
occasion: "Copyright issues are important and they're going to percolate up,
and it's really impossible for him to ignore them. He might be right now
more interested in something else, but because these issues are important to
America they are going to be important to Arlen Specter." (Washington Post

SEARCHING FOR THE FUTURE OF TV
The startup search engine Blinkx will allow users to search the Web for
selected video clips from 15 television channels, so that, for example, if
you type in "Kofi Annan" Blinkx will offer a selection of digitized clips
cued up to the point where the U.N. secretary general is mentioned. Coming
soon with similar services: Yahoo, Google, and Microft. Blinkx, which has
analyzed and indexed 42,000 hours of video, says "fair use" provisions of
copyright law allow it to show a clip of up to 30 seconds. But attorney
Daniel Harris, an intellectual property attorney, warns: "It definitely
sounds like an area where there could be lawsuits."

GEICO CASE AGAINST GOOGLE DISMISSED BY JUDGE
A federal district court judge in Virginia has dismissed a key claim in
the trademark infringement suit brought against Google by Geico, the auto
insurance company. Geico had argued that the Google practice that allows
Geico's competitors to buy ads linked to searches for "Geico" and "Geico
Direct" confuses Web surfers who are looking specifically for Geico, but the
judge ruled that there was not enough evidence the Google practice actually
confuses consumers. One intellectual property attorney not involved in the
case predicts: "It will not be binding precedent. That's how cases get to
the Supreme Court."(New York Times 15 Dec 2004)

ANOTHER ROUND IN THE APPLE-VS.-REAL NETWORKS FIGHT
Apple has begun blocking the technology that RealNetworks created to
evade the copy-protection shield used by Apple's iPod. When RealNetworks
introduced its Harmony technology this summer, it hoped to dissolve some of
the barriers created by incompatible, proprietary digital music standards,
and said it had reverse-engineered Apple's copy-protection code to allow
songs purchased from non-Apple online outlets to be playable on the iPod. To
deal with Apple's new move, RealNetworks now says it "will look at the Apple
upgrade and see how it'll make Harmony work once again with the iPod."

CONROVERSY OVER WIRELESS PHONE DIRECTORY
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal wants the cellular
phone industry to discard its plans to create a directory assistance system
for wireless phone numbers because there are "too many unknowns and dangers
and too few protections at this point." But Kathleen Pierz, a Michigan
analyst specializing in directory assistance counseling, says there are
plenty of safeguards: "This is so buttoned up from a customer point of view,
people don't have to worry. Blumenthal fears that a list of wireless numbers
would inevitably be sold to telemarketers: "If the lists are there, they
will be sold. They are so valuable. No cell phone company will resist the
temptation to sell those lists for the huge profits." Pierz, however, points
out that there is no marketing value to such lists because of existing
federal laws preventing entities from calling a cell phone.

ACACIA EXPANDS PATENT HOLDINGS

[The Speculators Take Over From The Inventors, Yet Again!]

Acacia Research, which has made a name for itself pursuing patent
infringement lawsuits, has acquired Global Patent Holdings, an umbrella
company whose holdings represent numerous high-tech patents. One of
Global Patent's companies, TechSearch, has already entered into
licensing deals with companies including Sony and Samsung. Previously,
Acacia has threatened or taken legal action against a range of
companies, alleging patent infringement for technologies that stream
media over the Web. Targets of that legislation have included
pornography Web sites, the Walt Disney Company, and colleges and
universities that use streaming media in online education. Acacia said
the new acquisition will expand its patent holdings to cover dozens of
technologies, or parts of them, including those related to P2P
communication and spreadsheet software. Paul Ryan, CEO of Acacia, said,
"We will continue to acquire additional portfolios, as Acacia moves
towards its goal of becoming the leading technology licensing company."
Analysts said Acacia's business model of acquiring patents and
earning revenues through licenses represents a growing trend in
the technology industry.

RICE RESEARCHERS DISCOVER GOOGLE SEARCH FLAW

[Google privacy issues, and new upgrades without telling the users]

Researchers at Rice University in November uncovered a security flaw in
Google's recently released desktop search tool. Google Desktop is a
downloadable program that creates an index of material on a user's
computer, including e-mail and individual documents. When that user
does a Google search of the Web, the application incorporates local
resources from the index in the results. In what began as a student
project to investigate how Google Desktop works, two students and a
computer science professor found that the application could be fooled
into sending results from a local index to Web sites, allowing a hacker
to see them. The problem would only reveal small portions of
information, and no attacks using the flaw have been reported. After
being notified by the researchers of the vulnerability in late
November, Google patched the flaw and began offering a new version of
the search tool in December. In addition, the application includes a
feature that allows Google to update the software without user input or
even knowledge about the upgrade.

ARMY CONTRACTS FOR ELECTRONIC SYSTEM TO ELIMINATE PAPER
The U.S. Army has contracted with IBM and several smaller companies to
develop an entirely electronic records-management system to be
implemented over the next 10 years. Army personnel fill out
approximately 15 million forms each year, using as many as 100,000
different forms, for tasks including ordering supplies, keeping medical
records, and managing awards and citations. Under the current system,
forms must be printed out, hand-signed, and moved manually through all
applicable authorizations. The new system, part of the Army's Forms
Content Management Program, will eliminate much of that paperwork and
save large amounts of money. According to Jim Acklin, the director of
the project, the Army will save $1.3 billion a year in "cost
avoidance." In addition to IBM, the project includes services from
PureEdge and Silanis, two Canadian companies.

GOOGLE PARTNERS WITH LIBRARIES TO DIGITIZE CONTENT
Google has announced agreements with major libraries to digitize books
in their collections and make them available online. Google is funding
the project, which is said to have strong support from founders Larry
Page and Sergey Brin, who said that such dissemination of information
has always been one of their goals. Under the arrangements, Google
reportedly will scan all of the eight million books at Stanford
University's library and all of the University of Michigan's seven
million texts. For the others involved in the project--Harvard
University, Oxford University, and the New York Public Library--only
portions of the collections will be scanned. For books whose copyright
remains in effect, Google will scan the entire text but make available
only selected portions online. Books whose copyright has run out will
be available in their entirety. The announcement follows similar
programs from the Library of Congress as well as Amazon to digitize
content of books.

JUDGE HITS SPAMMERS WITH $1 BILLION FINE
A federal judge in Iowa has issued fines totaling $1 billion against
three spammers, marking what some observers believe is the largest
judgment handed down to spammers. The ruling came from a case filed by
Robert Kramer, operator of a small Internet service provider in eastern
Iowa. Kramer, whose company serves about 5,000 customers, filed suit
against 300 spammers, alleging that they send his subscribers upwards
of 10 million spam e-mails per day. The judge ordered three of the
defendants to pay damages under a state law that allows for fines of
$10 per spam message, and those amounts were then tripled under the
federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Cases
against other defendants are still pending. In his ruling Judge Charles
R. Wolle ordered Arizona-based AMP Dollar Savings to pay $720 million,
Florida-based Cash Link Systems to pay $360 million, and TEI Marketing
Group, also based in Florida, to pay $140,000. No attorneys for any of
the defendants were present during the trial, and the plaintiff's attorney
conceded it is unlikely his client will ever collect any of the damages.

TECHNOLOGY REVIEW



*Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media



*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK




*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

TIMSS = Third International Mathematics and Science Study

Two weeks ago nearly every new service had positive comments
about the improved U.S. students' TIMSS test scores that come
out every four years.  Only one source I heard had the nerve
to say that the scores didn't really show any improvement,
while the rest seemed to reek of jingoism.

However, in reviewing the scores, it seems obvious that the
U.S. test scores in question, the 8th grade math scores,
were basically unchanged, moving up less than 1% from the
1999 score of 500 to the 2003 score of 504, out of 800.

This represents a change of 1/5 of 1% per year, which I
seriously doubt is within the statistical parameters of
the TIMSS testing methodologies.

Much more likely is the fact that the U.S. ranking has
been changed more by changes in the other countries,
both in terms of the changes the countries chosen for
the 2003 tests, and the performance changes of those
countries that stayed the same.

For example, some score changes in the top 10 of 1999:

Country            1999/2003  Change

Singapore           643/605  =  38
Korea               607/589  =  18
Japan               605/570  =  35
Hong Kong           588/586  =   3
Belgium (Fl)        565/537  =  28
Slovak Republic     547/508  =  39
Netherlands         541/536  =   5
Slovenia            541/493  =  48

Average       579.63/553.00  =  26.75

Thus we see that that most other countries changed
much more than did the U.S., which changed very little.
It would appear that the U.S. didn't really move on the
charts so much as other countries moved up and down past
the U.S.

In addition, it appears that the science scores were not
mentioned in these news reports, nor were the scores for
students in the lower grade classes.  I will have to dig
them up to let you know more about them in later issues.
