.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.



The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at



  http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml



which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also

an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria

(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional

criteria).



And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language at the above

link.



Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the

world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on

the search results page.



To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest to you,

visit:



  http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml



EBooks numbered 1 to 10000 are located in "release year" directories. Over

time, the "release year" advanced, so that by November 2003 the release year

was 2006.  Starting with eBook #10001, they are filed by their official eBook

number, with a unique subdirectory based on that eBook number.



FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000



To get to a directory listing you can use either:



  http://gutenberg.net/1/

    - or -

  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/



. . .navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the

appropriate level, and then select the file you wish to download,

using your usual download procedures.  This system works on mirrors,

too, and will hold all eBooks starting with the number "1" for

10,000 and beyond.





FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000:



Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download site (or

a mirror) if you know the filename and year you want.  For example:



  http://gutenberg.net/etext06/

    - or -

  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/



and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated

eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)



                              ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~



     Note:  this listing best viewed with a fixed-width font, such as

            Courier New or similar.
