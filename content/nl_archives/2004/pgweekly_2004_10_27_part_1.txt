There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, eg.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.



MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 14 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 42 weeks of this year, we have produced 3318 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3318 eBooks!!!

          That's 42 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With 14,225 eBooks online as of October 27, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.70 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $.99 when we had 10,069 eBooks a year ago

Can you imagine ~14,225 books each costing ~$.29 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~14,225 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 14,225 eBooks in 33 Years and 03.75 Months We Averaged
       427 Per Year   [We do about 3/4 that much per month these days!]
        35.5 Per Month
         1.16 Per Day

At 3318 eBooks Done In The 300 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11.0 Per Day
      78.5 Per Week
     338.4 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.


                            *Flashback!!!

                   3318 New eBooks So Far in 2004

               It took us ~31 years for the first 3318 !

       That's the 9.75 months of 2004 as Compared to ~31 years!!!

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


>From NewsScan:

DESCENT FROM PRIVACY: A 'SLIPPERY SLOPE'
Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, warns: "Most
consumers don't fully understand the tradeoffs they're making with privacy."
As an example, she argues that the potential widespread use of the VeriChip
-- a tiny radio transmitter inserted under a person's skin -- is "a
nightmare situation" for privacy, because at first workers might be induced
to wear the devices simply to get high-security jobs but that eventually the
transmitters would be much more broadly required: "All of a sudden it
becomes mandatory for certain classes of people. I just see this as an
extremely slippery slope."(Christian Science Monitor 21 Oct 2004)

U.S. PASSPORTS GET CHIPPED

[If crooks read your passport, they will know when you are not at home.]

Beginning in January, diplomats and U.S. State Department employees
will be issued passports containing embedded RFID chips that will contain
the individual's name, address, date and place of birth, and a digital
photo. Ordinary citizens applying for new passports will get the high-tech
version starting in the spring. Civil liberties advocates have called the
new passports a "privacy horror," and point out that even if the data were
encrypted (and it's not), it would still be very easy to steal. "If 180
countries have access to the technology for reading this thing, whether or
not it is encrypted, from a security standpoint, that is a very leaky
system," says Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Lee Tien. "Strictly
from a technology standpoint, any reader system, even with security, that
was so widely deployed and accessible to so many people worldwide will be
subject to some very interesting compromises." Meanwhile, a travel privacy
expert says that in addition to identity thieves, commercial travel
companies, including hotels, will capture the data when people check in or
exchange currency. Intel RFID expert Roy Want says those fears are overblown,
but acknowledges some theft is possible: "In principle someone could rig up
a reader, perhaps in a doorway you are forcing people to go through.
You could read some of these tags some of the time." (Wired.com 21 Oct 2004)

ROBOT USE TO SURGE BY 2007
The use of robots to perform household tasks such as lawn-mowing,
vacuuming, guard duty and other chores is slated to increase sevenfold by
2007, according to the U.N.'s latest World Robotics Survey. The report says
607,000 automated domestic helpers are in use now, two thirds of them
purchased last year. Most of them -- 570,000 -- are robot vacuum cleaners,
and 37,000 of them are robotic lawn-mowers. While the report predicts that
vacuum cleaners will continue to hold the lead, sales of window-washing and
pool-cleaning robots are expected to take off. Meanwhile, sales of robotic
companions, like Sony's Aibo dog, are also expanding, with some 692,000
"entertainment robots" around the world. Japan remains home to about half
of the current 800,000 industrial robots, which are used primarily on
automobile assembly lines, but Europe and North America are catching up.
And "service robots" are branching out, performing such tasks as milking
cows, handling toxic waste, transporting medicine around hospitals and
assisting surgeons. By the end of this decade, robots will "also assist old
and handicapped people with sophisticated interactive equipment, carry out
surgery, inspect pipes and sites that are hazardous to people, fight fire
and bombs," says the report. (AP 21 Oct 2004)

MUSIC INDUSTRY ON THE WRONG COURSE
Wharton business professor Joel Waldfogel says the music industry is
mistakenly pursuing a short-term strategy in backing the Inducing
Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004, which would hold liable any entity
that "intentionally aids, abets, induces or procures" copyrighted material.
Rather than fighting technological advances through litigation, the music
industry must come up with new business models -- for instance, taking
advantage of the Internet to slash its distribution costs. "Instead of
putting out CDs and shipping them on trucks, they can send them directly at
a very low cost. That does suggest a very different business model than
charging $15 or $20 for a CD. It might be a much more attractive way to do
things. Stuff that is easy to distribute wants to be free. Given that
force, I think [the recording industry] needs to come up with a new model
for generating income," says Waldfogel. (Knowledge@Wharton Oct 20-Nov 2 2004)

ADVERTISERS TRACK RADIO LISTENING HABITS
In 14 locations around the Washington area, a company called
MobilTrak has installed sensing devices on utility poles that pick up the
electronic signals from cars' antennas as they speed by and record which
station they're listening to. The monitoring process gives businesses a
welcome insight into the listening habits of their target audience and
helps them decide how to allocate their advertising budget, says MobilTrak
managing partner C. David Boice: "It's all about precision marketing. It's
about giving marketers real-time data about what's happening in certain
areas at certain times so they don't waste their advertising dollars." The
most enthusiastic adopters have been car dealerships, who generally believe
that 80% of their business comes from people who live or work within 10
miles of their location. One dealer found that the two stations he'd been
investing in -- a talk-personality station and a contemporary music station
-- didn't even rank in the top 10 for in-car radio listeners driving by his
dealership. "It was a real eye-opener," he says. Currently, MobilTrak picks
up only FM signals, but the company says it plans to introduce technology
that picks up AM and satellite station signals next spring.

CYBERSECURITY LARGELY IGNORED BY INDIVIDUAL USERS
A new study by America Online and the National Cyber Security
Alliance indicates that about 80% of home PCs are infected with spyware,
but most users aren't even aware of it. And while 85% of users had
installed antivirus software, two-thirds of those had not updated it in
the past week. In addition, about 20% had an active virus on their machines
and two-thirds did not have a firewall installed. AOL chief trust officer
Tatiana Gau says the results highlight just how vulnerable the average
online user is to malicious hackers. "No consumer would walk down
the street waving a stack of cash or leave their wallet sitting in a
public place, but far too many are doing the exact same thing online.
Without basic protections like antivirus, spyware and firewall software,
consumers are leaving their personal and financial information at risk."

SPYWARE RAMPANT, USERS UNAWARE
Results of a recent study highlight the lack of awareness among a wide
majority of home computer users about malicious code and the tools they
could use to protect their computers against it. The study was carried
out by America Online and the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA),
which is promoting October as National Cyber Security Awareness Month.
Technicians from AOL and NCSA went to the homes of more than 300
computer users and inspected their systems. Among the study's more
alarming findings were that 80 percent of home computers are currently
infected with spyware and that 90 percent of users with infected
machines were completely unaware of the infection. Authors of the
report's findings also noted that close to 60 percent of home users do
not know the difference between a firewall and antivirus software and
that two-thirds of users do not have a firewall installed. Although 85
percent of users had antivirus software installed on their computers,
only one-third had updated it within the previous week. Of the
computers studied, 20 percent had active viruses.

JUDGE ISSUES RESTRAINING ORDER ON SPYWARE
A federal judge has issued a restraining order against notorious
spammer Stanford Wallace, forcing him to disable spyware programs that
secretly track users' actions and flood their computers with pop-up
ads. Wallace, who in the 1990s headed one of the most prolific spamming
companies, is the target of the first action taken by the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) against spyware purveyors. The FTC also alleges that
Wallace sold consumers bogus tools that supposedly detect and remove
spyware. Wallace's attorney said his client wants to use the Internet
in "lawful and proper ways" and "looks forward to an opportunity to
establish exactly what advertising practices are allowable." Laura
Sullivan, attorney for the FTC, described the judge's order as "relief
for consumers" while the case is being resolved. A hearing in the case
has been scheduled for November 9.

IBM TO ISSUE SECURITY ALERTS
IBM will begin releasing monthly security reports called the Global
Business Security Index to give corporate customers a snapshot of
current threats to computer networks. The reports will be based on data
collected from 2,700 IBM employees and about 500,000 sensors in 34
countries. The sensors are applications that monitor attacks and
attempted attacks against networks. The new reports will be part of
IBM's Security Threats and Attack Trends service, which is available
for about $10,000 a month and resembles the DeepSight Threat Management
System offered by Symantec. Analysts said such tools are valuable for
network administrators to anticipate threats and minimize the damage
they cause. Observers noted, however, that the computer security
industry is locked in a cycle of announcing vulnerabilities and then
working frantically to patch them before hackers exploit them.

*Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media


DISNEY AND VIACOM:  HUGE FINES FOR TOO MUCH ADVERTIZING

Only the more independent media are reporting that Disney,
the world's second largest media company, has been fined a
whopping half million dollars for placing more advertizing
than is legal in their programming.  In addition, Viacom--
the multimedia empire--has been fined a million dollars to
also penalize them for this illegal behavior.

Even in these days of rampant deregulation, there is still
a law against saturating programs with advertizing and the
"product placement" of advertizing items within programs--
and both Disney and Viacom were nabbed by the FCC--Federal
Communications Commission for these violations, but you do
not hear much about this on the major media who are in bed
with these two media giants through various deals.  A news
report literally half way around the world reported this.

The laws prohibit advertizing in excess of 20% of showtime
[slightly different on weekdays than weekends], but it was
broken some 600 times last year in this case, and some 145
product placement violations were cited in this period, in
which products related to the programs were illegally sold
in the programs' advertizing slots.

The vast majority [85 million] of U.S. households received
these programs last year, in which various programs of ABC
and Disney were cited for these violations.

[Note, most or all of these laws are designed to protect a
viewer of age 12 or under from more than 20% saturation of
advertizing per hour of television.  Apparently adults are
expected to fend for themselves, as they get saturated for
approximately 1/3 of each hour with advertizing.  If there
is anything you can forward on this, please do.]

[In related stories from various stock exchanges, it would
appear Disney is not doing well, with European stock price
falling dramatically, and the selling off of the 333 store
Disney chain of retail outlets.  Disney investors are also
suing Disney a couple million dollars for paying off their
former Disney President, Michael Ovitz, to the tune of $77
million dollars, apparently including such personages as a
former U.S. Senate member, and a famous Oscar winner, in a
legal process that could apparently be taught in textbooks
for the next few centuries.  The details are still sketchy
but apparently there was a total of $140 million involved,
as severance pay for Mr. Ovitz, perhaps only half of which
is involved in this case.  Ovitz barely lasted one year as
Disney President, and due to the manner in which he left a
severance package is being challenged as inappropriate.  A
quick look indicates he was hired 9 years ago, so why have
the lawsuits only come up now?  In another point, it would
appear that the Disney corporation would get to keep funds
and interest returned under this lawsuit, not investors.]

Law pundits predict that this case will drive up the price
of executive salaries paid up front, as this case seems to
have poked a serious hold in the Golden Parachute idea.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


THE HUMAN GENOME IS SHRINKING

Recent estimates over the years of how many genes it takes
to actually build a human being are shrinking.  Remember a
while back when they talked about millions of genes. . . .

Now they think it really only takes just over 20,000. . .!

It turns out most of the human genome doesn't do very much.


INDEX FINGERS POINT THE WAY FOR MALE SCIENTISTS
from The Scotsman

Male scientists are good at research because they have higher-than-average
levels of the female hormone oestrogen which aids analytical skills, a
study on Bath University academics today revealed.

The survey found that male scientists tended to have longer index fingers
than other men, indicating high levels of oestrogen present in their
bodies.

Men studied had levels of oestrogen as high as their testosterone levels,
which caused the right side of their brains responsible for spatial and
analytical skills, to develop more strongly.
