again. I'll save you all the long story, but this week will be my last
newsletter in charge, you can read more of my comments futher down,
but my suggestion would be to grab hold of your mobile phone first,
you'll need it to read your next etext. What am I talking about? See below.

Happy reading,

Alice

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

      If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
      the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
      following:

      1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
              http://gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
      which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
      http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

      2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
      working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
      years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
      for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
      progress" list:
              http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

      3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
      date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
      submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
      blank) to:
              http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

      You'll hear back within a few days.



2) News and Comment

PG WAP site - read an etext via your phone

        I'm pleased to announce/brag that there is now a PG WAP site available
for wireless devices such as mobile phones. It allows users to search
the library by author and title, and download eBooks with a reader
program in mobile Java (check your phone's blurb: does it support
"downloadable games?"). To get to it, just point your device at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/

        I've tested it in as many ways as I can think of, but I would really
like some help here. Even if you don't have Java support, I'd very much
appreciate your feedback on the usability of the WAP site. In addition,
please do give me a yell if you notice anything awry with the main
website, which I've modified to divert WAP users to the new site.

Many thanks,
Meredydd Luff

Now I have an excuse to buy one! Alice

Just a reminder that, our very own Brett Fishburne has created a
Project Gutenberg group on the SETIhome website
(http://setiathome.berkeley.edu). Anyone interested in using their
screensaver to search for aliens can go to the website, join the
effort and then JOIN THE GROUP! Brett informs me that there is now a
version of SETI for the MAC, so you have no excuse.

3) Notes and Queries, Reviews and Features









A few thoughts...

Just before I pick up the coffee stained magazines and put them in my
box, put my chair under the desk and head for the nearest pub, I would
like to take this opportunity to put down a few thoughts.

Since discovering PG in 2002 I have made many friends and been
introduced to so many new ideas. I have never ceased to be amazed at
the 'can do' attitude of the people around me, the way that problems
become solutions, that people will drop everything to help in a crisis
and that people will send you get well messages from across the
continent and cards at New Year from the US, even though they have
never met you. Perhaps, I should also add the ability to forgive my
many spelling mistakes.

Project Gutenberg is going through many changes at this time, some of
which are well overdue. This will be a process that can be messy and
may lose people who feel that they and their ideas are not catered
for. Project Gutenberg should not lose sight of what it actually is -
all things to all people. This is one of the few places where you
really can contribute what you want when you want and in the way you
want. It cannot afford to lose that if it is to grow and become more
diverse. It does require people with ideas, inspiration and the
ability to look at the world in a slightly different way. I hope that
Project Gutenberg can accomodate these ways of thinking as it
adjusts to ever increasing numbers of volunteers. To develop and
mature requires the need to not be afraid of change.

Before I go a last word for two people who prefer to try and stay
behind the scenes where they can and without whom life at the
newsletter would have been impossible, so thanks to Brett and George,
may your beer glasses never run dry!

Best wishes to you all,

Alice
