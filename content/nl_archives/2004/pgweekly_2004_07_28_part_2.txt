.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

Joe Loewenstein provides additional information about the following:

#13017, Five Nights, by Victoria Cross:  Annie Sophy Cory (1868-1952) was
born in India but lived most of her adult life in Europe. She wrote under
various pen names including Victoria Cross, Vivian Cory, and V. C. Griffin.
Her novels dealt with subjects in advance of their time.

#13015, Tales of Old Japan, by Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford:  The
author, Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford (1837-1916), Lord Redesdale, was
in the British Foreign Service as a young man. He was assigned to the
legation in Japan for several years and acquired a life-long fascination
with Japanese culture. This book has been a standard source of
information about Japanese folklore and customs since its original
publication in 1871 and has been in print ever since. This file is taken
from the 1910 Shilling Edition.

#13022, My Book of Indoor Games, by Clarence Squareman:  A book of games
for children with lovely illustrations. Most of us know by another name
the game called in this book "Lubin Loo."

#13044, The Idler in France, by Marguerite Gardiner:  The author was born
Margaret Power (1789-1849), the daughter of a poor Irish squire. At age
14 her father forced her to marry an abusive army officer; the marriage
lasted only a few months. After living several years as the mistress of
an Englishman, she married the wealthy Earl of Blessington. After the
earl died, she supported herself and her lover by writing. Her story
brings to mind Lady Carbury in Trollope's "The Way We Live Now."
