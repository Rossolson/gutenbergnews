HEADLINE NEWS!!!

AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT CHOOSES TO CHANGE COPYRIGHT RULES

[Depite a resolution passed to the contrary three years ago. . . .
This is what is known as "economic warfare," and, as in warfare
in general, it is the public who loses the most.]

The final element of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
has passed through the Australian federal parliament.

Copyright changes in last-minute talks are designed to:

1.
Enable people other than copyright owners to force ISPs
to remove materials allegedly infringing copyright.

2.
Take effect on January 1, 2005.

3.
Extended Australian copyright 20 years to now
reach 70 years past the lifespan of the author.

***

On the other hand, Project Gutenberg is getting great PR from:

THE DA VINCI CODE

"For their generous assistance in the research of the book, I would
like to acknowledge the Louvre Museum, the French Ministry of Culture,
Project Gutenberg, Bibliothe`que Nationale, the Gnostic Society Library,
the Department of Paintings Study and Documentation Service at the Louvre,
Catholic World News, Royal Observatory Greenwich, London Record Society,
the Muniment Collection at Westminster Abbey, John Pike and the Federation
of American Scientists, and the five members of Opus Dei (three active,
two former) who recounted their stories, both positive and negative,
regarding their experiences inside Opus Dei."

***

eMusic

In our efforts to further the digitization of sheet music, Project
Gutenberg also recommends the Mutopia Project.  The following was
contributed by the project team leader, Chris Sawer:

"The Mutopia project consists of a growing online collection of sheet
music, all of which may be freely downloaded, printed, copied,
distributed, modified, performed and recorded. It has just celebrated
its fifth year online, and now has nearly 500 works, ranging from
simple pieces for solo instruments, to large orchestral pieces and even
an entire opera. Composers from Bach to Vivaldi are featured, along
with some early jazz, and some modern pieces which have been released
under a free license by their composers. Visit our website to see what
we've got - and maybe contribute some music yourself!"

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 49 weeks of this year, we have produced 3,800 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3,800 eBooks!!!

          That's 49 WEEKS as Compared to ~31.5 YEARS!!!


FLASHBACK!

Here's a sample of what books we were doing around eBook #3800

Feb 2003 The Ethics, by Benedict de Spinoza   [Spinoza #11][ethicxxx.xxx] 3800
[Full Latin Title:  Ethica Ordine Geometrico Demonstrata] [Trans:  Elwes]
Feb 2003 Landholding In England, by Joseph Fisher[Fisher#2][lndiexxx.xxx] 3799
Feb 2003 Reminiscences of Captain Gronow, by Captain Gronow[grnowxxx.xxx] 3798

Feb 2003 Under the Lilacs, by Louisa May Alcott [Alcott #9 [ullcsxxx.xxx] 3795
Feb 2003 L. Annaeus Seneca On Benefits, by Aubrey Stewart  [bnftsxxx.xxx] 3794
Feb 2003 Joseph II. and His Court, by L. Muhlbach   [LM #8][j2ahcxxx.xxx] 3793
Feb 2003 Capitola The Madcap, by Emma D. E. N. Southworth  [mdcapxxx.xxx] 3792

Feb 2003 Recollections of Geoffrey Hamlyn by Henry Kingsley[hmlynxxx.xxx] 3786


With 14,707 eBooks online as of December 15, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.68 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $.94 when we had 10,069 eBooks a year ago

Can you imagine ~14,707 books each costing ~$.26 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~14,707 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 14,707 eBooks in 33 Years and 05.40 Months We Averaged
       440 Per Year   [We do about 3/4 that much per month these days!]
        36.6 Per Month
         1.20 Per Day

At 3800 eBooks Done In The 343 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11 Per Day
      78 Per Week
     340 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

*Headline News from NewsScan and Edupage

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


>From NewsScan:

GOOGLE CUTS DEAL WITH LIBRARIES TO DIGITIZE HOLDINGS
Flush with new wealth after its IPO last summer, Google has offered
to underwrite the cost of digitizing library collections at Harvard,
Stanford, Oxford, the University of Michigan and the New York Public
Library. Although company executives declined to comment on the total
funding amount, one estimate pegs it at $10 for each of the more than 15
million books and other documents covered in the agreement. The
announcement comes as a number of other library digitization projects are
underway, including one at the Library of Congress to put selections of its
best holdings online and one at the University of California to create the
California Digital Library. In addition, the Library of Congress and a
group of international libraries from the U.S., Canada, Egypt, China and
the Netherlands say they're planning to create a publicly available digital
archive of one million books on the Internet. The trend toward online
libraries and virtual card catalogs has publishers scrambling to respond
and libraries rethinking their central mission as storehouses of printed,
indexed material. "Our world is about to change in a big, big way," says
Daniel Greenstein, university librarian for the California Digital Library.
Instead of devoting time and effort to maintaining physical collections,
libraries in the future can focus on gathering information and making it
accessible online. (New York Times 14 Dec 2004)
<http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/14/technology/14google.html>

CONCERNS ABOUT GOOGLE'S ONLINE READING ROOM
Google's new plan to digitize the collections of leading research
libraries to establish a massive online reading room causes some librarians
to fear the commercialization of their institutions. Duane Webster,
executive director of the Association of Research Libraries, explains,
"There is anxiety about whether the student researcher, scholar or citizen
will be guided into the free public access rather than being lured into a
purchasing relationship with the publisher." Webster suggests that to allay
those fears, free, open access must remain an option. However, he also makes
clear that the greater good of expanding the public's access to resources
outweighs the eventual possibility that ads would be attached to library
materials. Brewster Kahle, founder and president of the Internet Archive,
comments: "The public domain belongs to the public and should be publicly
accessible without running only into commercial interests. There's room for
both, and I hope that we do not evolve into an either-or situation." (AP/San
Jose Mercury News 15 Dec 2004)

MOBILE PHONES TO OUTNUMBER LAND LINES
Cell phones are expected to generate more revenue this year than
traditional land line phones in Africa, Asia and Latin America, according
to a new report by the International Telecommunication Union. Just four
years ago, fixed-line phone revenue was nearly double that of wireless, but
mobile phone use is growing rapidly, especially in developing countries
where wireless networks are much cheaper to install than traditional
terrestrial ones. "Virtually all the global growth in the telecoms service
sector over the last decade has come from the mobile sector, broadband and
other data services," says Susan Schorr, one of the authors of the study.
"Taken together, the value of mobile and other non-voice services is now
greater than that of the traditional fixed-line telephone service, which
had been the mainstay of public telecommunication operators since the late
19th century." Since 2000, four-fifths of all growth in mobile phone sales
took place in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet Union. "The
developing world is where most of the potential for future growth
resides," says Schorr, who adds that broadband is catching on in those
countries as well, with China expected to overtake the U.S. this year as
the world's biggest broadband market. (AP 10 Dec 2004)

U.S. AND TIME WARNER: LET'S SETTLE UP

[AOL Finally Bites The Bullet]

Time Warner has agreed to settle with the government in two separate
cases:  the Justice Department's investigation of whether AOL's advertising
deals with smaller Internet companies were used to exaggerate AOL growth,
and the SEC's investigation into accounting irregularities at the company.
Time Warner is expected to pay $500-600 million to settle all civil and
criminal accusations with the two agencies. (New York Times 15 Dec 2004)

DISSIN' CHINA

[Not all news coming out of China is positive]

Law enforcement authorities in China have banned the new British
computer game "Football Manager 2005" because it refers to Taiwan as a
separate country, contrary to the mainland government's insistence that
Taiwan belongs to China. The government is searching for the game online and
in computer software markets, cybercafes, and places that sell pirated
software. A spokesman for the game's developer, Sports Interactive, says
it's working on a Chinese version for release in China that will comply with
local requirements: "We will follow the correct submission and approval
process within China and look forward to feedback from the Chinese
authorities on any modifications that may be required." Last week China also
banned a Nike television commercial it says is disrespectful and blasphemous
toward Chinese culture. The ad features NBA star LeBron James in a mock
video with a kung fu master, two women in traditional Chinese attire, and a
pair of dragons. (AP/9 Nov 2004)

IT'S OFFICIAL: IBM STRIKES DEAL TO SELL PC DIVISION

[IBM goes back to being monolithic, leaves PC world for Big Business]

[N.B. the price is 1/8 as much as Oracle paid for PeopleSoft!]

IBM is selling its PC business to Chinese computer giant Lenovo Group
for $1.25 billion in cash and stock. As part of the deal, IBM will own an
18.9% stake in Lenovo, which will be allowed to use the IBM brand for five
years, as well as other trademarks on PCs and notebook computers. The sale
vaults Lenovo to a solid No. 3 slot in the global PC market, behind Dell
and Hewlett-Packard. In a message to IBM workers, chairman Sam Palmisano
(who once headed the PC business) said the move was part of the company's
strategy to focus on making products for large government and industry
customers. "The PC business is rapidly taking on characteristics of the
home and consumer electronic industry, which favors economies of scale,
pricing power and a focus on individual users and buyers," wrote Palmisano.

MICROSOFT UNVEILS DESKTOP SEARCH TOOL
Hot on the heels of Google's Desktop Search launch two months ago,
Microsoft has rolled out its competing MSN Toolbar Suite that enables users
to search for keywords in a variety of types of files, from e-mails to
instant messages to PDFs. Google's Desktop Search does not support searches
in PDF files but, unlike MSN Toolbar, it does record all Web pages visited.
Both products are still in beta stage, but meanwhile the competition is
heating up with Yahoo's announcement last week that it will launch a
desktop search product in January, and AOL's plans to join the fray
sometime early next year. (AP 13 Dec 2004)

PENN STATE URGES MOVING FROM IE
Officials in the Information Technology Services department at
Pennsylvania State University have sent a notice to students suggesting
that they switch to a browser other than Internet Explorer (IE) to
increase the security of their computers. Recent reports in the media
about IE vulnerabilities, as well as warnings from the Computer
Emergency and Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, prompted
Penn State's recommendation that students look at browsers including
Firefox, Safari, and Opera. A spokesperson for the university said,
"We're not telling people to wipe off IE, because you need IE to do
operating-system updates." As part of a two-month campaign to increase
computer security across campus, however, the university is urging
students to examine other browsers and to consider the benefits they
might provide for increased protection from malicious code. Also
included in the security campaign are reminders for students to install
firewalls and antivirus software, to keep those applications updated,
and to install operating-system updates regularly.

IPOD REQUIREMENT IN SECONDARY SCHOOL
The Brearley School, a private girls' school in New York, has
instituted an iPod requirement for about 300 students in grades 7
through 12. Some higher education institutions have similar
requirements, including Duke University and Georgia College and State
University, but this is reportedly the first such program at the
secondary level. Students at Brearley will use the devices primarily
for foreign languages and classics. Students can use their iPods to
keep audio diaries, practice speaking foreign languages, and download
and listen to lessons and other course content. Although the
educational value of the technology remains an unknown quantity,
teachers at Brearley noted that the "wow" factor of the iPods for
teenage girls would likely benefit the initiative. At Duke, which
issued iPods to 1,650 incoming freshmen this fall, the devices are also
used in foreign language classes, among others. Lisa Merschel, who
teaches Spanish at Duke, said she does not "necessarily see a
correlation between using the iPod and an increased fluency in the
language." Still, said Merschel, the iPods "helped me to see how [the
students] were progressing as a class."

IBM SELLS PC UNIT TO CHINESE COMPANY
Following news reports (see Edupage, December 3) on the possibility,
IBM has agreed to sell its personal computer unit to China's largest
PC maker, Lenovo, for $1.75 billion in cash, stock, and debt. IBM will
assume a 18.9 percent stake in Lenovo. The IBM PC business will
continue to be run by its current management team and be based in the
United States. Although based in Beijing, Lenovo plans to establish
headquarters in New York. IBM will continue to handle technical
support, financing, and warranty coverage for its former PC division.

PEOPLESOFT BOARD APPROVES SALE TO ORACLE
After 18 months of wrangling, legal actions, and regulatory review, the
PeopleSoft Board of Directors has approved a buyout offer from Oracle.
The deal is valued at about $10.3 billion, or $26.50 per share, despite
Oracle's insistence that $24 per share was its best offer. The higher
price came after Oracle executives gained access to PeopleSoft's
financial statements and determined the target company was more
profitable than Oracle's earlier estimates. Oracle has promised strong
support for current PeopleSoft customers, as well as those of J.D.
Edwards, which PeopleSoft acquired during the takeover efforts by
Oracle. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said development teams from both
PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards would be retained and would operate
independently. Ellison said updates to applications from both companies
would be developed in the next year or two. Pending legal action over
the merger will be suspended until the transaction is completed, at
which point litigation will be dismissed. The deal is expected to close
at the end of January.

SPACE STATION CREW ENDURES FOOD SHORTAGE

[You spend billions on space programs,
but no one counts how many sandwiches?]

from Houston Chronicle

A food shortage on the international space station means its two crew
members must eat less until a Russian supply capsule arrives Christmas
Day, NASA officials said Thursday.

Supplies are so low that if the usually reliable Progress spacecraft missed
its delivery, American Leroy Chiao and Russian Salizhan Sharipov would be
ordered back to Earth by mid-January, halfway through their six-month mission.

"This Progress is critical, there is no question about that," NASA space
station program manager Bill Gersteinmaier said Thursday.

*Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media

Elderly and Retired Being Called Up To Active Military In Middle East

Some of you heard about the 55 year old woman called up by the army,
but that has now been eclipsed by at least 100 over the age of 60,
and at least one 70 year old has been called up to Afganistan.
"My first reaction was disbelief," the Florida retiree said.
"It never occurred to me that they would call a 70-year-old."
The Department of Defense would not provide exact figures as
to how many senior citizens had been called up.

REPORT CONCLUDES LINUX HAS FEWER FLAWS  [From Newsscan]
A four-year research effort by code-analysis firm Coverity has
concluded that Linux has significantly fewer software bugs in it than most
commercial counterparts. Coverity uncovered 985 flaws in the 5.7 million
lines of code that make up the Linux core operating system, compared with
the more than 5,000 defects typically found in commercial software of
similar size. "Linux is a very good system in terms of bug density," says
Coverity CEO Seth Hallem. Though Coverity's report doesn't contain any
specific data about the frequency of glitches in Microsoft's Windows
operating system, it's likely to add fuel to the debate over which system
-- Linux, Mac OS or Windows -- is most secure. One recent report found that
Red Hat Linux contained fewer critical flaws than Microsoft Windows, while
a Forrester Research study (sponsored by Microsoft) unsurprisingly favored
Microsoft. (CNet News.com 13 Dec 2004)

TREMORS ROCK EARTH DEEP BENEATH SAN ANDREAS FAULT
from San Francisco Chronicle

Mysterious tremors deep beneath the San Andreas Fault near the quake-prone
town of Parkfield are shaking the earth's brittle crust, far below the
region where earthquakes normally strike -- and scientists say they can't
understand what's happening or what the motions mean.

Seismic researchers are monitoring the strange vibrations closely. But
whether the faint underground tremors -- termed "chatter" by some
seismologists -- portend an increased likelihood of a major quake in the
area is an unsolved puzzle.

Robert Nadeau, a geophysicist at the UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory,
has charted more than 110 of the faint vibrations since they were first
detected by the lab's High Resolution Seismic Network in Parkfield three
years ago. What concerns Nadeau and his colleagues is that the epicenter of
the great 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, whose magnitude has been estimated
at 7.8 to 8, was located almost exactly where the deep tremors are now
occurring -- beneath the San Luis Obispo County village of Cholame, some
17 miles south of Parkfield.

ESKIMOS SEEK TO RECAST GLOBAL WARMING AS A RIGHTS ISSUE
from The New York Times (Registration Required)

The Eskimos, or Inuit, about 155,000 seal-hunting peoples scattered around
the Arctic, plan to seek a ruling from the Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights that the United States, by contributing substantially to
global warming, is threatening their existence.

The Inuit plan is part of a broader shift in the debate over human-caused
climate change evident among participants in the 10th round of
international talks taking place in Buenos Aires aimed at averting
dangerous human interference with the climate system.

Inuit leaders said they planned to announce the effort at the climate
meeting today.

About "Google Print"

"This is the day the world changes."
John Wilkin, University of Michigan

"Within two decades, most of the world's knowledge will be digitised
and available, one hopes for free reading on the internet, just as
there is free reading in libraries today."
Michael A. Keller, Head Librarian, Stanford


Ronald Milne, Acting Head Librarian, Bodleian Library, Oxford,
said that this was as important an event as the Gutenberg's
orginal invention of the printing press.  [Does anyone have
the exact quotation. . .I was taking notes from three nearly
simultaneous reports]

[BTW, didn't we hear that a major portion of the Bodleian was
now confortably ensconced deep within a salt mine?  So how is
Google going to scan those?]
