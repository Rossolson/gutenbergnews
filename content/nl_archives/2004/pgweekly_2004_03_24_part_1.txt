*****eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since July 4, 1971******

!!!
Newsletter editors needed!  Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
!!!

Apologies for delays and resends, my cut and past from previous listings
included filetypes you cannot even MENTION in today's emails.
[I hope this soon goes the way of no mention of brxxst cancer research]



                            eBook Milestones

              Our Grand Total Passed 12,000 eBooks !!!


             We Are 1/5 of the Way from 10,000 to 20,000


                     12024 eBooks As Of Today!!!


It took 32.25 years from July, 1971 to October, 2003 to do our 1st 10,000

It took 4.25 years from December, 1999 to March, 2004 for our last 10,000

[From 2,024 to 12,024]  [Footnote:  the most recent 25 files are the new
Human Genome files, and thus are VERY large, may be a few extra minutes
each before they are all available for download. . .but probably should
be ready by the time you get this. . .around noon Central Standard Time]


Another Milestone:  A.C. Nielsen reported this week that US Internet
users topped 200 million for the first time last year, now ~75% of
all American's over the age of 2 have Internet access, up from 66%
a year before.  That's 3/4 of the population, up from 2/3. . . .
In each coming year it should move to 5/6 to 6/7 to 7/8 to 8/9 to 9/10
That would mean 90% of the US would have Internet access before 2010.


[The Newsletter is now being sent in three sections, so you can directly
go to the portions you find most interesting:  1.  Founder's Comments,
2. News, Notes & Queries, and  3. Weekly eBook Update Listing.]

Today, and until we actually GET a new Newsletter editor who want to
do another portion, there will be only 2 parts. . .this is Part 1,
and the eBook listings in Part 2 [New Project Gutenberg Documents].

[Since we are between Newsletter editors, these 3 parts may undergo a
few changes while we are finding a new Newsletter editor.   Email us:
hart@pobox.com and gbnewby@pglaf.org if you would like to volunteer.]


  This is Michael Hart's "Founder's Comments" section of the Newsletter


Over Our 32 3/4 Year History, We Have Now Averaged About 367 Ebooks/Yr

                       Just over 100 per week!!!


By The Way, It's Been About 1.023 Billion Seconds Since The First eBook!!!



***  HOT Requests!!!

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
an *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

*** Continuing Requests For Assistance:

Project Gutenberg--Canada will be starting up soon.
Please let us know if you would like to volunteer!
Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,
and we have volunteers working on both of these.
We will also be seeking volunteers from others of
the "life +50" countries, as it looks as if the
Australian copyright law is falling victim to the
new "Economic Warfare" being waged by the World
Intellectual Property Organization and various
billionaire copyright holders around the world.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://gutenberg.net/list.html  can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer.


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 11 weeks of this year, we have produced 313 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our FIRST 313 eBooks!!!

         That's 11 WEEKS as Compared to ~26 YEARS!!!


With 12,024 eBooks online as of March 23, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.83 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.35 when we had 7420 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 12,000 books each costing $.52 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 12,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 12,024 eBooks in 32 Years and 9.60 Months We Averaged
      367 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       30.5 Per Month
        1.00 Per Day

At 1117 eBooks Done In The 076 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
     14.7 Per Day
    102.9 Per Week
    448.3 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


>From Newsscan:

THE BATTLE OF THE DESKTOP HEATS UP
      For the first time since Netscape hit the market in the 1990s,
Microsoft is facing stiff competition in the computer desktop arena, with
Google and Yahoo eager to depose Microsoft by offering compelling
alternatives designed to guide PC users through the Web. "The Web has
created the equivalent of an operating system layered on top of the
computer's operating system," says former tech magazine publisher John
Battelle. "There is some question of how important that underlying
operating system is going to be in the future." For now, search engines
appear to be the most potent magnet for drawing users' eyeballs -- a
phenomenon that has enabled Google to leapfrog from No. 26 in 2001 to third
place behind Yahoo and Microsoft's MSN without spending anything on
advertising. About 114.5 million Americans, or 39% of the U.S. population,
now use search engines, and businesses spent an estimated $2 billion last
year on search-related advertising. And while Google is currently the dark
horse darling among analysts, Yahoo and Microsoft are pouring millions into
upgrading their search technologies. The rival search engines "may not end
up being as good as Google's, but they could be good enough for most
people," says a Forrester Research analyst. That prospect has Google hard
at work on ratcheting up its own technology, says director of technology
Craig Silverstein. "If someone should come along and do a better job than
us, we know people will switch in a heartbeat." (AP 22 Mar 2004)
http://apnews.excite.com/article/20040322/D81FHFIG0.html

[And in a related story]

THE DESKTOP WARS: GOOGLE, YAHOO, AND MICROSOFT
     John Battelle, author of a forthcoming book on the rise of online
search, thinks that the era of the operating system is over: "The Web has
created the equivalent of an operating system layered on top of the
computer's operating system. There is some question how important that
underlying operating system is going to be in the future." And so the new
combatants for control of the computer desktop are Yahoo and Google and
Microsoft's MSN. The fiercest contender may be Google, with an audience
nearly six times larger than it was in early 2001, but both Yahoo and
Microsoft think they'll be able to build a better search engine than Google.
Microsoft MSN director Lisa Gurry says: "Our customers tell us that no one
is doing a very good job with search right now. Our own internal data
indicates 50% of search questions go unanswered, so we think there are some
great opportunities ahead." (AP/USA Today 23 Mar 2004)

[50%???  Wow!  I didn't realize the success rate was that low!]

EUROPEANS TO SANCTION MICROSOFT
The European Union (EU) is about to sanction U.S. software maker Microsoft
for violating EU's competition rules, leaving that company under broad
sanctions for two or three years while it pursues the appeals process.
EU Competition Commission Mario Monti said: "In the end, I had to decide
what was best for competition and consumers in Europe." Microsoft CEO Steve
Balmer reaction was: "We were unable to agree on principles for new issues
that could arise in the future. I hope that perhaps we can still settle this
case at a later stage." (Los Angeles Times 19 Mar 2004)

IEEE WORRIED ABOUT OUTSOURCING
The U.S. wing of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE) is concerned about the "offshoring" trend, and John Steadman, the
group's president, says: "We must develop a coordinated national strategy to
maintain U.S. technological leadership and promote job growth in the United
States. But it's going to be difficult to remain technologically
competitive, if we continue offshoring the jobs of our innovators at rates
currently projected." The group is recommending that federal investments and
tax credits for research and development be limited to work performed in the
U.S.; it is also making the point that H-1B and L-1 visa programs are
frequently used to bring in cheaper labor that can lead to the displacement
of U.S. professionals, exploitation of foreign workers, and "accelerated
offshoring of engineering and other high-tech jobs."

POWELL REASSURES INDIA ABOUT OUTSOURCING
     U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has reassured India that the Bush
administration will not try to halt the outsourcing of high-technology jobs
to that country. Powell explained that American concerns about outsourcing,
as expressed in political complaints, were not surprising: "Outsourcing is a
natural effect of the global economic system and the rise of the Internet
and broadband communications. You're not going to eliminate outsourcing;
but, at the same time, when you outsource jobs it becomes a political issue
in anybody's country." David Wade, a spokesman for the Kerry campaign, said
that Powell's remarks demonstrated that the Bush administration has "failed
to fight for American workers"; White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said,
"The secretary made clear in his remarks that we are concerned when
Americans lose jobs, and we are focused on creating jobs for American
workers, and the best way to do that is to open markets around the world,
including in India." (New York Times 17 Mar 2004)

TELECOM REVOLUTION?
Skype, a California start-up created by Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis
(founders of the Internet file-swapping service Kazaa), is developing
software to make it possible for free phone calls to be made anywhere in the
world. Swedish-born Zennstrom and Friis, a citizen of Finland, decided to
adapt peer-to-peer technology to telecommunications: "We sat down and we had
talked about this for a long time. Where can we use this technology to solve
some real problems and take advantage of the competitive advantages of
disruptive technology? With peer-to-peer, whether we have 1 million or 10
million or 100 million users, our cost is pretty much the same. We can
provide it for free, because we don't have any costs for it." Venture
capitalist Timothy Draper says, "This is a major phenomenon that's going to
spread throughout the world," and he predicts that Skype will have "a really
tremendous business." Independent telecom analyst Daniel Berning says that
"the basic technology that they're applying, that's the way phones will work
in the future." (San Jose Mercury News 18 Mar 2004)

WIRELESS FLAT-PANEL TV
     Sharp is introducing the world's first wireless flat-panel television,
a $1600 set that can be carried anywhere in your house as you move from room
to room. But one reviewer notes: "Sharp's LC-15L1U is a natural purchase
only for a unique demographic group: those with big video budgets but
smallish apartments. For everyone else, the new Aquos is best considered a
technology demonstration, like a concept car." The reviewer decides that
though the Aquos may be groundbreaking, innovative and wireless, "it's also
somewhat impractical." (New York Times 18 Mar 2004)

HP LAUNCH OF LINUX PCs IN ASIA
Hewlett-Packard has become the first major PC maker to offer to
consumers in Asia desktop computer lines running Linux -- a move that now
makes HP a serious threat to Microsoft's dominance in that part of the
world. (Japanese, South Korean and Chinese officials have long been worrying
that their countries are too dependent on Microsoft's Windows systems.) The
HP Linux computers will be distributed by Turbolinux and sold in 12 Asian
locations: China, Hong Kong, Japan, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

IT'S OFFICIAL: TOSHIBA'S TEENY HARD DRIVE IS WORLD'S SMALLEST
Guinness World Records has certified that Toshiba's .85-inch hard
disk drive is the smallest in the world. The company says the tiny drives
squeeze up to 4 gigabytes of storage into a stamp-sized device that will
find a use in products such as cell phones and digital camcorders.
"Toshiba's innovation means that I could soon hold more information in my
watch than I could on my desktop computer just a few years ago," says
Guinness science and technology editor David Hawksett. (Reuters 16 Mar 2004)

ISPs STRUGGLE TO FIND FIX FOR SPAM
Unless you've been hibernating the last six months, you know that spam not
only is a consumer headache -- it's turning into a corporate nightmare.
U.S. companies spend an estimated $1 billion a year in extra [costs]. . . .

[Of course, if this were only a consumer problem, such as well over 100 lbs
of junk mail that appears annually in the average home snailmailbox, then
the corporations [who send all that junkmail] wouldn't give a hoot; neither
would the government.  It's OK for them to spam us, not the other way.]

[Pay Up or Sue Me!!!]  [Is this legal blackmail?]

UNIVERSITIES FACE PATENT ISSUES FOR ONLINE TESTING
An undisclosed number of colleges and universities have received
letters from a company called Test Central saying that it holds a
patent on online testing and that the schools are in violation of that
patent. Ellen K. Waterman of Regis University, one of the institutions
threatened by the company, called the letter extremely broad,
potentially covering any type of testing online. An official from Test
Central rejected that characterization but said he believes "that other
people are profiting at our expense." Test Central's patent, for which
it applied in February 1999, was granted in early 2003. According to
Rita S. Heimes, a visiting assistant professor of law at Suffolk
University Law School, a patent can be effectively challenged by
showing prior use of the patented technology. Many institutions engaged
in online testing prior to 1999, but, said Heimes, because the cost of
fighting the patent in court could be extremely expensive, many
institutions will simply opt to pay licensing fees.

LAPTOPS FOR ALL STUDENTS
A charity organization in Britain called Citizens Online has called on
that country's government to provide laptop computers to all school
children by 2010. A report from the group contends that "the very
process of education is dependent on technology," and bridging the
digital divide is one of the group's primary goals. Currently, only
half of the homes in the United Kingdom have Internet access. The
group's report also urges the government to fund efforts to help
people in the United Kingdom with disabilities gain computer and
Internet access. Programs to provide all students with computers have
been tried in several parts of the United Kingdom, with mixed results.
In some cases, school children with computers have become easy targets
for thieves.   BBC, 18 March 2004

PDF-ARCHIVE PUSHED AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD
Corporate and government officials are working on a variation of PDF
specifications to create an archive-friendly format for documents.
Representatives from companies including Eastman Kodak, IBM, and Xerox
are participating in developing the new format, called PDF-Archive
(PDF-A), with Adobe Systems, creator of the original PDF. Also involved
in the project is Stephen Levenson, judiciary records officer for the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The archival challenges
facing Levenson in the current era of vastly expanding numbers of
electronic documents have urged him to join in the work to create what
he said will be a slimmed-down version of PDF. PDF-A, which is based on
PDF 1.4, will include type fonts and other features to ensure the
documents are viewable by a wide range of applications in the future.
PDF-A also will be designed to shield PDF documents from becoming
security threats by prohibiting proprietary encryption schemes and
embedded executable files.

IBM AND NAPSTER WORK TO PRESERVE BANDWIDTH
Recently relaunched music service Napster and IBM this week announced a
new "Super Peer" application designed to keep peer-to-peer file trading
from eating up huge portions of a network's bandwidth. Napster has
several university customers, including the University of Rochester and
Penn State University, and the new application stores the most
frequently traded tracks on servers at those locations. The application
runs on IBM's eServer BladeCenter systems. Users who download those
tracks get them from the local server rather than from the Internet,
saving the network's bandwidth for applications that depend on it.
According to Bill Pence, Napster's chief technology officer, the new
system would keep about 90 percent of the roughly 100,000 daily
downloads at Penn State from using up valuable Internet bandwidth,
saving the university about $50,000 in access fees annually.

[Me and Valenti again]

REPORT RECOMMENDS BALANCE IN COPYRIGHT ISSUES
A new report from a policy group in Washington is likely to add fuel to
the debate over copyright in the digital age. The report from the
Committee for Economic Development argues that although digital media
open new doors for copyright infringement, the solution should lie with
"clear, concentrated thinking, rather than quick legislative or
regulatory action." At least some of the restrictions on electronic
content proposed by the entertainment industry are likely to disturb
the balance between content owners and the public, according to the
report. Debora L. Spar of Harvard Business School noted that
conceptions of "a more liberal regime of copyright" are becoming more
mainstream, not just "a wacky idea cloistered in the ivory tower," but
that the existing system of copyright is far from simply being thrown
out. Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture Association of America said
that although he had not seen the report, the notion that efforts by
the entertainment industry to protect copyright will stifle innovation
are "malarkey."
