go to the portions you find most interesting:  1.  Founder's Comments,
News, Notes & Queries, and  2. Weekly eBook Update Listing.]

Today, and until we actually GET new Newsletter editors who want to
do another portion, there will be only 2 parts. . .this is Part 1,

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
and *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 28 weeks of this year, we have produced 2395 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 2395 eBooks!!!

          That's 28 WEEKS as Compared to ~29 YEARS!!!


With 13,295 eBooks online as of July 14, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.75 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.15 when we had 8705 eBooks a year Ago

Can you imagine ~13,295 books each costing ~$.40 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~13,295 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 13,295 eBooks in 33 Years and 00.50 Months We Averaged
       402 Per Year   [We do nearly that much a month these days!]
        33.5 Per Month
         1.10 Per Day

At 2388 eBooks Done In The 202 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      12 Per Day
      86 Per Week
     367 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

>From NewsScan:

LINKED: THE AOL, MSN, & YAHOO MESSAGING SYSTEMS

[Of the corporation, by the corporation, for the corporation.]
[This will NOT work for the rest of us.]

The separate messaging services offered by AOL, MSN, and Yahoo are
being linked so that corporate computer users can communicate with one
another no matter which systems they use. Companies will have to license
new Microsoft network software that will serve as the hub connecting the three
messaging systems. Industry analyst Nate Root of Forrester Research says:
"This is a very significant announcement. The value here is for corporations.
Corporations will now have the ability to span the instant messaging landscape."
But he notes that the arrangement does not reach "the holy grail of instant
messaging, which is to allow anybody on any network to send a message to
anybody on any other network." The three companies have no plans at this time
to allow users outside the workplace to communicate with one another over
different instant message systems. (Washington Post 14 Jul 2004)

GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN: RFID USED TO TAG EMPLOYEES
RFID tags have been implanted under the skin of Mexico's top federal
prosecutors and investigators to give them quick access to restricted areas
inside a new federal anti-crime information center. The chips also could
provide more certainty about who accessed sensitive data at any given time.
(In the past, the biggest security problem for Mexican law enforcement has
been corruption by officials themselves.) The microchip tags lie dormant
under the skin until read by an electromagnetic scanner, which uses a
technology known as radio frequency identification (RFID) that's now
commonly used for inventory control. (San Jose Mercury News 14 Jul 2004)

GOV. REMOVES PART OF S. DAKOTA LIBRARY SITE
South Dakota Governor Mike Rounds has had the teen section of the State
Library's Web site shut down because it provided links to material he
doesn't believe young people should see. The links to which he found
objection included one to a Planned Parenthood site and one to Columbia
University's Go Ask Alice! Rounds said: "As a parent, I would be very
disturbed to have my children connecting to any of these Web sites." His
position is that state government should not feature links to any advocacy
groups and that removal of the links isn't censorship because users can
still go directly to those organizations' sites. (AP/13 Jul 2004)

BUSH SIGNS IDENTITY THEFT BILL
President Bush has signed into law an identity theft bill that will add
two years to the prison sentences of criminals convicted of using stolen
credit card numbers or other personal data to commit crimes. On top of that,
the sentences of identity-theft violators who then commit acts of terrorism
will be extended by an additional five years. The Federal Trade Commission
estimates that 27.3 million Americans have been victims of identity theft in
the last five years. (Washington Post 15 Jul 2004)

DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN WORLDWIDE PC SALES
Market research firm IDC in Framingham, Mass. reports double-digit
growth in worldwide sales of personal computers for the fifth consecutive
quarter. IDC executive Loren Loverde explained that "demand in Europe,
supported by the strong euro and aggressive promotions, was the biggest
driver of the quarter." The top five worldwide vendors were (in this order):
Dell, HP, IBM, Fujitsu, and Acer. Acer showed the greatest growth (about
30%) from the year-ago quarter. (San Jose Mercury News 15 Jul 2004)

WIRELESS GOES QWERTY
The success of multifunction devices such as Blackberry, PalmOne's Treo 600,
and Sidekick has inspired new qwerty-keyboard models from Sony Ericsson,
Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft: Sony Ericsson's P910 offers a fold-down
keyboard useful for sending long e-mail messages; HP and Danger have
developed devices with qwerty-style keyboards; and Microsoft will be
introducing a qwerty-keyboard device called the Pocket PC. Why the interest
in qwerty keypads? Consultant Andrew Seybold says, "In Europe and in Asia,
where the teenagers grew up with triple tapping, they got used to it. In the
U.S. the percentage of people who started out on keyboard is much higher and
that drives what they are used to on a handheld device." The Treo is the only
qwerty handset now being offered by all five major U.S. cellular carriers,
and PalmOne executive Joe Fabris boasts: "The Treo seems to be in the
Goldilocks zone: it's just the right size. We're in the refinement stage
and we're hammering ahead. Other people are still exploring." (New York Times)

LINDOWS INSPIRED TO CHANGE ITS NAME FOR $20 MILLION
Microsoft has settled its trademark infringement lawsuits against
Lindows with a $20 million payment to that Linux operating system company --
which will now change its name to Linspire. Microsoft says, "We are pleased
that Lindows will now compete in the market place with a name distinctly its
own." Lindows has four years to continue using two of its Web addresses:
www.lindows.com and www.lindowsinc.com   for the purpose of redirecting
visitors to its new Web sites. (AP/USA Today 19 Jul 2004)

PIRACY REPORT STIRS CONTROVERSY
A recent report by the Business Software Alliance (BSA) about the cost
of software piracy has prompted some to suggest a political motive for
the report. Two weeks ago, the BSA issued a report that estimated
annual losses to software piracy at $29 billion. To some, however, the
timing of the report--released not long after a Senate bill was
introduced that would significantly strengthen copyright law--was not
merely coincidental. Opponents of the Senate bill argued that it would
effectively invalidate a Supreme Court decision that protects those who
develop technology that could be--but is not necessarily--used for
copyright violations. Overturning that precedent, said critics, would
only serve to protect interests of copyright holders and would stifle
technological innovation. Critics of the bill contend that the BSA,
which has previously estimated losses to piracy at $13 billion,
exaggerated the amount and released the report at a time that it would
influence senators considering the bill. Supporters of the bill said it
is sufficiently focused to target egregious violators of copyright. The
BSA defended the new estimate, saying the data that led to the higher
number were more comprehensive than in previous studies.

HOUSE COMMITTEE ENCOURAGES OPEN-ACCESS PUBLISHING
The U.S. House Appropriations Committee has issued a report that urges
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to offer free, public access to
research it funds. While not a requirement, the recommendation gives
supporters of open access a significant boost and has left publishers
scrambling to try to change the report before it is approved by
Congress. The report encourages the NIH to make research available free
within six months of publication and directs the NIH to report back to
the committee by December 1, 2004, on how it plans to comply. Some
academic groups and librarians have long been pushing for such an open
model for scholarly publishing, especially as prices for many academic
journals have risen sharply. Since the report was issued, the
Association of American Publishers has been working to persuade members
of Congress to reject the open-access language in the report,
particularly the request for a report on compliance. Barbara Meredith
of the association, which said it was not consulted for input in the
writing of the report, said that establishing open-access publishing
for all government-funded research is "not in the best interest of
business and readers."

CONTENTION OVER CELL PHONE 411 DATABASE
A planned directory-assistance database of cell-phone numbers is
raising concerns among civil liberties groups and industry analysts
about protecting the privacy of cell-phone users. Officials from the
Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association (CTIA) said the
411 directory would require customers to opt-in to be included and so
presents no risk to individual privacy. Some critics, however, question
whether the directory could have sufficient enrollment to be
sustainable unless an opt-out approach is used. Verizon Wireless has
said it will not provide its customers' names and numbers to the
directory, but the company's user agreement says that Verizon may
submit customer numbers to a directory unless users pay a fee to be
excluded. According to Adam Goldberg of Consumers Union, in such a
situation, Verizon could at any time decide to change its policy and
the user agreements could be taken as permission to opt-in to the
directory. Because of the uncertainties surrounding the directory and
its implementation, some are calling on the Federal Communications
Commission to regulate the directory. Officials from CTIA argued that
government regulation is not necessary, saying the list will only be
opt-in and that no fees will be charged to be either included or
excluded from the directory.

DELL, HP UP THE ANTE FOR RECYCLING PROGRAMS
Leading computer manufacturers Dell and Hewlett-Packard have announced
new recycling initiatives for computers and other electronics. From
late July until early September, HP will accept PCs and other
electronic devices at Office Depot locations across the country for no
charge. Under Dell's offer, the company will pick up old computers and
accessories from homes. There is also no charge for Dell's recycling
program, but to qualify for the program, consumers must purchase a new
computer from the company. The fact that two of the largest computer
makers are competing for the title of most environmentally friendly
contrasts with the state of affairs not long ago, when most
manufacturers fought the notion that they should bear some
responsibility for recycling old hardware. According to Kate Krebs,
executive director of the National Recycling Coalition, "They started a
year ago with their arms across their chests saying no and here they
are now almost competing."

SIX MORE SCHOOLS TO OFFER NAPSTER ON CAMPUS
Six institutions--Cornell University, George Washington University,
Middlebury College, the University of Miami, the University of Southern
California, and Wright State University--will begin providing Napster
online music services to student this fall, joining Pennsylvania State
University and the University of Rochester. Terms were not released,
and conditions of the service vary by campus. At some schools, for
example, all students can access the service, while at others, it is
restricted to on-campus students. Student demand for the service was
cited by several institutions as a driving factor, and many also
expressed a desire to offer a legal alternative to P2P file-sharing and
to discourage copyright violations. Other companies including CFlix,
which provides movies as well as music, and Ruckus Network are also
working to sign up colleges and universities for their services.
Meanwhile, Virginia Tech has signed a site license with Apple Computer
so its students can purchase songs from the company's iTunes service
without being part of a subscription service.

WHITE COLLAR CRIME OUTRANKS BLUE COLLAR 50 TIMES OVER


Apparently for every $25 billion in U.S. "blue collar" crime,
there is $1 trillion in "white collar crime."

Yet the police and court systems seem to act as if those
figures were in reverse.

SIMPLE SOLUTION OF THE WEEK
[From one of our readers]

Is it just me or does anyone else find it absolutely amazing
that the U.S. government can track a cow born in Canada
almost three years ago, right to the stall where she sleeps
in the state of Washington, and determine exactly what that
cow ate. They can also track her calves right to their stalls,
and tell you what kind of feed they ate.

But they are unable to locate 11 million illegal aliens
wandering around in their country, including people that are
trying to blow up important structures in the U.S.

My solution is to give every illegal alien a cow as soon as
they enter the country.
