*** TWO Headline Stories from July 8th ***


``Literary reading is in dramatic decline with fewer than half of American
adults now reading literature, according to a National Endowment for the
Arts (NEA) survey released today [July 8, 2004]. Reading at Risk: A Survey
of Literary Reading in America reports drops in all groups studied, with
the steepest rate of decline - 28 percent - occurring in the youngest age
groups. The study also documents an overall decline of 10 percentage points
in literary readers from 1982 to 2002, representing a loss of 20 million
potential readers. The rate of decline is increasing and, according to the
survey, has nearly tripled in the last decade. The findings were announced
today by NEA Chairman Dana Gioia during a news conference at the New York
Public Library.'' (from the NEA summary, by Ann Puderbaugh)

*

[In response to this decline in reading, the Thoreau Society, caretakers
of one of the greatest legacies of literature and personal freedom, has
law enforcement personnel protecting their physical and literary turf,
as below, in a move that must have Henry David Thoreau rotating rapdily
enough in his grave to require high-endurance motor oil.]

Here is Supreme Court Plaintiff Eric Eldred's personal account of this,
reprinted with his permission:

On Thu, 8 Jul 2004, Eric Eldred wrote:

Today (July 8, 2004) I took the Internet Bookmobile to Walden Pond in
Concord, Mass.  It is the 150th anniversary of H. D. Thoreau's book
"Walden."  The Thoreau Society is having a dawn to dusk reading.
After an hour of having readers print and take away free copies of
"Walden," I was asked by the Walden Pond Reservation police to
pack up and leave and threatened with arrest.  I left.

The park superintendent told me I could not pass out free literature
without a permit.  And she would not give me a permit because, as she
explained, the state park gets money from a concession by the Thoreau
Society, which operates a store that sells "Walden"--and I was competing
with them by giving away free copies.

There is no place to park at Walden Pond except in the state parking lot,
for which I paid $5.

Integral to the Internet Bookmobile concept is showing citizens how
we can become our own publishers by means of the free Internet and
new print-on-demand technology.   It is not just giving away free
books--readers actually learn how to make the books themselves.
It promotes the sharing ethos of the Internet and free culture and
therefore is a threat to the established publishing industry and the
media giants that control our culture.  The Internet Bookmobile is
sponsored by the Internet Archive and Anywhere Books.

Evidently members of the Thoreau Society, charged with his legacy,
are now in the business of making money off him and are using their
political power to suppress the free culture of which he would be
proud.  The government trustees of the land, who once jailed Thoreau,
are now more interested in making money themselves instead of helping
to spread his message.  Shame.

Teachers and librarians and ordinary citizens need to master new
technology and use it for appropriate purposes.  We can use these
tools to further our culture.  But we can't do so if we are
threatened with arrest for giving away "Walden."  I am having
difficulty getting invitations to schools and libraries for the
Bookmobile; I wonder why.  Learn about the Internet Archive
Bookmobile at http://www.archive.org/texts/bookmobile.php and
http://www.archive.org/iathreads/uploaded-files/EricEldred-flyer.pdf

The book I wanted to give away is formatted at
http://eldritchpress.org/Walden5.sxw (or .doc)  (It works best if you
have Baskerville Old Face font--sorry, I wasn't able to save a good
PDF version from OpenOffice.)

And from a later message:

Walden exists online in several other formats, such as in
Project Gutenberg and the Electronic Text Center of Virginia.

Now is a good time to read or re-read the book, don't you think?

[End of Eric Eldred's comments]

***and two more***

[My friends can tell you that I predicted this the first time I heard
of cheap RFID tags for dogs. . .it was only a matter of time before a
movement to keep track of people would use the same kind of RFID tag]

RADIO KIDS IN JAPAN
School officials in the Japanese city of Osaka will soon be using RFID
technology to monitor the movements of their pupils. (The acronym stands for
radio frequency identification.) The tags, which will be read by readers
installed at various key locations throughout a school, will be placed on
the children's schoolbags, name tags, or clothing. (CNET 12 Jul 2004)

[See story below for similar technology to keep track of convicted rapists]



***$600 Terabytes!!!


Without even the need for a rebate, Staples has $150 250G drives.

This reduces the over the counter cost of a Terabyte to $600,
and no longer requires a special controller to handle more than
four drives.


***  HOT Requests!!!


We're working up a team to read our eBooks into MP3 files
for the visually impaired and other audio book users.

Let us know if you'd like to join this group.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
and *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

if someone would be willing to make one.

Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby <gbnewby AT pglaf.org> ,
if you can help.

This is much more important than many of us realize!

We're still keeping up with Moore's Law!

Moore's Law 12 month percentage =  91%

Moore's Law 18 month percentage =  96%

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 27 weeks of this year, we have produced 2319 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 2319 eBooks!!!

          That's 27 WEEKS as Compared to ~29 YEARS!!!


With 13,226 eBooks online as of July 14, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.76 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.16 when we had 8628 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine ~13,225 books each costing ~$.40 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~13,225 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 13,225 eBooks in 33 Years and 00.25 Months We Averaged
       400 Per Year   [We do nearly that much a month these days!]
        33.4 Per Month
         1.10 Per Day

At 2318 eBooks Done In The 195 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      12 Per Day
      87 Per Week
     370 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.


***Headline News***

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

>From NewsScan:

AMERICANS FLOCK TO GRAPHIC WAR IMAGES ONLINE
About one in four American Internet users sought out graphic war images
that were deemed too gruesome to display in conventional media such as
newspapers and television, according to new research by the Pew Internet
Project. The results were drawn from a telephone survey conducted between
May 14 and June 17 -- a period that encompassed such disturbing events as
the murder and dismemberment of American contract workers in Fallujah, the
exposure of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, and the capture and beheading of
U.S. civilian Nicholas Berg. Survey respondents reported mixed feelings
after viewing the images -- 51% said they felt they'd made a good decision
to access the images, but a third said they wished they hadn't seen them.
"Millions of Internet users want to be able to view the graphic war images
and they see the Internet as an alternative source of news and information
from traditional media. But many who do venture outside the traditional and
familiar standards of the mainstream news organizations to look at the
images online end up feeling very uncomfortable," says report co-author
Deborah Fallows. Women in particular seemed more troubled over the entire
issue of graphic online images, while younger adult Internet users tended
to approve their availability.

CHINA BACKS DOWN ON CHIP DISPUTE
China has agreed to end a tax break that the U.S. charged unfairly
favored computer chips produced or designed in China. The settlement of
high-profile dispute, which played out under the auspices of the World
Trade Organization, could pave the way for better relations between the
U.S. and China and may encourage China to refrain from using similar
preferences to favor other industries. "The line had to be drawn here,"
says Frank Vargo, VP for international economic affairs for the National
Association of Manufacturers. "If China had been allowed to continue this
patently unfair treatment of imported semiconductors, it could well have
sought to expand this practice to a growing range of manufacturing
industries. This isn't just about semiconductors -- even as important as
that industry is." Currently, China imports 80% of its chips because its
domestic semiconductor industry is still small, although rapidly expanding.
The repeal of the tax break will be especially helpful to smaller U.S.
semiconductor companies, which compete against Chinese chipmakers to
provide chips for consumer electronics and other lower-tech industries,
says industry analyst David Wu. "It's not really going to help Intel,
because they make parts that China would have to buy anyway."

[Won't this just encourage the Chinese to make more of their own
chips and import even less?  Thus it would be self-defeating in
terms of supporting "smaller U.S. semiconductor companies."]

IN HOT PURSUIT OF FASTER COMPUTERS
To help the U.S. regain an edge in high-performance supercomputing, the
House of Representatives has passed two bills to encourage the development
high-speed supercomputers for use by automakers, drug makers and other major
industries. Noting Japan's introduction of the world's fastest computer in
2002, House Science Committee Chairman Boehlert (R, NY) says: "What the
Japanese have done is send a strong signal as a reminder to all of us that
this is a very competitive marketplace."

HOOKED FOR RENTING OUT PRIVATE CUSTOMER DATA
The Hooked on Phonics company, which markets learning systems, has
settled a complaint by the Federal Trade Commission that the company rented
out customer data to outside marketers even though it had promised on its
Web site that it would keep the information private. The FTC's J. Howard
Beales III says: "It's simple: If you collect information and promise not to
share, you can't share unless the consumer agrees." But Chris Jay Hoofnagle
of the Electronic Privacy Information Center criticizes the FTC on the
grounds that the Agency is in effect pushing companies to have the fewest
restrictions possible without alienating potential customers: "The obvious
encouragement here is to not make promises. We think that approach is
somewhat inflexible." (Washington Post 7 Jul 2004)

THE GROWING AUTO INDUSTRY MARKET FOR MICROCHIPS TOKYO
Gartner Research is predicting that, as electronics become the main
driver of car innovation, chip makers will be a major beneficiary. Gartner
executive Mike Williams says: "Because penetration of electronics in cars is
still quite low, we expect to see growth [in chip demand] coming from
further penetration," and Drue Freeman of Philips Semiconductors adds:
"Electronics is where car makers can really start to do innovation and they
can differentiate their cars from competition. Also, the use of more
electronics and semiconductors will actually help reduce the costs that car
makers have to spend in building cars." (Reuters/USA Today 8 Jul 2004)

Tennessee has budgeted $2.5 million for a pilot project that will test

system would let law enforcement build maps with "zones of exclusion" for
the offenders (such as playgrounds, schools, day-care centers or the homes
of victims), and would allow probation officers to determine whether the
felons they are supervising are going to work during the day, going home at
night, and staying away from restricted areas. (The Tennessean 12 Jul 2004)

"WHISTLEBLOWER" LAWSSUIT FILED AGAINST DIEBOLD
Opponents of electronic voting are suing Diebold Inc. under a
California whistleblower law, accusing Diebold of defrauding the state by
providing shoddy balloting equipment that exposed California elections to
vandals and to software bugs. The individuals who filed the suit are Jim
March, a programmer, and Bev Harris, an activist. Under the whistleblower
statute, the two could collect up to 30% of any reimbursement. March says:
"This is about money now -- a case of the capitalist system at work. The
laws on voting products and processes are unfortunately unclear. But the law
on defrauding the government is really, really clear. Going after the money
trail is cleaner than going after proper procedures." But some critics of
Diebold are equally critical of March and Harris. One of them says, "I would
like to see people support a real solution rather than just try to cash in.
There are a lot of people who could be a tremendous asset, but they're
grandstanding and reveling in the expose." (San Jose Mercury News 12 Jul 2004)

OUTSOURCING OUTRAGE GOING OUT OF STYLE

The clamor against the outsourcing to India of computer software and
back-office services appears to have faded substantially. Infosys chief
executive Nandan M. Nilekani says: "The backlash against outsourcing has
abated, customer spending is on the rise, and we have redesigned ourselves
internally to take advantage of the vast opportunities." According to Sunil
Mehta of India's leading software industry trade body: "The debate about
outsourcing appears to have moved from an emotional, anecdotal, job-losses
plane to a more sober, balanced one about the advantages of globalization of
services." Ironically, the anti-outsourcing clamor in the U.S. has actually
turned out to be good for the outsourcing business. Partha Iyengar, research
director for Gartner explains: "The backlash proved a gold mine of free
publicity for Indian outsourcing companies," and the U.S.-based CEO of iGate
Global Solutions (operates in Bangalore, India) says: "The backlash issue
made outsourcing so mainstream that even my barber was speaking
knowledgeably about outsourcing." (New York Times 14 Jul 2004)

SUPERCOMPUTING BILLS CLEAR HOUSE
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed two bills aimed at
improving supercomputing facilities and programs in the United States.
The High-Performance Computing Revitalization Act of 2004 would
coordinate all federal supercomputing projects under the authority of
the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy and would
require the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy's
Office of Science to make supercomputing facilities available to
researchers. Under the other bill, called the Department of Energy
High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004, the secretary of energy
would develop top-level supercomputing facilities, which would be
accessible to researchers from industry, academe, and federal agencies.
The bill authorizes $165 million for the project, but the funds would
still need to be appropriated through other legislation. The Computing
Research Association, a group that represents academic and commercial
researchers, praised the House's approval of the bills but noted that
federal funding for information technology projects has frequently
fallen short of targets.

FEDERAL PROGRAM PUSHES SCIENCE EDUCATION

[U.S. students fall from top echelon to bottom between 4th & 8th grade.]

U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham this week announced the
Scientists Teaching and Reaching Students program, which is intended to
support and foster interest in math and science programs among the
country's middle and high school students. According to the Third
International Mathematics and Science Study, U.S. students, who are
among the top-performing students in the world in math and science at
the 4th-grade level, fall nearly to the bottom of the list by 12th
grade. The new program will award scholarships for math and science
teachers to study at the nation's labs, including Los Alamos, Lawrence
Livermore, and Sandia National Laboratories. In addition, those labs
will host 2,000 5th- and 8th-grade students for at least one day a
year. For a number of years, U.S. colleges and universities have seen
steadily declining numbers of students in science programs, and the
effect of the new program on this trend is not clear. Countries such as
India, China, and Russia currently graduate significantly more science
and engineering students than the United States.

HOUSE STANDS BY PATRIOT ACT, BARELY
Efforts to overturn portions of the USA PATRIOT Act were rejected by
the U.S. House of Representatives this week, as lawmakers responded to
a veto threat from the White House. One portion of the PATRIOT Act
lowers the bar for federal officials to obtain records from libraries
and book stores about the habits of their patrons. Civil libertarians
and many in Congress have taken issue with those powers of the law,
calling them unconstitutional, and Reps. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) and
C.L. Butch Otter (R-Idaho) had led the push to repeal those powers.
Even without the PATRIOT Act, said critics, investigators can obtain
similar records from libraries or book stores if probable cause is
shown. The PATRIOT Act allows the government to force disclosure of
records without showing such cause. The effort to block that portion of
the law appeared to have the majority support needed to pass, but 10
Republican lawmakers were persuaded to change their minds, resulting in
a vote of 210-210.

ACADEMICS GET BEHIND REVISIONS TO DMCA
Five academic library organizations, as well as the Association of
American Universities, have joined the Personal Technology Freedom
Coalition, which is working to gain passage of legislation that would
revise portions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The
Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act would allow exemptions for fair
use from the provision of the DMCA that bans circumvention of
antipiracy measures, and it would broaden a current exemption from the
anticircumvention provision for certain types of research. Joining the
coalition to revise the law are the American Association of Law
Libraries, the American Library Association, the Association of
Research Libraries, the Medical Library Association, and the Special
Libraries Association. The bill may come up for a vote during the
current Congressional session, though it is opposed by the chair of the
House Judiciary Committee, which claims jurisdiction over the bill.

More Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media


Report on Intelligence Community:  "Put It In With The Garbage"

Those of you who follow the Washington Press Corps to any degree
already know the phrase, "Put it in with the garbage" refers to
releasing news bad to the current administration on a Friday.

Friday news programs are the least watched of the weekday evening
news reports and it is always hoped that the news will "blow over"
by Monday, having been replaced by something else.  The real dread
is that the next few days will be "slow news days" that do not
provide any distractions from the bad news.

Even counting all the weekend panel news discussions, the Friday
news cycle has been determined to have the least public effect,
since so many people are travelling, partying, going to movies,
etc., during the Friday editions of the evening news.

FAA Official Says Air Defenses Are Up to Standards
Even After Incident Over Capital Showed Potential
For Realistic Catastrophic Interagency Failures

Thursday, July 9, 2004

A month after the fact, the VP of the Federal Aviation Administration
finally addressed the situation on June 8 that resulted in scrambling
of F-15's to possibly shoot down Governor Fletcher of Kentucky.

Even though the F-15's were already patrolling, due to the upcoming
funeral of President Reagan, they never managed to get in position,
even with a several minute head start, and thus the governor needed
no protection from them, should the scramble not have been called off.

Various failures in interagency sharing of intelligence and tools
were cited as the cause, in addition to common courtesy usually
given to heads of our state governments flying to Washington, D.C.

As a result, the Capitol was evacuated for some time.

There have been repeated examples of planes flying over Washington
either undetected or without the possibility of successful aircraft
scrambling to intercept them, this is just the most recent example.

During the Clinton presidency a private plane actually crashed on
the White House grounds killing the pilot and doing some damage
to the White House, with wreckage ending up very close to the
presidential sleeping quarters, which usually would have been
occupied at 2:00 in the morning.

The only casualties appear to have been a 160 year old magnolia
and some White House window glass, and several yards of turf,
as well as the pilot and the aircraft.  The plane was reported
to have been stolen from a small airfield north of Baltimore.

Apparently only 14 seconds elapsed between spotting the plane and
the time of the crash.

White House security armed with shoulder-mounted Stinger missiles
were never reported to have been in position to fire in this,
or any other of the examples I could find.

This wasn't all that easy to find, as a Google Search of "White
House" and "Plane Crash" didn't turn up anything in the first
several 10 item searches.
