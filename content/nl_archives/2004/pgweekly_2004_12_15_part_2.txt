.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

>From David Price, about #14354, Gwaith Samuel Roberts, by Samuel Roberts:

For those interested: Samuel Roberts (known as S.R.) was born in 1800 in
the Welsh village of Llanbryn-mair.  A radical, he had great influence in
Wales through his journal Y Cronicl.  Denouncing slavery, the Crimean
war, he advocated votes for women, universal suffrage and the building of
railways(!) Frustated with the political oppression he encountered from
vested interests in Wales he emigrated to Tennessee in 1857 - with others
from his village. Their new life gradually fell apart (they were a long
way from other Welsh-speakers in America, were duped etc.).  Eventually
Samuel had to return to Wales, to be met with scorn and ridicule.  He
died in 1885.

His literary output was vast and this selection from his works includes
some of his poetry and his political tale of "Farmer Careful" (and his
encounters with Lord Protection etc).

The book is in Welsh.

David Widger forwards the following note about #14358, A Little Book of
Filipino Riddles:

Note from submitter: This includes material in English (main), and the
following Philippine languages (iso 639 code): Tagalog (tl), Bikol (bik),
Hiligaynon (hil), Ilokano, (ilo), Pangasinan (pag), Kapampangan (pam),
and Gaddang (no ISO 639 code, gad in SIL ethnologue). Hiligaynon is
confusingly identified as Bisayan, which can mean any of the several
languages spoken in the Visayas, and is more commonly known as Ilonggo.

Joe Loewenstein sends along the following about #14305, Brut:

Layamon was an early Middle English poet (pre-Chaucer). This work is part
of his chronicle of English history written about 1200.
