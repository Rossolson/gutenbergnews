Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
an *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

*** Continuing Requests For Assistance:

Project Gutenberg--Canada will be starting up soon.
Please let us know if you would like to volunteer!
Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,
and we have volunteers working on both of these.
We will also be seeking volunteers from others of
the "life +50" countries, as it looks as if the
Australian copyright law is falling victim to the
new "Economic Warfare" being waged by the World
Intellectual Property Organization and various
billionaire copyright holders around the world.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 13 weeks of this year, we have produced 1330 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our FIRST 1330 eBooks!!!

         That's 12 WEEKS as Compared to ~27 YEARS!!!


With 12,230 eBooks online as of April 07, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.82 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.32 when we had 7548 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 12,000 books each costing $.50 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 12,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 12,230 eBooks in 32 Years and 9.00 Months We Averaged
      373 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       31.1 Per Month
        1.02 Per Day

At 1330 eBooks Done In The 091 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
     14.6 Per Day
    102.3 Per Week
    443.3 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


>From Newsscan:

JOBS, OUTSOURCING, AND TWO KINDS OF LIES
The job market -- which is by nature dynamic --has changed throughout
history, and change remains the order of the day, as MIT economist Frank
Levy explains: "If you can describe a job precisely, or write rules for
doing it, it's unlikely to survive. Either we'll program a computer to do
it, or we'll teach a foreigner to do it. Outsourcing accelerates what
technology was already doing. Take call centers. Eight, 10 years down the
line, we could do a lot more with voice-recognition software. But with
outsourcing you can do away with those jobs now... There are two kinds of
lies that politicians tell about outsourcing. One is that we can turn it all
back. But even if you cut off all trade, technology can do the same things
to workers. The other is that education is all that matters. That's true, of
course, but only in the long run." (Wall Street Journal 2 Apr 2004)
http://tinyurl.com/2ejwu ([PAID!]sub req'd) [$80 per year???]

[And. . .in a related story. . .perhaps even MORE related than. . .hee hee!]

THE OUTSOURCING PARADOX
     A report prepared for the Information Technology Association of America
(ITAA) by Global Insight predicts that the continuing business trend of
outsourcing white-collar jobs to low wage countries will ultimately lower
inflation, create jobs and boost productivity in the U.S. Although the
researchers believe that demand for U.S. software engineers will shrink
through 2008, ITAA is emphasizing that outsourcing has damaged the job
market far less than the dot-com meltdown of early 2000, when Internet
startups, telecom companies and other companies eliminated as many as
268,000 positions. ITAA president Harris Miller says, "The myth is that
we've started this long decline into the midnight of the technology work
force. This report shows that, assuming the recovery continues, the number
of IT jobs will actually increase." (AP/Los Angeles Times 30 Mar 2004)

GOOGLE UPS THE ANTE WITH E-MAIL SERVICE
Google is launching a new e-mail service dubbed Gmail, which it says
will offer users better access to searching their e-mail as well as a large
amount of free storage capacity. The move raises the stakes with
competitors Yahoo and MSN, which have long provided e-mail services but as
a tiered product that provided only minimal storage at the free level while
charging fees to users who wanted more capacity. Google plans to support
Gmail through advertising rather than fees. (New York Times 1 Apr 2004)
http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/01/technology/01google.html

[And. . .In A Related Story. . .and See Another Related Story in Edupage]

PRIVACY ADVOCATES TARGET GOOGLE'S GMAIL STORAGE POLICY
      Privacy advocates are voicing concern over Google's data retention
plans, following the search company's splashy launch of its free Gmail
service last week. Google's Gmail privacy policy tells users: "The contents
of your Gmail account are also stored and maintained on Google servers in
order to provide the service. Indeed, residual copies of e-mail may remain
on our systems, even after you have deleted them from your mailbox or after
the termination of your account." The fact that e-mail records potentially
could be combined with Google search cookies, designed to index users'
searches through 2038, and an Orkut cookie that contains personal
identification information, is what has privacy watchdogs worried. "Once
users register for Gmail, Google would be able to make that connection, if
it chose to," says Pam Dixon, head of the World Privacy Forum. "And if
Google ever compared the two sets of data, there are some people who would
be chilled and embarrassed." Archivist Daniel Brandt adds: "While Google
brags that no humans will read your e-mails, the entire Gmail program will
involve extensive automated profiling of you as an individual. Google will
be sharing non-identifiable portions of your profile with anyone they choose.
If the ownership of Google changes, or there is a merger, the entire
personally-identifiable profile will be available to the new owners or partners."

'FLASH MOB SUPERCOMPUTER' FIZZLES
An ambitious plan to assemble an instant supercomputer by asking more
than 600 students, faculty and volunteers to converge on a University of
San Francisco gymnasium with their laptops in hand fell short of
expectations Saturday when a handful of computers refused to cooperate.
Organizers planned to load each machine with software that would enable
them to take part in a single large set of calculations, known and the
Linpack benchmark. The result was intended to be similar to massively
parallel supercomputers used by corporate researchers and scientific labs,
but the USF effort succeeded in producing only a partial result -- 180
billion mathematical operations per second -- short of the 500 billion

KAZAA OWNER WELCOMES SURVEY FINDINGS
      Sharman Networks, owner of the Kazaa peer-to-peer software, has been
quick to seize on the findings of a survey released in the U.S. on Monday
which concluded that downloading music had no effect on album sales. In a
media release issued last evening, Sharman chief executive Nicola Hemming
said "We welcome sound research into the developing peer-to-peer industry
and this study appears to have covered some interesting ground. The
findings certainly support the vision we've always held for Kazaa and
crystallizes our vision for the future of content distribution." The 2002
study was conducted jointly by researchers from Harvard Business School and
the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and used data from
file-sharing services with 1.75 million downloads being studied over 17
weeks in autumn 2002. "Consider the possibilities if the record industry
actually cooperated with companies like us instead of fighting," Ms.
Hemming said. "We've offered content providers the opportunity to work with
peer-to-peer customers for nearly two years, yet the record industry
continues its narrow-minded strategy of litigation and legislation. (The

FILE TRADERS SAFE IN CANADA
A federal court in Canada has ruled that use of P2P networks to trade
music files does not constitute a violation of Canadian copyright law.
The Canadian Recording Industry Association had sought the identities
of 29 individuals alleged to have illegally shared files over P2P
networks. Justice Konrad von Finckenstein ruled, however, that the
association did not prove that the individuals had in fact distributed
songs or authorized their illegal reproduction. Simply placing the
songs on their computers and granting P2P access to those songs to
other users on the network does not prove copyright infringement, said
von Finckenstein. An attorney for the Canadian Recording Industry
Association said the group would appeal and suggested that Canadian
laws are not keeping up with evolving technologies that allow digital
piracy on such a large scale.

SECOND JUDGE REJECTS RIAA'S GROUP LAWSUITS
Weeks after a federal judge in Philadelphia ruled that the Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA) may not discover the identities
of multiple users from a single lawsuit, a judge in Florida has reached
the same conclusion. After a court ruling that said the RIAA could not
compel ISPs to disclose the identities of alleged copyright infringers
without filing a lawsuit, the group began filing individual lawsuits
against multiple defendants who share an ISP. That tactic has now been
rejected by two federal judges, forcing the RIAA to file separate "John
Doe" lawsuits against every individual it suspects of violating
copyright law. The group can still sue alleged violators and learn
their identities from ISPs, but it must do so on an individual basis,
which will cost the group more money and take more time.

GOOGLE ENTERS THE E-MAIL FRAY
Search engine Google will launch an e-mail service, called Gmail, and
take on companies such as Microsoft and Yahoo, both of which offer
e-mail as well as search services. Yahoo and Microsoft have recently
announced efforts to try to improve their share of the search market,
currently dominated by Google. Google will start well behind Microsoft,
Yahoo, and AOL in number of subscribers; each of those three companies
has more than 30 million subscribers already. The new Gmail service
will reportedly offer users premium features, such as the ability to
store large amounts of e-mail, for free. Current e-mail offerings from
Microsoft, Yahoo, and AOL typically offer free e-mail accounts but
charge users for storage above a relatively low threshold.

More Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media

I've been researching and reporting on "Stereolithography" or 3-D
printing for about 10 years, and still have very little in the way
of press coverage of a pretty exciting computer application. . .
"printing" actual 3-D objects from your computer.  At our weekly
Geek Lunch yesterday, I was advised that ads for "printers" that
use lasers to "print" on wood, plastic, fabric, paper, glass,
leather, stone, ceramic rubber, etc., have been listed and
advertized in some of the PC magazines since I left on my
speaking tour around four months ago.  One of the cutest
applications I noticed was the making of "popup books" in
which the laser actually cuts the pages so when it sits at
a right angle, something as complex as an architectural
"concept building" can appear in a nice 3-D rendering.
I'm not sure yet if there might not be more work entailed
to make sure the paper/cardboard folded properly.
Any additional information on ANY 3-D printers???

[So. . .Why Can't *WE* Put RFID Tags On Our OWN Things for 20 Cents???]

RFID TECHNOLOGY FOR AIRPORT BAGGAGE-TRACKING
Jacksonville International will be one of the first airports to track
luggage with RFID tags to increase security and help reduce the number of
lost bags. RFID stands for "radio frequency identification" systems, which
use electronic readers to record data stored within microchips encased in
plastic tags laced with metal bands that transmit signals to monitoring
devices. However, the cost of a disposable RFID chip begins at about 20
cents, which is 20 times what it costs to produce bar-code tags.

TSA EYES RFID BOARDING PASSES
The Transportation Security Administration is looking into the
possibility of using RFID-tagged airline boarding passes that would enable
passenger tracking in airports -- a proposal that has raised the hackles of
some privacy advocates. TSA says it would use the special boarding passes
in conjunction with its "registered traveler" program, which would permit
frequent fliers to provide detailed personal information, corroborated by a
background check. The RFID passes would allow these registered travelers to
speed through "special lanes" during the boarding process. The TSA has
already started work to deploy RFID boarding passes in some countries in
Africa under the Federal Aviation Administration's Safe Skies for Africa
Initiative. But Katherine Albrecht, who worked against the use of RFID tags
on retail goods, says this new proposal is a "nightmare scenario," which
uses technology to invade people's privacy. "Are they going to track how
long I spend in the ladies room?" she asks. (Computerworld 1 Apr 2004)

WHO KILLED THE NEW YORK TIMES?
Some newspaper-watchers say that deposed executive editor Howell Raines
seriously damaged the stature and credibility of the New York Times because
of the way he managed the newsroom and the news; others give the blame to
Jayson Blair, a Raines protigi who flagrantly plagiarized stories from other
newspapers and committed other editorial sins as well. Decide for yourself.
Raines justifies his own actions in a very long apologia called "My Times"
in the May issue of the Atlantic Monthly; for Blair's version of events, see
his recent book "Burning Down My Master's House: My Life at the New York
Times." Unsurprisingly, both versions of the story are distinctly
self-serving accounts of what actually happened. (Atlantic Monthly May 2004)
