There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, eg.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

We are in the process of rewriting some of the general FAQs and
would appreciate help proofreading them over the next few months.

We've added some new FAQs and generally updated information
about Project Gutenberg.  Take a look, and email Michael or
Greg with any suggestions or corrections.  We'll have these
updated from time to time, now that we've passed #10,000.
A new set of these will be in the works when we pass #20,000.

So far we have sent out 14 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

<cannona@fireantproductions.com>

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 47 weeks of this year, we have produced 3664 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3664 eBooks!!!

          That's 47 WEEKS as Compared to ~31.5 YEARS!!!


With 14,571 eBooks online as of December 01, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.69 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $.95 when we had 10,069 eBooks a year ago

Can you imagine ~14,571 books each costing ~$.26 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~14,571 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 14,571 eBooks in 33 Years and 04.75 Months We Averaged
       436 Per Year   [We do about 3/4 that much per month these days!]
        36.1 Per Month
         1.19 Per Day

At 3664 eBooks Done In The 336 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11 Per Day
      78 Per Week
     341 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.


                            *Flashback!!!

                   3334 New eBooks So Far in 2004

               It took us ~31 years for the first 3324 !

       That's the 9.75 months of 2004 as Compared to ~31 years!!!

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


>From NewsScan:


THE IPOD HALO EFFECT

[Not to mention that people are reading eBooks on the iPods!]

The popularity of Apple's iPod music players is having an unexpected
effect -- six percent of iPod users report having dumped their old PCs for
Apple Macs, and an additional 7% say they're planning to do the same. Among
the reasons cited are ease of use, a focus on entertainment and the
perception of better security. Gene Munster, senior research analyst at
Piper Jaffray, which conducted the study, says the iPod halo effect will
boost Apple's bottom line for a while to come: "We're in the very early
innings of a multiyear trend." However, to maintain the buzz, Apple will
need to stay ahead of the pack with new design trends. "They've got to keep
that 'cool factor' going. If they don't, they're in trouble," says Munster.

PC MAKERS FACING HARD TIMES

[And we wondered why Intel was withholding the 4Ghz Pentium a year ago.]

Three of the top 10 PC makers may drop out of the global PC market by
2007, starved by stagnant demand during the 2006-2008 timeframe, according
to a new report by Gartner. The near-term forecast is a little brighter --
Gartner predicts annual shipment increases of 11.3% and annual revenue
increases of about 4.7% between 2003 and 2005. But by 2006, most
corporations and consumers will have replaced their oldest computers,
completing the latest PC replacement cycle, which occurs about every four
years for PCs and every three years for laptops. Emerging markets such as
China will boost revenues during that time, but not enough to offset slack
demand elsewhere, says Gartner, which declined to say which companies might
drop out of the PC race. "The bottom line here is that the vendor landscape
will look very different in the next couple of years," says a Gartner
analyst, adding that there's still time for PC makers to enact cost-cutting
measures that would enable them to survive the anticipated drought.

CYBERSPACE ACTIVISM

[More below in Edupage section]

The German-based Web portal Lycos Europe is offering a screensaver
program that chokes spam servers by flooding them with junk traffic. The
company argues that what it's doing is perfectly legal, but former FCC chief
technologist David Farber comments: "You don't stop a bad thing by being bad
yourself. The idea of somebody coming and hitting you and you hitting back,
you both end up very hurt. It just aggravates an already serious problem."
And noted computer security expert Dorothy Denning, a professor of defense
analysis at the Navy Postgraduate School, points out that cyberspace
activism of the kind offered by Lycos Europe is likely to have only minimal
impact on spam because "the cost of adding extra bandwidth may be worth the
reward" that spammers get from their activities. She adds: "The interesting
question is whether or not that company [an anti-spam activist company]
might be liable under some law, and would probably be liable, certainly, at
least under a lawsuit by the spammers." (AP 30 Nov 2004)

LOWER PRICES ON THIN TVs (BUY NOW!)
A glut of liquid crystal display (LCD) flat-panel televisions will
cause prices to drop by as much as 30 percent over the course of 2005;
however, electronics retailers would just as soon not hear that kind of
talk, and Lee Simonson of Best Buy admits: "We do not want to talk about
predictions of price drops. We want people to buy now." According to a
survey by the Consumer Electronics Association, the most desired holiday
gift this season is a plasma TV, but Mike Fidler, an executive vice
president at Sony, says that LCD TV's will drop so much in price that plasma
will go away in three to five years.(AP/New York Times 29 Nov 2004)

WIRELESS IN PHILADELPHIA
Verizon has struck a deal with the city of Philadelphia to provide
wireless Internet access as a municipal service. A spokeswoman for
Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street says the two parties "reached an
understanding that protects our interests and allows us to move forward with
the Wireless Philadelphia initiative." Under the Pennsylvania legislation,
any political subdivision would have to get the permission of the local
telephone company to provide a telecommunications service for a fee,
including broadband Internet, and if the company rejects the plan it would
have to offer a similar service within 14 months.

SCREEN SAVER TO FIGHT SPAM
A new screensaver by Internet portal Lycos is designed to fight spam by
running up the costs of operating Web sites that sell goods commonly
advertised in spam e-mail. Rather than targeting the e-mails themselves
or their sources, which are often spoofed, the new tactic focuses on
the Web sites where spam directs consumers. Using blacklists--from
organizations such as Spamcop--of companies that profit from spam, the
screensaver sends repeated requests to those companies' Web sites for
information about their products. The goal, according to officials at
Lycos, is not to overload the sites to the point of failure but to
drive up the costs for companies to respond to so many hits on their
Web sites. The screensaver also has been shown to slow traffic on some
targeted sites by as much as 85 percent. The hope, according to Malte
Pollmann of Lycos Europe, is that there will be a general decline in
the amount of spam sent if the vendors who benefit from spam are forced
to pay much higher costs to maintain their Web sites. The screensaver,
which can be downloaded beginning in December, is available to all
users, regardless of whether they are registered users of Lycos.

*Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media


20 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF BHOPAL, AS MANY WERE KILLED AS IN 9/11

It would appear that the death rate from the Union Carbide plant
in Bhopal 20 years ago this week was nearly identical to the total
deaths from the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center 3 years ago.

In addition, some 11,000 people Bhopal residents were disabled by
the poison gas that was created when water mixed with pesticide.

[Since I first wrote this, further ressearch shows over 20,000 died.
Any further data would be appreciated]

Recent televised reports show that Union Carbide left behind clearly
marked poisons when they abandoned the Bhopal plant shortly after.

Apparently the Union Carbide headquarters of Danbury, Connecticut,
the major stockholder of the Bhopal Union Carbide India Limited plant,
appears to have paid a fee to the government of India, and considers
the case closed, even though thousands of Bhopal families appear to
have been ignored, and the neither the contamination from the explosion
nor from the other poisons intentionally left behind have been cleaned up,
even to this day.


*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK


REWRITING THE HISTORY OF THE 1968 CHICAGO POLICE RIOTS

"The police and demonstrators were going after each other.
The protestors were provoking the police."   Tom Brokaw 11/16/04

This seems to be quite at odds with his former commentaries,
which you can find searching "tom brokaw police chicago 1968"
in which he says he fought with his parents "we had a huge fight"
and that he thought his "parents who were FDR working class democrats"
"would be very sympathetic towards the demonstrators."

Apparently you really do get more conservative as you get older.
[1968 was Mr. Brokaw's first year of convention coverage.]

[By the way, as predicted here, it appears that both Tom Brokaw
and Dan Rather will be marching off to join the other dinosaurs
in the near future, and I predict Peter Jennings will join them.
The average age of these three passed double the median age of
the United States years ago when the median was 33 years of age.
Their average age is now around 73 years old.  Mr. Lehrer is
only just now coming up to 70.]

>From a Nina Totenberg, Washingon, November 30, 2004, NPR Report:

A representative of a Georgia school district who fired a
teacher/coach in an alleged Title IX retaliation said the
case could not have been made "more clearer."  This case,
in its entirety, is making its way to the Supreme Court.

John Wayne on "stealing" the America from its original inhabitants:

Q: "For years American Indians have played an important -- if subordinate --
role in your Westerns. Do you feel any empathy for them?"

A: "I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them,
if that's what you're asking. Our so-called stealing of this country from
them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who
needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for
themselves."

FIREFOX TAKES A BITE OUT OF IE

The percentage of Web surfers using Microsoft's Internet Explorer
browser has fallen below 90%, with many of those users switching over to
Mozilla's Firefox. According to a survey by OneStat.com, IE's market share
has dropped 5% since May to 88.9%, while Mozilla browsers -- including
Firefox -- have garnered an additional 5% in the same time period. Firefox's
goal is to capture 10% of the market by the end of 2005. OneStat compiled
the statistical comparisons from two million Internet users in 100 countries.

WHERE ARE SADDAM'S BILLIONS?

The UN has admitted that it appears Saddam Hussein conned/bilked
various UN committees out of a total of at least $21 billion.
So far there appears to be little or no trace of where he put it.

Is 'Fair Use' in Peril?

The far-reaching Intellectual Property Protection Act would deny
consumers many of the freedoms they take for granted.


By Eric Hellweg
November 19, 2004


Do you like fast-forwarding through commercials on a television
program you've recorded? How much do you like it? Enough to go to
jail if you're caught doing it? If a new copyright and
intellectual property omnibus bill sitting on Congress's desk
passes, that may be the choice you'll face.

How can this be possible? Because language that makes
fast-forwarding through commercials illegal-no doubt inserted at
the behest of lobbyists for the advertising industry-was inserted
into a bill that would allow people to fast forward past
objectionable sections of a recorded movie (and I bet you already
thought that was OK). And that's but one, albeit scary, scenario
that may come to pass if the Intellectual Property Protection Act
is enacted into law. Deliberations on this legislation will be
one of the tasks for the lame-duck Congress that commenced this week.

ANTI-EVOLUTION TEACHINGS GAIN FOOTHOLD IN U.S. SCHOOLS
from San Francisco Chronicle

Dover, Pa. -- The way they used to teach the origin of the species to high
school students in this sleepy town of 1,800 people in southern
Pennsylvania, said local school board member Angie Yingling
disapprovingly, was that "we come from chimpanzees and apes."

Not anymore.

The school board has ordered that biology teachers at Dover Area High
School make students "aware of gaps/problems" in the theory of evolution.
Their ninth-grade curriculum now must include the theory of "intelligent
design," which posits that life is so complex and elaborate that some
greater wisdom has to be behind it.
