Latin Is A Dying Language???
Latin Library (www.thelatinlibrary.com) died,
and was resurrected recently, bring attention
to the fact that we need to save these files,
find matching paper editions, and be sure the
files don't disappear.

If you would like to help with Latin eBooks,
please let me know.

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to only ONE DVD burner, on a laptop
belonging to a personal friend.  If you have a DVD burner
or plan to get one in the next 6 months, please email me,
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November while
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

We are seeking pro bono or very cheap legal assistance to pursue
Project Gutenberg trademark infringers and similar issues.  Please
email Michael Hart &lt;hart@pobox.com&gt;.

[We received 3 replies from the US, 1 from Australia, but
may need more around December 10.]

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://gutenberg.net/list.html  can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer.


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 24 weeks of this year, we have produced 1637 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our FIRST 1627 eBooks!!!

         That's 24 WEEKS as Compared to 28 YEARS!!!


With 8,367 eBooks online as of June 25, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.19 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.84 when we had 5387 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 8,000+ books each costing $.65 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 8,000+ books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 8352 eBooks in ~31 Years and 11.75 Months We Averaged
    266 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     22 Per Month
     .7 Per Day

At 1609 eBooks Done In 2003 We Averaged
      9 Per Day
     64 Per Week
    281 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

[Editor's Comments In Brackets]

From Newsscan

INSTANT MESSAGES FOREVER (OR AT LEAST THREE YEARS)
NASD, the self-regulatory body of the investment industry, is telling Wall
Street brokers that instant messages must be saved for at least three years:
"NASD recognizes that instant messaging is becoming increasingly popular as
a real-time method of communicating and we want to be clear about our
expectations for its use. Firms have to remember that regardless of the
informality of instant messaging, it is still subject to the same
requirements as e-mail communications." (Washington Post 19 Jun 2003)

[Don't It Always Seem To Go They Charge Most To Those Who Have The Least]

7-ELEVEN WANTS TO BE YOUR BANK
Convenience retailer 7-Eleven will be equipping about 3,500 of its stores
with "vcom" (for "virtual commerce") kiosks that offer check-cashing and
other financial services. The company will receive 10% of the value of
personal checks, and will require customers to register for the service.
7-Eleven executive Jay Giesen says, "During focus groups we conducted last
year, customers told us they wanted to cash their paychecks and pay their
bills at the same time. 7-Eleven created Vcom to provide customers
around-the-clock access to products and services not traditionally found in
convenient locations." Industry consultant Morris Reid says that fees range
from 5% to 25% for businesses offering check cashing services, and explains
that, by "answering a market demand," 7-Eleven will be able to "capture
lucrative fees and get people into their store where they can then up-sell
other products and services. I think you will see other non-traditional
companies, particularly retailers, make these services available."

VERIZON TO SUPPORT CELL NUMBER PORTABILITY
Verizon Wireless, which has 33.3 million subscribers, had decided to
distance itself from other wireless providers by supporting the idea that
customers should be allowed to keep their cell phone numbers when they
switch wireless carriers. Chief executive Dennis Strigl urges his peers:
"Let's as an industry stop moaning and groaning. Our government has spoken.
Our customers tell us they want it. Let's clear the decks and get it done."

SENATE TRIES AGAIN TO LEGISLATE AGAINST SPAMMERS
The Senate Commerce Committee has unanimously approved a bill that would
make it illegal for any person or company to use fraudulent or deceptive
return e-mail address, false e-mail headers, or false and misleading subject
lines. The bill, if passed into law, will also require that all e-mail
marketing messages label those messages as advertisements, provide the
sender's physical address, and offer a way for recipients to decline to
receive any further messages from the marketer who sent them. (New York

[They Used To Say The Same Thing About Interferce With Medical Equipment]

DO CELL PHONES FLY WELL?
The Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Transport Association have
commissioned a new study to determine whether cell phones and other wireless
communications devices on commercial flights do or do not interfere with
navigational equipment. The head of the organization that will be doing the
study says, "There's potential of interference from these devices, but no
one has ever been able to corroborate that when you turn the electronic
gizmo on, it will cause an airplane failure." (Washington Post 20 Jun 2003)

[Another Digital Divide Benefit?!?!?!?!]

E-FILERS MAY GET EXTRA TWO WEEKS NEXT YEAR
To encourage tax payers to save the government money by filing their taxes

electronically. The Senate will have to pass a similar bill if the measure
is to become law. (AP/Los Angeles Times 20 Jun 2003)

APPLE'S SUCCESS CONVINCES OTHERS
The success of Apple Computer's iTunes music service has encouraged
several other high-profile companies to offer similar services or to
modify existing services in the manner of iTunes. Companies including
Amazon.com, Microsoft, America Online (AOL), and RealNetworks have
apparently taken notice of the success of iTunes, which reportedly sold
three million songs for 99 cents each during the first month of the
service. Observers said that Apple's example demonstrates that a good
selection and a simple process can entice consumers away from illegal
file trading. iTunes offers 200,000 tracks by popular artists, allows
users to copy them as many times as they want, and gives buyers the
ability to make one-click purchases subsequent to entering customer
identification and credit card information. Amazon.com, which formerly
refused to consider selling individual songs, is now pursuing such a
strategy after iTunes showed that consumers will still buy whole CDs.
AOL Music, which does not directly sell downloadable music, will begin
doing just that by the end of the year. RealNetworks has already
modified its online music service and offered songs at 79 cents each, a
direct response to the success of iTunes.
