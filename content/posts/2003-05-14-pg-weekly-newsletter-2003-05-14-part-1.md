DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

We need a volunteer near Chicago to help feed books to our newest
super-scanner. . .we have a stack of 200 waiting, and just cannot
stay away to feed them in 24/7.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Las Vegas, NV 89117


We will also have this
new address in Chicago!

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

From: Miranda van de Heijning &lt;m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com&gt;
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

Statistical Review

In the 19 weeks of this year, we have produced 1174 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our FIRST 1174 eBooks!!!

         That's 19 WEEKS as Compared to 27 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 7,916 eBooks online as of May 14, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.26 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.92 when we had 5219 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing $.66 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 7916 eBooks in ~31 3/4 Years We Averaged
    249 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     21 Per Month
     .7 Per Day

At 1173 eBooks Done In 2003 We Averaged

***Headline News***

From Newsscan

"An idealist is a person who helps other people to be prosperous."
Henry Ford

"There's no reason to burn books if you don't read them.
The education system in this country is just terrible,
and we're not doing anything about it." (Ray Bradbury)


ALL EYES ON iTUNES
The success of Apple's newly launched iTunes Music Store has drawn the
attention of potential rivals, who will go head-to-head with the popular
service when Apple extends it to Microsoft-based PCs at the end of this
year. Among the contenders are pressplay and MusicNet, backed by the major
record labels; Listen.com's Rhapsody; Musicmatch; FullAudio; and Echo, a
music venture backed by Best Buy, Borders Group, Virgin Entertainment Group
and others. In addition, AOL plans to introduce a pay-per-download service
late this year and Amazon and MSN also are exploring the possibility.
"Everyone in the music industry, and the film industry, and others, are
looking at Apple and saying, 'Oh my God,'" says Warner Music Group
executive VP Paul Vidich. "There's no question it has sparked new
interest." Part of the allure of Apple's iTunes is the flexible
arrangements CEO Steve Jobs negotiated with the record labels, which enable
users to move their 99-cent songs to an unlimited number of portable iPod
players, and burn as many as 10 identical CDs containing the same playlist.
It's anticipated that many of the competing services will try to duplicate
this flexibility, although Apple concedes it will be difficult to match the
simplicity and elegance it's achieved with its own hardware and operating
system. Meanwhile, several potential online-music players are staying on
the sidelines for now. "Apple's success in the Mac environment hasn't yet
proven that this is a real business with decent margins," says Yahoo VP
Dave Goldberg. "If it is, a lot of major players will get into the space."

SWAPPERS BOOST MUSIC SALES
A Nielsen/NetRatings survey of 36,000 Internet users found that Web surfers
who download music from song-swapping sites are more likely to buy music
online and in stores, than non-swappers. The research indicates that in the
past three months, online music enthusiasts (defined as people who'd
downloaded music in the past 30 days) were 111% more likely to buy rap
music than the average Internet user. They were also 106% more likely to
have purchased dance and club music and 77% more likely to have bought
alternative rock than their average online counterparts. R&B, soul music
and rock rounded out the top five genres favored by music fans. Greg Bloom,
a senior analyst at Nielsen/NetRatings, says that understanding the
preferences of online music enthusiasts may help recording executives in
their attempts to promote their own, legitimate services: "The de facto
standard may be a few years away, but understanding the genres of music
that sell well online and offline will be crucial to generating revenue
along the way." (Reuters/CNet News.com 7 May 2003)

TIVO LICENSES ITS TECHNOLOGY FOR DVD PLAYERS
TiVo, maker of set-top devices that enable television viewers to pause and
replay live shows, is licensing a bare-bones version of its service to
makers of DVD players. The TiVo Basic service will be free, and will allow
buyers of the enhanced DVDs to pause live TV shows and record programs
selected by time and date, but will not include TiVo's more advanced
features, such as the ability to save every Atlanta Braves game played
during a set period. However, buyers will be able to upgrade to TiVo's full
service for about $13 a month or a one-time fee of $299. Toshiba will be
the first company to produce a DVD player equipped with TiVo Basic service,
which will be available in retail stores later this year. (Reuters 8 May 2003)

EARTHLINK AWARDED $16M IN SPAMAGES
A federal judge awarded Earthlink $16.4 million in damages and instituted a
permanent injunction against a Buffalo, NY, man identified as the
ringleader of a group that used Earthlink's network to send 825 million
spam messages over the past year. Earthlink said Howard Carmack and his
cronies used Internet accounts opened with stolen identities and credit
cards to send junk e-mail. The ruling is the latest in a series of legal
actions taken by ISPs against bulk spammers. Last year Earthlink won $25
million in damages in a suit against another bulk e-mailer, Kahn C. Smith
of Tennessee, but it hasn't collected the award. The company also has
several other lawsuits pending. Meanwhile, last December, America Online
won a $6.9 million judgment against a now-defunct Illinois company that
specialized in p*rnographic spam. Over the last few years, AOL has won 25
spam-related lawsuits against more than 100 companies and individuals, says
a company spokesman. (AP 7 May 2003)

[This Is The Same Process That Elminated Telephone Operators, hee hee!]

ACTORS WITH ZERO-AND-ONE TALENTS
In the new movie "The Matrix Reloaded," scenes were created by
photographing real people and then manipulating them digitally. Producer
Joel Silver says: "This is going to change the way people make movies. It's
not 'Shrek' or 'Toy Story.' You're seeing reality-based scenes dealing with
human characters, and it's designed so you really can't distinguish between
the real actor and the ones and zeros. And you're talking about shots that
are close-ups on faces, and emotion coming through. There are some really
remarkable scenes that the audience will never know were constructed in a
computer, or that there's nobody actually in it."

TV-SHOW SWAPPING CATCHES HOLLYWOOD BY SURPRISE
The proliferation in European broadband Internet access is fueling a new
trend -- TV-show swapping -- which enables European viewers to catch the
latest U.S. sitcoms just days after they first air, rather than waiting
months for a local network to broadcast them. Jacqueline Hurt, a lawyer
specializing in media law, says, "Until now, the effect of the Internet on
TV and film has been small because of the speed issues involved in
downloading. But with the increased uptake of broadband, and if the quality
was acceptable, then this could be a big issue for broadcasters and
program-makers^E The value of a program to broadcasters will go down if the
program is readily available on the Internet." But broadcasters remain
largely unaware of the threat. Yinka Adegoke, deputy editor of New Media
Age magazine, says: "No one I know in the industry is aware of it and it is
just not on the agenda^E If this goes from being a niche activity to the
mainstream it will be virtually impossible to stop. This is exactly what
happened to the music industry. Once the genie is out of the bottle you

INTERNET TOILET A HOAX
The iLoo, described in a press release last week as a portable toilet with
wireless keyboard and an extending height-adjustable plasma screen in front
of the seat, doesn't exist: it was just a joke. Microsoft says the hoax
press release came from the company's MSN division in the U.K. and was not
a "Microsoft-sanctioned communication." It all just goes to show that you
can't believe what you read anymore, not even the toilet jokes.

SONY TOUTS 'THE WALKMAN OF THE 21ST CENTURY'
Sony announced its latest salvo in the videogame wars: a small, lightweight
videogame device called PlayStation Portable (PSP for short), which will
hit the shelves toward the end of 2004 and will feature a 4.5-inch screen
and a high-end processor for running games. The PSP will be capable of
linking by wire to other PSPs, cell phones, PCs and Sony's PlayStation 2.
Sony Computer Entertainment president Ken Kutaragi says the PSP will be
"the Walkman of the 21st century."

ALTERNATIVES TO MICROSOFT ARE GETTING WORLDWIDE ATTENTION
In a new report called "A Look at Alternatives to Microsoft," the Gartner
research firm says that governments throughout the world are encouraging
departments and businesses to consider alternatives to support Linux, an
increasingly popular alternative to Microsoft's Windows operating system.
This development is taking place in China, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia,
Australia, and several European and South American countries. Gartner says
the attractiveness of Linux seems to be attributable to widespread
perceptions that Microsoft insists on unattractive licensing arrangements
and offers inadequate software protections against security breaches.

SOUTH KOREA'S 'CITIZEN REPORTERS'
The increasingly popular South Korean online news site ohmynews.com has
more than 26,300 of its readers registered as "citizen reporters" who
account for about 80% of the site news coverage (the rest of which is
written by ohmynews's 38 professional writers and editors). The mainstream
press is critical of ohmynews's journalistic methods, but senior editor and
founder Oh Yeon-ho says that his intention is to "say goodbye to 20th
century journalism," by showing that every citizen can be a reporter. "We
put everything out there and people judge the truth for themselves."

MICROSOFT TOILET PROJECT WASN'T HOAX
Microsoft and its public relations firm are now saying that what they
themselves thought was a hoax (the development of the iLoo, a portable
toilet complete with wireless keyboard and Internet access) actually was a
real project of the company's MSN group in the UK. The original press
release indicated that the iLoo would offer its users "a unique
experience." An MSN product manager now says: " "We jumped the gun
basically yesterday in confirming that it was a hoax and in fact it was
not," said Lisa Gurry, MSN group product manager. "Definitely we're going
to be taking a good look at our communication processes internally. It's
definitely not how we like to do PR at Microsoft." In any event, whether
really a hoax or really real, the project is now dead -- flushed, as it were.

[White Collar Crime. . .What If This Were Just Plain Robbery???]
SEC FILES FRAUD CHARGES
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against K.
C. Smith in a U.S. District Court in Tennessee. Mr. Smith, a
20-year-old Kentucky resident, was charged with raising $102,554
through two fake Web sites and millions of spam e-mail messages between
May 2002 and February 2003. SEC regulators allege that Mr. Smith's Web
site for a fake company, Kryer Financial, offered double-digit monthly
returns. Mr. Smith also invented the United States Deposit Insurance
Corporation to insure Kryer Financial investments against loss, with a
Web site that featured the SEC's official seal. Mr. Smith allegedly
used the money he collected for living expenses and neither invested
nor insured it. Mr. Smith agreed to a settlement that requires him to
return $107,510 of gains and interest.

INTEL DISCLOSES FLAW IN ITANIUM 2
Intel recently announced that an electrical problem can cause computers
that use its Itanium 2 processor to behave strangely or crash. While
the problem affects only some chips and can be circumvented by setting
the processor to run at a lower speed, Intel will replace the processor
at customers' request. According to analysts, the problem is uncommon
because the machines have been on the market for a year and only
recently have problems surfaced. The Itanium line was designed to
handle chips from Sun Microsystems and IBM to be used in high-end
servers with dozens of processors. The problem has created a ripple
effect through the computer industry, with IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and
Dell addressing the issue in different ways. Sales of Itanium 2 servers
are expected to suffer because the more powerful Itanium 2 6M
processor, soon to be released, is unaffected by the glitch.

GOP SENATORS DROP EFFORT TO EXTEND PATRIOT ACT
In a highly negotiated deal this week, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch withdrew a
proposal to make the expanded law-enforcement powers of the USA Patriot
Act permanent. Civil liberties groups, many Democrats, and a few
Republicans strongly opposed extending the surveillance powers, which
are scheduled to expire in 2005. Timothy Edgar of the American Civil
Liberties Union called the withdrawal a "major victory" and suggested
that many believe that "the government has already gone too far with
the Patriot Act." As part of the compromise not to extend the Patriot
Act, the Senate voted 90 to 4 supporting a bill that gives government
officials broader authority to obtain warrants for surveillance. Some
argue that such authority could have prevented the September 11
attacks. The Senate bill now moves to the House, where the level of
support is uncertain.

FISA WIRETAPS JUMP 30 PERCENT
Privacy advocates and civil liberties groups report that the FBI
increasingly submits wiretap requests to the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court, which was created in 1978 by the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), rather than to state and federal
courts. Warrants granted under FISA give broader authority for searches
than Title III wiretaps, granted by the courts, and receive less
scrutiny. Despite a report last year that the FBI had misled FISA on 75
occasions, FISA has never rejected a wiretap request. Last year the
number of wiretap applications to FISA jumped 30 percent, from 934 to
1,228, while the number of wiretaps approved by state and federal
judges dropped from 1,491 to 1,359. Critics of the system point out
that the FISA court meets privately and all records from the court's
proceedings are sealed, even to those prosecuted by FISA orders. Beryl
Howell, who served as general counsel for the Senate judiciary
committee from 1993 to 2003, said, "When it comes to FISA, there are
virtually no reporting requirements."

SPAMMER FINED, BARRED FROM SENDING UNSOLICITED E-MAIL
Internet service provider EarthLink has won a lawsuit against Howard
Carmack for sending as many as 825 million spam e-mails to EarthLink
subscribers. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas W. Thrash Jr. ruled that
Carmack must pay EarthLink $16.4 million and is permanently prohibited
from sending, or helping anyone else send, unwanted e-mail. Carmack
allegedly used stolen credit cards, identity theft, and banking fraud
to set up e-mail accounts to send spam and help others send spam.
Neither Carmack nor an attorney representing him appeared in court.
Last year EarthLink won damages of $25 million in a case against
another spammer, though the company said it has not collected that
money. An attorney for EarthLink said the injunction against Carmack is
much more significant than the damages.
