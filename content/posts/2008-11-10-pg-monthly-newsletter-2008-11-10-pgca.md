<pre>Here's the news from PG Canada for October.

We published a total of 13 ebooks during the month: we have now published a
cumulative total of 190 ebooks.

The New Releases section at the top of the PGC main page always gives the
details of new releases for the most recent three months.

LANGUAGES:
- 7 titles were in English
- 5 were in French
- 1 was in German: our first title in that language!

GENRES
- 4 were history books and monographs
- 3 were novels
- 3 were books for children
- 2 were biographical monographs
- 1 was a book of essays

Eight of this month's ebooks were by Canadians.

Seven of this month's titles were nonfiction: a majority of the ebooks
published.  This is a very gratifying result: we want to ensure that there is
a place of honour in the PGC catalogue for non-fiction.  Ebooks on science,
philosophy, and economics are currently underway.

Authors and illustrators new to PGC this month included:

Stockton, Frank Richard (1834-1902) [American author] Sulte, Benjamin (1841-
1923) [Historien canadien]
