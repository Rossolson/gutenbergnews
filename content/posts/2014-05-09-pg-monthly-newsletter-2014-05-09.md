This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for April-May 2014.

CONTENTS

* Editorial content

* David Price's "In Progress" list has moved
* "Thank you" message received
* New eBook listings from March & April 2014


* Editorial content

I have not had too many submissions of items for this and last month's
newsletter, so have combined April & May.  If you have items of note,
please share them.  Brief announcements, requests for assistance, and
other items related to Project Gutenberg are welcome.


* Bookshelves undergoing revitalization

Thanks to several volunteers, there have been a series of updates and
improvements to the Project Gutenberg bookshelf area.  This is where
eBooks are hand-selected for inclusion in various areas related to
topic, genre, audience, or other themes.  Here is the main launchpoint
for bookshelves:

  www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Category:Bookshelf

Updating bookshelves is an ongoing process, and as with most volunteer
activities at Project Gutenberg there is no particular timeline or
anticipated completion date.  Instead, different sections are being
updated by people who have interests in those sections.  Suggestions
are always welcome, and may be sent to the Cataloging Team - see the
"contact us" section at www.gutenberg.org


* David Price's "In Progress" list has moved

David Price's In Progress list has moved to a new location:

  www.pglaf.org/~ccx074/gutip.html

This is where people seeking to prepare new eBooks for Project
Gutenberg can first check whether someone else has already been
working on that item.  For more on the Project Gutenberg procedures on
new eBooks, please view this page:

  www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Public_Domain_eBook_Submission_How-To


* "Thank you" message received

We are sharing this note we recently received:

"Dear beloved Project Gutenberg-Makers,

I wanted to thank you all for your effort and passion to do a such
great page like this.  Information in all forms should be free!  And you
all are a great big step to that reality!  Keep going and wish you all
the best and a wonderful week   :-)

Keep on going and stand true for your principles!

Love,
Lisa-Marie"
