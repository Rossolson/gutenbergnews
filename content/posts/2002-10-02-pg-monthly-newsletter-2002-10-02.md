*The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter For Wednesday, October 2, 2002*
**eBooks Easily Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Over 31 Years**

       Last Week We Published Our 6,000th Project Gutenberg eBook!


                 A quote from last year's Newsletter:


"Project Gutenberg's Monthly Newsletter for Wednesday, October 3, 2001

11 months ago we posted our 3,000th Etext, with 100-200 reserved.
Today, we posted our 4,000th text, with only about 64 slots reserved."

        Now On The Way To Our 7,000th Project Gutenberg eBook!!!


Gutenberg History:  450 Years Ago The First Portion Of The Gutenberg Bible
Started To Come Off The Press:  Starting On September 30, 1452.  Gutenberg
Presses Used Moveable Pieces Of Type, Rather Than One Plate Per Page, From
Which Came Interchangeable Parts, The Staple Of The Industrial Revolution.

The Industrial Revolution created the strong middle classes upon which the
democracies of today were founded.  We hope Project Gutenberg provides the
examples necessary for the Neo-Industrial Revolution, which will once more
create such strong middle classes around the world.

  This Newsletter also marks the appearance of the first file published
  from the output of our new SuperScanner!!!  More about that next week.

This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free

write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the first 39 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,774 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our *FIRST* 1,774 eBooks!!!

             That's 39 WEEKS as Compared to 28 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 6,066 eTexts online as of October 2, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.65 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.53 when we had 3896 Etexts A Year Ago
