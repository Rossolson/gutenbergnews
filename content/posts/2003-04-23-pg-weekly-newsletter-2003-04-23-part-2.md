2) A small feature on Shakespeare

English poet, dramatist, and actor, considered by many to be the greatest dramatist of all time. Shakespeare became the first  to appeal and to meet with the full approval of a broad and mixed public embracing almost all levels of society. He possessed a large vocabulary for his day, having used 29,066 different words in his plays. Today the average English-speaking person uses something like 2,000 words in everyday speech.

William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. He was the eldest son of Mary Arden, the daughter of a local landowner, and her husband John Shakespeare (c. 1530-1601), a glover and wood dealer. In 1568 John Shakespeare was made a mayor of Stratford and a justice of peace. His wool business failed in the 1570s, but the family's position was restored in the 1590s by earnings of William Shakespeare, and in 1596 he was awarded a coat of arms.

Shakespeare is assumed to have been educated at Stratford Grammar School, and he may have spent the years 1580-82 as a teacher for the Roman Catholic Houghton family in Lancashire. At the age of 18, he married a local girl, Anne Hathaway (died 1623), who was eight years older. Their first child, Susannah, was born within six months, and twins Hamnet and Judith were born in 1585. Hamnet, Shakespeare's only son, died in 1896, at the age of 11.

According to a legend, he left Stratford for London to avoid a charge of poaching. After 1582 Shakespeare probably joined as an actor one or several companies of players. By 1584 he emerged as a rising playwright in London, and became soon a central figure in London's leading theatre company, the Lord Chamberlain's Company, renamed later as the King's Men.

Shakespeare was known in his day as a very rapid writer, his publishers Heminges and Condell reported, "and what he thought, he uttered with that easiness that we have scarce received from him a blot in his papers." Despite all the praise, some writer's were not enthusiastic about his plays. Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) called A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM "the most insipid, ridiculous play that I ever saw in my life."

About 1610 Shakespeare returned to his birthplace and lived as a country gentleman. A number of his plays were published during his lifetime, but none of the original dramatic manuscripts have survived. Shakespeare died on April 23, 1616.

On Shakespeare's gravestone are four lines of verse.

Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbeare

To digg the dust enclosed here!

Blest be ye man that spares thes stones

And curst be he that moues my bones.
                    -------------------

From: Tonya Allen

My favorite plays, in approximate order: The Tempest; Hamlet; Julius Caesar;
Macbeth; The Merchant of Venice. But one of my favorite speeches comes from
Antony and Cleopatra (Cleopatra's speech upon the death of Antony):

  Noblest of men, woo't die?
  Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
  In this dull world, which in thy absence is
  No better than a sty?--O, see, my women,

  [Antony dies.]

  The crown o' the earth doth melt.--My lord!--
  O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
  The soldier's pole is fallen: young boys and girls
  Are level now with men: the odds is gone,
  And there is nothing left remarkable
  Beneath the visiting moon.

  --Antony and Cleopatra, Act IV, SCENE XV
