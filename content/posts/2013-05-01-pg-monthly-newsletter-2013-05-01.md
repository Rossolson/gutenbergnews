* Copyright Threat in Canada

Via Mark Akrigg, of www.gutenberg.ca:

The long debate over the Copyright Act revisions in Canada is over, and the
changes are now in force.  Some of the changes are good, others are not.
But from my perspective the main thing is that Life+50 has been preserved.
And it has become very clear that the Canadian public is extremely aware of
copyright issues, and that, in the absence of outside factors, Life+50 will
endure.

But there *are* outside factors.  Talks are underway for the Trans Pacific
Partnership, a "trade agreement" involving a dozen or so countries, including
Canada, Mexico, and the U.S.  It includes an unsavoury set of proposals,
including copyright extensions to Life+70.

If these extensions went through, 20 years of the pubic domain would disappear
in Canada and New Zealand, and it would become that much harder for Congress
to roll back the unfortunate 1998 copyright extensions, because of
"international obligations".

It is difficult to exaggerate the danger posed by these secret negotiations.
Senator Wyden of Oregon has stated that "the majority of Congress is being
kept in the dark as to the substance of the TPP negotiations, while
representatives of U.S. corporations ??? like Halliburton, Chevron, PHRMA,
Comcast, and the Motion Picture Association of America ??? are being
consulted and made privy to details of the agreement":

There is awareness in Canada of the risks posed by the TPP.  I personally
became very active very early, and did everything I could to alert the
Canadian public to what was going on.  I was surprised and gratified by the
strong positive reaction that I received.

In New Zealand, there is widespread opposition to the TPP's attack on the
public domain:

http://blog.greens.org.nz/2012/01/24/trans-pacific-partnership-to-impact-kiwi-books/
(The author of this blog item is a Member of Parliament in New Zealand)

But the attack on the public domain originated in the United States, and
strong public opposition within the U.S. would be the most effective way of
stopping this attack.

The American Library Association and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have
already spoken publicly about the TPP, but my sense is that the American
public is not aware of what is going on.

I'd be very happy to learn that PG US and its friends are actively working to
stop the TPP.

P.S. As part of my activity, in August 2012 I made a formal submission to the
U.S. government explaining why the TPP is harmful to the citizens of the
United States as well as of other countries:

www.gutenberg.ca/documents/tpp-bad-deal-mark-akrigg-120827.html

It was not a time to mince words, and my language was direct.  I explained
why the Trans Pacific Partnership is particularly harmful to Americans, and
how it attacks the American Constitution and the principles of American
democracy.  I also gave the background to the American copyright extensions
of recent years.
