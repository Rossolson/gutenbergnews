Blackstone's Commentaries Request

Is this doable?  I just got the first of four volumes (I'm not sure when
I'll be able to afford the other three -- they're about $16 each) of the
paperback facsimile edition the University of Chicago Press put out in 1979.
The facsimile title page says it was published in Oxford in M.DCC.LXV.  It
has "s"s that look like "f"s, footnotes all over the place, and lots of
French and Latin phrases scattered thru it, all in Italics.  Each volume is
about 500 pp.  So I ask again, is this doable?

From: "K. Kay Shearin" &lt;poach@ezol.com&gt;

It's William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England: A Facsimile of
the First Edition of 1765-1769, from The University of Chicago Press,
copyright 1979.

There's a hardbound edition, too, but in paperback the ISBNs are:

Vol. 1:  0-226-05538-8 (this is the one I have)
Vol. 2:  0-226-05541-8
Vol. 3:  0-226-05543-4
Vol. 4:  0-226-05545-0

The intro says it's "the most important legal treatise ever written in the
English language," and this "edition is meant to make the book available to
students and scholars in an accurate, accessible, and inexpensive form," so
it really does belong on Gutenberg, so I don't feel guilty about pulling
strings to get it there.  (Of course, I can't remember the last time I did
something on purpose that I did feel guilty about.)

From: "Oliver.C.Colt. " &lt;colt@guernsey.net&gt;

Dear Professor Hart.   Some time ago I sent you a transcript of a tale
written by Tolstoy and translated by Aylmer Maude, the title being "A
prisoner in the Caucuses".  There was some uncertainty about the
copyright position, as the book from which I had taken this was
published in the U.K. in 1931.  However, I find that this translation and
others by Aylmer Maude were being published long before that in a
variety of publications.  It occurs to me that if the matter is investigated
it might well be that the story could be used in P.G. without infringing
any copyright. May I suggest that if you are interested you set your
bloodhounds on the trail,  unless you feel quite sure that a search would
be pointless.

From:  Sandra Laythorpe. slaythorpe@cwcom.net
Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823-1901) lived in the village of Otterbourne,
Hampshire, England, all her life. She was a friend of John Keble, founder of
The Oxford Movement, and would have known Florence Nightingale, who was a
near neighbour, and other notables.  She was a very popular novelist, but
her books are little read nowadays, because they are considered by modern
critics to be sentimental and narrow.  Her most popular work is 'The Heir of
Redclyffe' (1853), which has recently been reprinted.  Miss Yonge was a
woman of her time, and records the lives of families living through the
great social changes of the 19th Century.  I think her works are ideal for
the Gutenberg Project, because they are important social records, have been
neglected for nearly 100 years, and they deserve to have a wider reading
audience.  My personal interest began because I live about 2 miles from her
house, she was a well known local benefractress.  I have enjoyed her books
very much, and I think her insights into human nature and spirituality are
quite amazing.  I intend to start with her most popular works, I believe she
wrote about 160 novels.  Most of her work is available in Hampshire County
Library, so they are easily accessible to me.  ***get more***

Time to run the copyright rules by them again, and also have had a couple
of complaints about the how-to input directions being wordy. I thought I
re-wrote them, but that's not what's at the site. Remind me again when the

A PROPOSAL FOR PUBLISHING PROJECT GUTENBERG BOOKS IN HTML

by philip Hunt &lt;phil@comuno.com&gt;

There is a problem in that PG books are currently on the web
site in ascii, but the prefered format for web-basded information
is HTML. One solution would be to copy all the books into HTML.
However, this would present other problems, such as:

(1) what about other data formats such as WAP, RTF, DocBook,
MSWord, PDF, etc? Will we want to transcribe all existing PG
books into these formats as well?

(2) what about new PG books? We don't want to have to manually
enter the same book multiple times, once for each format.

(3) HTML is popular now, but will it be in 10 years time? Will
something else be popular then? We don't want to have to keep
re-translating.

These problems can be solved by translating them not into HTML,
but into an XML-based format.

I envisage that most of ther work in translation can be done
programmatically -- I plan writing a few experimental Python scripts
to do this over the next few weeks.

Of course, it is necessary to define exactly what the XML-based format
will look like (i.e. what tags to use, and their meaning). My preference
would be for something quite simple: &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt; to define
types of paragraph, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; to define italic and boldface, and
&lt;pre&gt; to define preformated text. As you probably know, these are the same
tags that HTML uses.

Once the data is in the XML format, translating to the other formats I
mentioned above will be easy, i.e. it will be able to be done entirely
automatically once the right programs are written. I do not envisage these
programs as being difficult to write. So once a book is in XML, it is
(almost) automatically available in all the other formats that we will
support. And if PG decides to use a new format, it is just a matter of
writing a smallish translation program, and hey presto all the existing
books are converted.

New PG books would be typed in in the XML format (another reason for
making it as simple as possible).


PERSONAL NOTES

I've got the programming skills to do the code-writing part of the
project, and I have a web server that I can host 500MB of data on.
The thing I would probably need most help on is manually formatting text
into XML (as I said, I hope most of this process can be automated).

RACING TO CONVERT BOOKS TO BYTES
Although skepticism remains as to whether readers will embrace
digital books, interest in the electronic format is growing, with
young people leading the trend.  The University of Texas at
Austin plans to spend $1 million to increase its current
collection of 6,000 electronic books.  Students are checking out
the university's digital books at astonishing rates, says
librarian Dennis Dillon.  "Usually a book has a one-third chance
of being checked out," Dillon says.  "So to have some title
checked out 25 times in two months--that's shocking."  Companies
such as Microsoft are preparing for a wave of digital reading,
predicting that electronic books will overtake print books within
10 years.  Meanwhile, traditional publishers such as Random House
are skeptical about the new format but are still moving to
digitize all of their titles.  Startups such as netLibrary, which
sells electronic books to libraries, are working to draw readers
by offering a large selection of titles.  However, in order to
get publishers to sell titles, these companies need to prove that
sufficient demand exists for the digital format. (New York Times 12/09/99)

AMAZON NAME DISPUTE SETTLED
Internet retailer Amazon.com and the Amazon Bookstore, a small feminist
bookstore in Minneapolis that has used the name "Amazon" since 1970, have
settled a legal dispute over the use of their common name. The Minneapolis
store will always refer to itself by its full name of Amazon Bookstore
Cooperative and will assign its common-law rights to the name to Amazon.com
in return for a license from the Internet company to continue using the
Amazon name. (AP/USA Today 4 Nov 99)

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]



Thanks!

Happy Holidays!


You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

Remember, sometimes Dr. Internet and Project Gutenberg share lists
for mailing. . .so you may sub or unsub to both without knowing.

There are now three Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers are two
of them, and the third is for announcments for the general public.
Those of you who want the highest "signal to noise ratio, i.e. the
fewest number of messages containing the most information may want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" lists; just
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]--
In addition we have opened an "unmoderated list" called "gutvol-d"
to which anyone may subscribe and post messages. . .we may have to
limit subscriptions to actual volunteers if we start getting spam,
but for now this will be a wide open list.

Rememmber:
"gutnberg" = General Public Announcements
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements
"gutvol-d" = Free For All Discussion

To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-l Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-d Your True Name
So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
