From: hart at pglaf.org (Michael Hart)
Date: Thu Sep 22 08:27:22 2005
Subject: [gweekly] Next Newsletter
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.60.0509220825120.17972@pglaf.org&gt;


Disks and controllers on four Prairienet servers are being upgraded.
These servers will be unavailable at various times next Wednesday,
September 28th from 8am until work is completed.

Thus I am currently planning to post the Newsletter a day early
or a day late, either on Tuesday or Thursday, but I may try to
get it out Wednesday, in between outages.


Michael
