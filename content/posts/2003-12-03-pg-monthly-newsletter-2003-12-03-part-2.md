<pre>The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter December 5, 2003
Books Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Since 1971

In this issue of the Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter Part 2:

1) Editorial
2) News
3) Radio Gutenberg update
4) Mailing list information


Hello,
Hey! Look, it's a desk! Wow! And I thought my computer was balanced on
a big pile of paper. I see someone's tided up too, oh, and are those
clean mugs. Gosh, even the strange looking thing in the fridge that we
had forgotten about has gone. Oh well, there goes the mold growing
experiment. Isn't it amazing what having someone else around can do
for the place.

Well, it is nice to be back after two weeks away, not that I actually
got to go anywhere (Boo!). I have been looking at a few newsletter
related things though, and hopefully, you will notice a few
improvements. Not least of which will be my nice new, never used (no
surprise there) spellchecker! I was looking through some old
newsletters to sort out some features for the website, and I think I
probably have the most forgiving audience ever. There are so many
spelling mistakes, and almost no-one corrects me. I think I could
probably count the emails on one finger in fact. I have to admit to some
surprise at this given the way almost every person in PG I have
contact with leaps in with corrections to mine, and indeed, everyone
elses mistakes at any given opportunity. I look forward to a rapid
improvement in my spelling starting roundabout now.Happy reading,

Alice

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

      If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
      the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
      following:

      1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
      	http://gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
      which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
      http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

      2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
      working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
      years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
      for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
      progress" list:
	      http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

      3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
      date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
      submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
      blank) to:
      	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

      You'll hear back within a few days.

       A Free Public Discussion at the Berkeley Public Library

		  Thursday December 11 2003 7:00 pm

	  THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE OF PROJECT GUTENBERG

A Presentation by Michael Hart, Founder of Project Gutenberg
and Greg Newby, Project Gutenberg CEO

Visit the Berkeley Public Library any time during the week of December
8 to pick up a free CD containing nearly 3,500 of the Project
Gutenberg eBooks, or a DVD with nearly 9,400.  Make copies, and
help spread free literature!

Prof. Hart will present a perspective of the decade it took to move
from 100 eBooks on this date in 1993 to over 100 times as many today,
and the hopes to reach ONE MILLION eBooks a decade or so from now.
Furthermore, he will outline how each of us can help build such a
worldwide public eLibrary.

Come hear how you can get your own library of 10,000 eBooks
on your computer, and how free eBooks can help change the world!

This is the 33rd year Project Gutenberg eBooks have been available
on the Internet and they can always be downloaded free of charge
from hundreds of sites around the world.  Prof. Hart hopes that in
another 33 years nearly any public domain work requested can be made
available, including books, newspapers, magazines, music, paintings,
sculpture [including 3-D] and all other forms of media.

The premise on which Michael Hart based Project Gutenberg was:

"Anything that can be put into a computer can be reproduced indefinitely."

He calls this "Replicator Technology".

The concept of Replicator Technology is simple; once these items are stored
in a computer, then any number of copies can and will be made available.
Everyone in the world can have as many copies as they want.  Even space
travellers, such as NASA Astronaut Shannon Lucid, have taken Project
Gutenberg CDs on record breaking journeys.

Project Gutenberg now has over 10,000 eBooks online at gutenberg.net

Prof. Hart can be contacted directly at:  hart@pobox.com

Newletter Changes and Website Changes

Following my two weeks leave, where I seem to have done even more work
than normal, you should notice a few changes around the place to
improve our service. One of them you won't notice unless I tell you
and that is the automation of our email newsletters. Before almost everything
on the newsletter was done by a human, now hopefully only the article
writing will be (although one of our correspondents has asked for an
article writing machine in their Christmas present list), this means
that you should get your newsletter at the same time each week. What
thia should also mean is that as we will have more time to spend on
them, the article writing quality should be more consistent.

The other change is to the newsletter website, which while still not
quite there, has filled out dramatically over the last few days. Every
feature the newsletter has carried during my editorship is now up
there, along with the reviews and other articles of interest. I hope
to get the last few bells and whistles sorted during this week so it's
all bright and shiny for December 10th.

Other news items this week

PG gains a new mirror site.

Welcome to our newest mirror:  http://www.sakoman.net/gutenberg
Located in San Jose, California.

Thanks to Steve Sakoman.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://www.gutenberg.net allows searching by title, author, language
and subject. Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available
around the world.


These sites and indices are not updated instantly, as additional
research may need to be done by our professional Chief Cataloguer, so
for those who wish to obtain these new ebooks, please refer to the
following section.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that
updated eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99,
etext00, etc.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Radio Gutenberg Update

Radio Gutenberg Update

http://www.radio-gutenberg.org

channel 1 - Sherlock Holmes "The Sign of Four"
channel 2 - Robert Sheckley's "Bad Medicine"

Both are high quality live readings from the collection.

Jon and I are working on a new service for Project Gutenberg
to create an audio book on demand from any of the 10,000+
books in the collection.  This service will be available at
http://www.radio-gutenberg.org shortly.

Anyone needing an audio book of a gutenberg book will be able to
create it for themselves on the web, right when they have the need
for it.

a different format to make your life a little easier. An example of
the changed listing is given below. If you would like either a daily
or weekly version of this list please email news@pglaf.org, and state
which version you require.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Please visit the site:
http://www.pgdp.net for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

 If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

 Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

********

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time or
technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Send email to
dphelp@pgdp.net saying that you are interested in post-processing and we
will help you find a project to work on.
