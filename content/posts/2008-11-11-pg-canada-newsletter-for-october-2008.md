During October Project Gutenberg Canada published a total of 13 eBooks bringing their total to 190 eBooks, which by the way, took Michael Hart's Project Gutenberg twenty-three years to achieve!

**LANGUAGES:**

  * 7 titles in English
  * 5 in French
  * 1 in German (the first title in that language!)

**GENRES**

  * 4 history books and monographs
  * 3 novels
  * 3 books for children
  * 2 biographical monographs
  * 1 book of essays

Eight of this month's eBooks were by Canadians. Seven of this month's releases were non-fiction titles and PGCA has science, philosophy, and economics titles underway.

"This is a very gratifying result: we want to ensure that there is a place of honour in the PGC catalogue for non-fiction", writes Mark.
