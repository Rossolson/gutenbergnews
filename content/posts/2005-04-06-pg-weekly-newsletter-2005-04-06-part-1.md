Starting Jules Verne In German

Robur der Sieger, by Jules Verne  15559
[Language: German] [Link: http://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/5/5/15559 ]
[Files: 15559-8.txt; 15559-h.htm; 15559-t.tex; 15559-pdf.pdf]

Thanks to K.F. Creiner and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

The value of the TeX/PDF in this posting is that it displays
the text with its original Fraktur font.

This is the third language for Robur; we already have it in French
and English, and this is our first translation of Verne into German.

The translator for this 1915 edition is not known.

[We now have about 50 Jules Verne eBooks]

I'll be travelling to Alaska to give some presentations this summer,
so if any of you would like to schedule something along the way,
such as Seattle, Tacoma, Anchorage, etc., please let me know.
By the way, still looking for a gig in North Dakota, the only
state left on my list.  A friend pooped out when we were only
an hour from Fargo. . .hee hee!  mh

The Sony PSP sold all million units shipped to the US in one day,

v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

REQUEST FOR RUSSIAN TRANSLATOR

We are trying to start up a Project Gutenberg Russian Team,
and we need someone to translate simple email messages from

to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,
we need them translated into English, also in a .doc file.
Thanks!!!     Contact Jared Buck  &lt;JBuck814366460@aol.com&gt;

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics

CIA's Electronic Reading Room,      2,019 Reference Files
=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 15,948 eBooks online as of April 06, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.97 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,489,761 [x 15,948 x $.97 = ~$1 trillion]

[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 15,948 eBooks online as of April 06, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.63 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.82 when we had 12,237 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 15,948 eBooks in 33 Years and 09.00 Months We Averaged
      ~473 Per Year
        39.4 Per Month
         1.29 Per Day

At 992 eBooks Done In The 91 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      10.90 Per Day
      76 Per Week
     330 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

*Headline News from Edupage

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

DARPA FUNDS DIVERTED FROM UNIVERSITIES
Confirming rumors among academics at a number of colleges and
universities, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) has acknowledged a shift away from university projects. DARPA
has long been a supporter of broad-ranging, long-term research
initiatives at institutions of higher education, and many credit such
programs with many of the innovations that underpin today's household
technologies. In seeking shorter-term projects with more concrete
deliverables, however, DARPA has significantly cut back funds for
university projects. Since 2001, the portion of DARPA's relatively
stable budget allocated to university projects has dropped by nearly 50
percent. Many in the research community fear that the shift away from
basic, open-ended research will result in slower technological
progress. Ed Lazowska, a computer scientist at the University of
Washington and co-chairman of the President's Information Technology
Advisory Committee, said, "Virtually every aspect of information
technology upon which we rely today bears the stamp of federally
sponsored university research." He characterized DARPA's change in
focus as "killing the goose that laid the golden egg."

CHOICEPOINT OPENS ITS BOOKS TO CONSUMERS
Officials of ChoicePoint, the data aggregation company recently in the
news for compromising the personal information of about 150,000
individuals, said it is developing an application that will allow
consumers to view any information about them that the company collects
and sells. According to Don McGuffey, vice president for data
acquisition at ChoicePoint, "You will receive the reports that we have
on you." The company has also changed the records that it sells to law
enforcement agencies, employers, landlords, and other businesses. Those
records will no longer include complete driver's license or Social
Security numbers--a change implemented in response to legislation
introduced by California State Sen. Jackie Speier that would impose new
limitations on what Speier described as an industry "that has grown up
overnight with no regulations whatsoever."

THIEF GRABS LAPTOP AND 100,000 IDENTITIES
Officials at the University of California at Berkeley said that a
laptop stolen from the university's graduate division contained
personal information for nearly 100,000 individuals. The computer
included records for applicants to Berkeley's graduate programs from
fall 2001 to spring 2004; students enrolled in the school's graduate
programs from fall 1989 to fall 2003; and individuals who received
doctorates from Berkeley between 1976 and 1999. Although no evidence
exists that any of the stolen information has been used fraudulently,
according to a statement from the university, the institution is
required by a California law to disclose the breach to those affected.
The statement said the university is making "every reasonable effort to
notify by mail or e-mail all 98,369 individuals whose names and Social
Security numbers were on the computer."

MEDIA COMPANIES SETTLE WITH FREELANCERS

[If you scratch the surface on this one you will find that ONLY the
big-time commercial writers are benefiting from this settlement,
each article could net them $1500 in royalties. . .BUT. . .Average
Joe or Josephine who is not legally well connected enough to have
registered a separate copyright for each article will ONLY GET $60,
not really enough to pay for the effort of the lawsuits.  Just one
more case where copyright is being used for the rich to get richer
and to make the poor poorer.]

A settlement has been reached in a class action lawsuit between media
companies and freelance writers over stories included in electronic
databases. The class action suit was the combination of three separate
suits and represented defendants including the American Society of
Journalists and Authors, the Authors Guild, the National Writers Union,
and almost two dozen freelance writers. Defendants in the suit,
including Time, Knight Ridder, Reed Elsevier, and The New York Times
Company, agreed to pay between $10 million and $18 million for works
originally published between August 1977 and December 2002. Under the
terms of the settlement, writers who did not sign away electronic
publishing rights can apply for payments of as much as $1,500 for works
that have been added to electronic databases. Although many payments
will be significantly smaller than that, "some freelancers ... will
make six figures under this settlement," according to Jim Morrison, one
of the negotiators of the settlement and a past president of the
American Society of Journalists and Authors.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

If you really want to get a long term grasp of the U.S.
media's news avoidance phobia, compare the news stories
released on Friday, especially late on Friday, compared
to the stories for the rest of the week.

When they really don't want to release a story but they
are actually required to, they announce it late Friday,
so the "news cycle" has been exhausted by the time most
people tune back in on Monday.

By the way, still no official or unofficial comments on
why the Texas City explosion was not really covered, on
Wednesday, two weeks ago.

More On China And India

A QUICK EVOLUTION OF RUFFLED FEATHERS
from Newsday

How do you make a room of university presidents squirm?

Ply them with salmon and sirloin steak and then serve up the political hot
potato of teaching evolution at the high school level.

In a wide-ranging and sometimes heated dinner discussion among media
representatives, Intel chief executive Craig Barrett and the presidents of
eight major research universities, nearly everyone agreed that science in
the United States is losing ground to foreign competitors. Many in
attendance at the Science Coalition's yearly media roundtable, held at The
Penn Club in Manhattan on Monday, cited fast-charging China and India as
important new players, and bemoaned a lack of funding for basic research
at home. And several attendees blasted the nation's K-12 science education
as woefully inadequate.

*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

"The price of a gallon of gas is $2.25, 11 times what
it was when paperback books were also selling at $.25.
This gets nearly daily major news coverage, yet prices
for paperbacks are now $7.50, 30 times what they were
when paperbacks and a gallon of gas were both $.25.
Even coffee prices made the news recently, going up 28%
since Christmas, but what they went up to was the price
they have averaged for the past 20 years.  Why is it
that books can go up so much without any news coverage?"


DOUBLESPEAK OF THE DAY

The term "Depression" was invented by the spin doctors of the day,
because they were afraid the term "Recession" was too inflamatory.

"It's ONLY a depression, not a recession," is what they would say.

Today they have once again reversed themselves yet again, and will
say, "It's ONLY a recession."



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

As Southeast Asia begins to take a predominant place in the world
economies, with China, India, Japan and the US predicted to be in
the Top Four positions a decade or two from now, depressions and/
or recessions in the Western World will have less overall effect,
while changes in The Orient will have a much greater effect.



*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

India now graduates twice as many from college per year than the US.
China?  Twice as many.

*

Dominos will deliver nearly half a billion pizzas in the next year.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
