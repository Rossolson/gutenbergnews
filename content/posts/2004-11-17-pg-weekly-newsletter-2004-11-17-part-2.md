.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

=============================================================================

"For those wishing to know. . .", David Price provides elucidation on a
couple of this week's postings:

About #14062, Miscellanies, by Oscar Wilde:

It's a collection of odds and ends by Oscar Wilde.  We have a good number
of them already in Gutenberg but some new ones are here, together with an
introduction by Wilde's friend Robert Ross.


About #14061, Lady Byron Vindicated, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, David sends
along the following note submitted by volunteer Les Bowler:

The poet, George Gordon Byron, Lord Byron married Anne Milbanke in 1815,
but the marriage was short-lived -- Anne returned to her parents with a
daughter of the marriage after about a year and didn't see her husband
again.  She seems to have been a formal, rather religious person, while
Byron had a reputation for scandalous behaviour both before and after the
marriage, and rumours abounded as to the causes of the split.

In 1869, after both Lord Byron and Anne Milbanke were dead, and following
the publication of a book by the Countess Guiccioli, the mistress of Lord
Byron, certain English periodicals published articles laying the blame
entirely upon Lady Byron, and branding her "a liar" and "the vilest of
criminals"  --  all this with virtually no response  from Lady Byron's
friends.

Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, who had known Lady Byron for some years
before her death in 1860, then felt it her duty to publish "Lady Byron
Vindicated" in defence of her late friend.  The book proved to be
controversial, with Lord Byron's friends denying many of the allegations,
including incest, referred to by Mrs. Stowe, but on the whole it seems a
quite convincing explanation of the reasons for the break-down of the
marriage.

About #14016, John Knox and the Reformation, by Andrew Lang:

For those interested: John Knox was a famous Scottish protestant who was
very involved in the politics of the reformation.  Until Lang wrote this
book it was established practise to hold Knox as a sort of saint.  In
this book Lang goes through Knox's life, writings and works - and paints
a very unflattering picture of him.

As an aside: outside of religion Knox is best known, or rather imfamous,
for writing "The First Blast of the Trumpet against the monstrous
regiment of Women" - a text which is available from Project Gutenberg.
[EBook #9660 -- Ed.]

For another opinion on John Knox, folk might like to read Robert Louis
Stevenson's article on "Knox and His Relations to Women" - which appears
in the book "Familiar Studies of Men and Books" - again available from
Gutenberg.  [EBook #425 -- Ed.]
