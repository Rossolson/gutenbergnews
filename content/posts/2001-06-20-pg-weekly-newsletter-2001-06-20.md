***Only two weeks to our 30th Anniversary Newsletter***

If you have sent in Etexts to be posted, but are not sure they have been,
or have sent in copyright research, please let me know [hart@pobox.com].

If our catalog on gutenberg.net [promo.net/pg] misses them, please let Alev,
our Chief Cataloguer know Alev Akman &lt;alevwho@mediaone.net&gt;.  She is sure
she is up to date with all the entries she has, but some may not have been
received in her email, or could have been lost in various crashes.


When we send out the Project Gutenberg Newsletters, we
have already posted all the files listed in that index
listing we include in the Newsletters [excepting those
marked as "reserved," of course.

While our human cataloguers and indexers of course can
not had time to add them to their files yet, computers
will already have them listed. . .and thus you will be
able to download them, literally only one second after
we have started to post them, even before our own post
of them has been completely uploaded. . . !

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:
http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03
or
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91, 90.


You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.


We have a total of 18 new files to download this week:
[This would yield a total of 936 new files per year.]


If you sent in a file you don't see here, or sent in a revision, or xeroxes
for our copyright research, and haven't heard from me let me know.  Most of
these should only take a few days.

Lakshana: Autopsy of a Century was published in 1994 by CrossRoads Books as
Volume VIII in The West and the Wider World Series.  Though copies have been
available for purchase through Amazon, it is now out of print.

Lakshana: Autopsy of a Century takes a look at the boy-beast contract.
First: as it appears in myths of the mutant centaur's cave.  Next, as it is
brought up to date to implement the demands of technology's cosmic cave.  An
attempt is made to show how Einstein, Planck and Picasso (and others) decked
out the cave in a stunning array of modern artifacts.  The impact and
consequences of this on children of the millennium is discussed.  Noam
Chomsky said of the book, "Poignant and compelling."

There are both WordPerfect and HTML versions you can work from,
and a number of illustrations.  If we release this book we will
want to do both a plain text and HTML version.  Please contact:
Mark Slade &lt;lakshana@portal.ca&gt;, and cc: me

Excerpts from Edupage and Newsscan


AOL-MICROSOFT TALKS ENDED BY GROWING RIVALRY
Microsoft and AOL this weekend disagreed over the future of their
software alliance and abandoned negotiations concerning the new
Windows XP release. AOL wanted to continue an existing agreement
to feature AOL software prominently on the desktop system, but
the two firms reportedly reached an impasse over AOL's
relationship with Microsoft rival RealNetworks. As Microsoft
plans to offer more and more customer services through the
Internet, it is finding itself at odds with AOL on many fronts.
Besides the issue of AOL's exclusive deal with RealNetworks,
AOL still refuses to open its AOL Instant Messenger system to
competing instant messaging systems. AOL executives say the
failure to close a deal with Microsoft is not significant to
them because they are confident about their other means of
reaching end users, including contracts with computer makers
to preload their software.
(New York Times, 18 June 2001)

COMPUTER TAX BENEFIT FAVORS TOP BRACKETS
The tax legislation signed into law by President Bush earlier
this month may help some families purchase PCs for children. The
legislation lets taxpayers contribute up to $2,000 to a savings
account. Taxpayers can then use the tax-free earnings from this
account for "qualified expenses" for education, such as tuition,
school clothing, and computers. Sen. George Allen (R-Va.)
supported the measure, whose aim, according to a statement, was
"to reduce taxes so that parents could more easily purchase
computers, Internet access, and educational software." However,
the program works through a tiered system that is of the greatest
benefit to taxpayers in the highest bracket. For example,
taxpayers in the top bracket would be able to spend up to $579
toward computers and peripherals. However, the majority of
taxpayers would be limited to $225. The lowest-income taxpayers
would receive nothing because they pay little or no taxes.
(New York Times, 18 June 2001)

SENATE APPROVES STUDENT PRIVACY BILL
The Student Privacy Protection Act, legislation sponsored by
Sens. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), has
been passed by the Senate as an add-on to the education reform
bill. The Shelby-Dodd bill protects the privacy of children's
personal data by prohibiting schools from collecting such data
for commercial purposes unless parents have granted their
permission. The American Association of School Administrators
and the National School Board Association are fighting the bill,
which they criticize as overly restrictive.
(Newsbytes, 15 June 2001)

SENATE PASSES BILL EXTENDING COPYRIGHT EXEMPTIONS
The U.S. Senate on Friday approved the Technology, Education,
and Copyright Harmonization Act. The legislation, written by Sens.
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), would extend
traditional copyright privileges to nonprofit distance-education
courses. The law would cover "dramatic literary and musical
works," such as film clips and popular songs, which have long
been allowed in the classroom. Leahy says the act "reflects our
understanding that we must be able to use new technologies to
advance our education goals in a manner that recognizes and
protects copyrighted works." The legislation must still gain
approval from the House of Representatives, where it is sponsored
by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), and from President Bush.

MICROSOFT AND AOL TIME WARNER END TALKS ON WINDOWS XP
Negotiations between Microsoft and AOL Time Warner regarding the use of AOL
software in the next version of the Windows operating system have
collapsed, bringing relations between the two companies to a new low. Each
side blamed the other for the failure of talks, which have been ongoing for
the past 10 weeks. AOL said Microsoft objected to AOL's inclusion of
RealNetworks' RealPlayer software with its Internet access service. "The
talks broke down over Microsoft's determination to control digital music on
the Internet," said an AOL spokesman. But Microsoft insisted the two
companies were unable to reach agreement on a number of issues. "We are
disappointed the discussions between AOL and Microsoft ended without
agreement on a broad range of issues between them," said Microsoft in a
statement. "While unable to conclude a broader view, we will continue our
work to ensure the AOL service runs well on Windows XP." (Financial Times

BOOKS BY THE NUMBERS
When is a best-seller not a best-seller? When it's sales are interpreted
imaginatively rather than presented in hard, cold numbers. But poetic
renderings of sales figures may soon come to an end, because a company
called Bookscan, a unit of the media group VNU of the Netherlands, is about
to introduce a system that will disseminate sales information collected at
the cash registers of bookstores nationwide. Bookscan has cut already cut
deals with Borders, Barnes & Noble, Costco, and Target, and will record
more than half the book sales in the United States. Jennifer Rudolph Walsh
of the William Morris agency says:  "Something like that could actually be
the death of some kinds of literary darlings -- when you try to sell the
next book, the perception of their sales would be, frankly, so true to life
that it would prevent people from looking at the big picture, that a book
is prestigious or has prize potential or is well reviewed or
something."  (New York Times 18 Jun 2001)

DICK ARMEY CONTINUES OPPOSITION TO CARNIVORE
In a letter to Attorney General John Ashcroft, House majority leader Dick
Armey (R-Texas) is urging the Justice Department and the FBI to consider
abandoning its DCS-1000 system (popularly known as "Carnivore"), which
monitors large amounts of Internet traffic in search of communications to
or from the target of an investigation. Armey noted that the Supreme Court
has just ruled that the police must discontinue use of thermal-imaging
technology to look inside a suspect's house, and argued that the same
privacy principles apply to Carnivore. (New York Times 14 Jun 2001)
