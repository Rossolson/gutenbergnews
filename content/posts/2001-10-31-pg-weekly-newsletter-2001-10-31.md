We're looking for copies of older newsletters for historical purposes --
they seem to have gone missing.  Specifically we're looking for the
following:  Feb, 1997; Jan-May plus Aug-Sep-Oct, 1996; and for
any newsletters prior to 1996, although we do have Mar of 1995 and Sep of
1994.  If you have any of these newsletters, please send a copy to George
Davis &lt;gbdavis at harborside dot com&gt;.  Thank you.

How much shelf space would all of Project Gutenberg's e-texts occupy
if they were physical books? There are about 2,450,000,000 bytes worth
of ASCII texts online. Assuming that each leaf contains 2,200 bytes,
and 10,000 leafs would be 1 meter thick, and the front and back
covers of a book total about 1/2 a centimeter in thickness, calculate:

[(4,059 books) x (0.005 meters total cover thickness per book)] +
[(1 meter thickness per 10,000 leafs) x (2,450,000,000 bytes / 2200 bytes
per leaf)] = 20.3 + 111.4 = 131.7 meters.

Granted, this isn't *really* accurate to within 4 significant figures,
as mathematicians/scientists might point out, but it is something of
a ballpark...thanks for Lars Aronnson and Martin Ward for tips on
refining the calculation from the previous newsletter.

NOTE:  This week, we have posted 23 new etexts. We have also
posted a significant number of new versions of existing Etexts,
including versions for portable devices, Microsoft reader, as
well as .HTML versions.  This first section of revisions and
corrections is, therefore, unusually longer than normal.  The
section announcing newly posted editions follows this long
section.

The following texts have been modified significantly and an
improved version has been posted.  PLEASE NOTE:  The index
line has also been changed.  Subsequent REpostings will
follow to handle new versions in formats other than (txt):

of titles is not as high as the Etext ####'s might indicate. . .and
we are also working on two sections now, the 4000's and the 4100's

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 10/31/01**:  4,059  (TODAY!!!)
(This number includes the 13 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

Thru 10/31/01:  43 Weeks & 2 Days (303 days)
               1,009 total new etexts, yr-to-date.
               Weekly avg.:  23.47
               Daily avg:     3.33

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,009 For 303 days,
this is 3.33 per day or 23.47 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1,215 For The Year. . . .
We are about 43 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.

INTERNET ANNALS ERECT BILLIONS OF WEB PAGES BACK IN TIME
People will be able to view and research the history of the
Internet as far back as 1996 through the Internet Archive, a free
repository of more than 10 billion Web pages (those still in use
and defunct) that is five times the size of the Library of
Congress. "It will allow researchers to study the evolution of
the Web in a way that is unprecedented," declared Ed Chi of the
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. The archive is the brainchild
of former supercomputer technologist Brewster Kahle. The archive,
which is updated every two months, uses bots to probe the Web for
pages to add; pages that require passwords are ignored, while page
owners can request that their pages not be captured if they so
desire. However, Stanford University's Lawrence Lessig warned that
Kahle could be sued for copyright infringement because of the
repository. The Internet Archive was funded by the Library of
Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, the National Science
Foundation, and Compaq Computer. (Los Angeles Times, 25 October 2001)

COLLEGES TURN TO BANDWIDTH SHAPERS TO THROTTLE NEEDLESS USE
Colleges are employing bandwidth shapers to prioritize certain
transmissions so that recreational traffic does not overwhelm
more critical traffic. For example, Loyola University uses a
bandwidth shaper to prevent congestion caused by the KaZaA
file-sharing service and allow its students easier access to
downloadable course materials and assignments. The shaper was
even more helpful in the aftermath of last month's terrorist
attacks, when students and faculty were trying to reach friends
and family by e-mail; the device was used to lower recreational
Web surfing and give e-mail more consideration. Bandwidth shapers
were originally created with commercial applications in mind. The
U.S. Navy, for instance, uses them to prioritize military transmissions.

COLLEGES EXPERIMENT WITH IP TELEPHONY
An increasing number of colleges are routing telephone calls over
the Internet. The institutions have found IP telephony to be less
costly than charges for local services. Menlo College, for
example, has reduced its monthly fees for its 100 administrative
phones from about $11,000 to about $1,000 since implementing an
IP phone network, according to director of information technology
Patrick Olson. He also noted that phone service consumes
relatively little of the networks' bandwidth. In addition, Menlo
has set up two call-management servers to add redundancy. Keeping
IP telephone service campus-bound allows colleges "to control the
links from both ends" while dodging local charges, said Texas A&M
University's Walter R. Magnussen Jr. The largest cost savings of
IP telephony will come when a method for automatically updating
network databases to reflect any changes or movements of student
telephones is worked out, noted Columbia University's Henning G.
Schulzrinne. (Chronicle of Higher Education Online, 23 October 2001)

[Remember what Heinlein said about ID cards. . .he would say

NATIONAL ID CARD FAILING TO ATTRACT SUPPORTERS
Neither the Bush administration nor congressional leaders have
embraced Oracle CEO Larry Ellison's proposal to create a national
ID card system. Conservatives and civil liberties groups have
come out against the measure, citing concerns about racial
profiling and the potential for misuse and error. Although
Ellison discussed his proposal with Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.), among others, she reportedly has not endorsed it.
Instead, Feinstein is focusing on legislation to issue biometric
ID cards to non-citizens entering the country, and to build a
database of criminal records that the immigration authorities can
reference. Smart cards may also be used in a wider capacity by
military and law enforcement officials, such as enhanced cards for
special airline passengers, according to the FAA's Paul Takemoto.

APPLE SHINES NEW IBOOKS, POWERBOOKS
Apple Computer's new iBook and PowerBook G4 models were released
this week without the usual fanfare, but the upgrades and
upper-tier price cuts are significant steps forward for the
notebook lines. Besides making the customary increases in
processing power and hard-drive capacity to the higher-end
PowerBooks and the midrange iBooks, Apple also started integrating
the 802.11b standard AirPort wireless networking card with some
models. The card was included standard in all PowerBooks and
could be connected to built-in wireless antennas in the iBooks.
Technology Business Research analyst Tim Deal said Apple had done
a good job of cutting prices while adding functionality to their
notebooks.   (ZDNet, 16 October 2001)

INDIANA UNIVERSITY UPGRADES ITS SUPERCOMPUTER
The IBM RS/6000 SP supercomputer at Indiana University will be
capable of one trillion calculations per second following a major
upgrade announced on Wednesday. This capability will make it the
most powerful university-owned machine in the nation, according
to officials. IBM will receive $5 million from the university for
the upgrade, which is expected to triple the computer's
computational and storage capacity. The supercomputer will be
used in genomics research. One of its major operations will be
matching genomic data to the university's patient-record database,
explained university CIO Michael A. McRobbie. The supercomputer
will also be used to supplement genomic research projects with
three-dimensional visualization, high-speed network connections,
and the development of new research applications.

APPLE UNVEILS iPOD MUSIC PLAYER
Apple Computer has launched its iPod digital music player, which can store
as many as 1,000 songs on its hard drive. The $399 device sports a 5GB hard
drive and connects to a Mac via FireWire. "This is going to be the hottest
gift this holiday season" for Mac fans, says CEO Steve Jobs. The iPod is
about the size of a deck of cards and features an LCD display that
identifies the artist, song and album title of the music playing. Using the
FireWire port, people can download an entire CD onto the iPod in under 10
seconds, and 1,000 songs in less than 10 minutes, according to the company.

BELL LABS DEVELOPS NANO-TRANSISTOR
Bell Labs, the famed research division of Lucent Technologies, has
developed a transistor created from molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and
sulfur, and Bell Labs researchers have designed a simple logic circuit
using a pair of organic transistors. Nano-transistors, which eventually
will allow further shrinkage of the size of computing devices and increase
their processing power, can be developed without the use of expensive chip
lithography tools. Bell Labs physicist Hendrik Schoen says of the new
transistors: "Instead of fancy optics, they used molecules as the spacers
and as the active devices. We have an exquisite degree of control here. We
know the precise structure of the molecules. We can make a whole jar of
them." (AP/Washington Post 18 Oct 2001)
