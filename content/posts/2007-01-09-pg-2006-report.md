    Last year we first started counting PGEu and PrePrints but I never got an accurate listing of the duplications from a PGEU listing and the overall totals. Our new editor has it much more accurately figured out since he started and will start accounting for these duplications next week. Expect the grand total to drop by about 350, from where you might have expected it under last years accounting. Please note the addition of the PGEu totals will make last year bigger and this coming year smaller, as we started with about 200 PGEu duplications and ended up with about 350.

      <strong>WARNING:</strong> After our 35th anniversary, the PGAu counts were kept separately rather than added in this count, and any error in making up for that is MINE (M. Hart). Our 35 anniversary was July 4, 2006.
