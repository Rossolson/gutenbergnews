<pre>The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter EXTRA, July 18, 2009
eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


I'm sending this out now because I have serious doubts as to whether I will be
able to do this very easily when the Newsletter is actually due.  This may be
the last time on this hard drive that I actually get booted up, and it was
pretty much just luck that got me this far.

I'll be buying some new computers this week, I hope, with the hopes that I
will be more or less back to normal, but right now the thing won't even let me
make backups as the USB ports have power, but don't recognize any drives.

I'm actually dialed up on the modem right now.

If any of you have any suggestions as to the best deals I should be looking at
for laptops and netbooks, please let me know, and please cc:

The Brief News


We are rapidly coming up to our 25,000th eBook in English and all suggestions
for what title to use are welcome.

This should take place next month.

In addition, we are coming up on our 30,000th PG eBook of all languages
perhaps a month or so after that, so we are also looking for a great eBook in
another language to put up as #30,000.

We are giving away about 75,000 books per day through the http://www.gutenberg
org server, for ~2 million per month and the monthly total was often over 3
million per month, all told over the past 4 years or so.

This means we have given away over 100 million books over the past 4 years,
just through that one site alone.



The World eBook Fair


In addition, over these same four years we have sponsored The World eBook Fair
along with The Internet Archive, The World Public Library,
ebooksabouteverything.org, etc.

http://www.worldebookfair.org handed out a million files, just on one day
alone, July 4, to start up this 39th year of presenting eBooks on the
Internet.

Please note:  this is less than a million eBooks, as some entries are multi-
file in nature.

Traffic has since dropped to about half that, with a very healthy 50,000
downloads per day of our "best sellers."

In its first year The World eBook Fair gave away nearly a total of 30 million
eBooks, and if the averages have been at 25 million over the 4 years, that's a
200 million book total over those two URLs over a 4 year period, or totals
somewhere in that range.

This does not count all the other sites such as Australia or Canada or PG of
Europe, etc.



The Current PG Totals

I'm not sure I have time right now to fill in everything, with monthly
comparisons as I usually do, as I am running mostly on adrenaline right now
and will have to stop soon to eat, sleep, shower, etc.

Here are the brief reports you can compare to last month:

I will also try to get back online after the fact and try to redo a real
Newsletter with all info as of July 21st.

Here are today's numbers for languages with 200+ eBooks:

Grand total for today: 29326

24725   English en
1442    French  fr
587     German  de
508     Finnish fi
433     Dutch   nl
402     Chinese zh
338     Portuguese      pt
242     Spanish es
202     Italian it

We have recently been averaging just under 10 books per day with some very
good days that are much better.

If we are lucky, we may do 3,500 to 4,000 books for 2009.

Not to mention the hundreds of books that have been updated and improved,
corrected, etc.


Many thanks to all who have helped us reach our 39th year!
