If you receive the [PG Newsletter](/newsletter/) each week you will know that I am stepping down as the editor. I've had a great time and I am very grateful to Michael and Greg for giving me a chance to try my own ideas for the newsletter, including starting up the _Gutenberg News_ website. If you're wondering, yes, _Gutenberg News_ will stay live and up-to-date. I will continue on as webmaster.

As my last entry I would like to introduce the new Newsletter Team!

With such a great response to our request for a replacement editor, it was a natural choice to create a team of editors. The new editors, from both sides of the pond, are Stacey, Jared and Andra≈æ.

You can bet they will be digging up some interesting and diverse news relating to Project Gutenberg, eBooks and publishing in general. Very likely a few surprises too!

Kindest Regards,

Michael Cook
