Project Gutenberg of Canada Releases 500th eBook!!!


It is:

"Forty Years of Song" by Emma Albani, first published in 1911.

Emma Albani (1847-1930) was the first Canadian singer to gain
a worldwide reputation, which is rather something considering
the combination of Canada's low population and remoteness for
the time period.  Think of how much "easier" it was for Piaf.
"Easier" quotes because Edith Piaf did not have an easy time,
but it was certainly easier for the world to find HER.


Here's some information about Albani:
