As I'm sure everyone is aware, Obama was inaugurated as the new U.S. President this last week and we now have the Official Transcript of the _Inaugural Presidential Address_. This can be found in the Gutenberg archives at; [www.gutenberg.org/etext/28001](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/28001 "Official Transcript of the Obama Inaugural Presidential Address")

This is now the 44th US Presidential Inaugural Speech and Project Gutenberg has all these compiled into one eText (Obama's will be added shortly) which is available at; [www.gutenberg.org/etext/4938](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4938 "Compilation of all Presidential Addresses at Gutenberg.org")

#### 400 Chinese eBooks in our Archives

With the help of many volunteers the Gutenberg.org Chinese eBook Library has reached 400 titles. Many thanks to everyone involved in helping to get these Chinese books in to our archives.

#### Project Gutenberg on Twitter

In a further step to expanding the PG community I have now set up a Project Gutenberg account at Twitter.com.

[http://twitter.com/GutenbergNews](http://twitter.com/GutenbergNews "Project Gutenberg News Twitter Acocunt")

Any news or interesting info that we come across relating to Project Gutenberg will get its Twitter announcement, in 140 characters or less.

The full [January Newsletter can be viewed in our archives](https://www.gutenbergnews.org/20090124/pg-newsletter-archives-2009/ "Project Gutenberg January 2009 Newsletter").
