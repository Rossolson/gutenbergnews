<pre>PG NEWSLETTER JUNE 1996


Please send your feedback directly to
Michael S. Hart hart@pobox.com

This is not the actual newsletter sent out to subscribers, but it is the contents. If you have a copy of the actual newsletter sent we would love to receive a copy for the archive.


Books Index update from #577 to #608.

Due to receiving notice from the system administor of the computer we have
been sending this Project Gutenberg Newsletter from for the last 5 months,
after losing our account at vmd.cso.uiuc.edu, we have burned things up for
the last day or so and completed all the books for July, 1996, which marks
the end of our 25th year as the oldest Internet information provider: and
which might mark the end of our unofficial relationship at the university.
This account might vanish any time after midnight, as the date suddenly is
June 10 for us leaving this computer.

We are not sure how we will be reaching you after midnight, but we will be
working on as many ways as possible.

We have been assured by some that this account would remain, and by others
that it will be gone by the time you likely read this.

Therefore the 32 July, 1996, 25th Anniversary Project Gutenberg Etexts are
listed below, and should all be available from
uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu in a few hours, if the relay works at 3:00 AM CDT.
We managed to get all but a last one or two ready by the 3:00 PM relay.

For the moment, we strongly encourage all those who have been considering,
or who might consider, the placement of the Project Gutenberg Etexts on an
assortment of systems around the world. We don't place any restriction on
who can place our files where, as long as they don't charge for them: but
most of them are available even for that purpose, without royalties to us,
IF. . .you don't use the Project Gutenberg name which is a TradeMark: and
don't use the copyrighted Etexts, which are clearly marked inside the file
and also with a "C" following the Etext number in our indices.

Obviously, we could use your help more than ever right now in many ways:

1. Keep sending in your suggestions for the books you want to work on, or
that you want us to work on.

2. Make sure you find editions from before 1921, and, if possible, the edition
should be from before 1906, because we may have to delete a few million books
from our list of possible books to do if the laws that are currently proposed
in the US are passed, which it looks as if will be the case, since our
legislators will not talk about it-- this will mean we will have to delete
perhaps a hundred books which are currently available from our US sites.
We have moved many to a new offshore data haven, and are researching their
copyright laws-- if you know of any country with short copyright terms, let
us know!

3. If you would care to make a financial contribution, perhaps to help us
get incorporated as a non-profit 501-3(C) corporation, or if you know a lawyer
who could help, this could well be the best time.

4. Checks should be made out to: "Project Gutenberg/BU," as Illinois Benedictine
College is now Benedictine University, 5700 College Rd, Lisle, IL 60532-0900
[Every penny goes to Project Gutenberg, and I am VERY appreciative of their
great help.]

5. There are a dozen companies selling Project Gutenberg Etexts in the clear
violation of our TradeMark. The only one that supports us is Walnut Creek
CDROM. Email them at info@cdrom.com. There is a new, brand new, I don't even
have a copy yet, edition out, and it may be the last one you can get with
books from 1906 to 1920, if the newer and more restrictive copyrights continue
to be passed.

6. One way or another, I will find a way to answer all mail sent to me at
"hart@pobox.com". . .save a copy, you might have to send twice-- which will
not be pobox.com's fault, but mine, as I may have no way to answer sometimes.
That address currently forwards to this one-- AND to hart@prairienet.org--which
is helping as a stopgap solution, but which probably could not handle all
our traffic.

7. My heartfelt thanks to all who have enjoyed our work over 25 years, and
to all those who have helped us do the work, all over the world as well as
all over the United States. While I fully expect to say hello to you all
again, obviously the day will come when you should not expect to hear from
me any longer, as my life expectancy is not as long into the future as has
been my past with Project Gutenberg. I hope I can encourage you to continue
this wonderful experience.

For all history there has never been enough of anything for us except a supply
of air for us to breathe, and now, for the first time, there has been enough
copies of some books, that everyone for the rest of history can have a copy.

Please don't let this first time for something like this be the last.

I have enjoyed doing Project Gutenberg more than I could ever imagine!!

Thanks for sharing it with me.

Michael S. Hart

If you don't stop them, they will totally eliminate the Public Domain-- and
all information will come through commercial vendors, who each have their
own biases and slants on how they want you to see information.

"Life is an open book test, and they are trying to close the books."

To get the Project Gutenberg Etexts for the near future:
ftp uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu or ftp 128.174.5.14
login: anonymous
password: yourname@your.machine
cd pub
cd etext
cd gutenberg
cd etext95
[or 94, 93, 92, 91 or 90. 70's and 80's
are in /etext90]
get filename
(be sure to set bin, if you get the .zip files)
get more files
quit


get INDEX?00.GUT ? = 1,2,4,8 New files in etext96, of course.

Project Gutenberg Web Sites can now be reached at:

http://promo.net/pg/ [This is the definitive site for now]

Please post this information anywhere you can, and try to get our old site
listings at jg.cso.uiuc.edu replaces with these.

Thanks!
