<a href="http://www.travelbraille.com" target="_blank">TravelBraille.com</a> is taking requests for Braille transcriptions of
Gutenberg.org eBooks to BRF Braille. The transcriptions will be prepared by a
US Library of Congress Certified Braille Transcriber. There will be NO charge
for this service.

No assurance can or will be given that any particular file will be
transcribed – priority will be given to those files in the Gutenberg Top 100
eBooks, Top 100 eBook Authors, and, quite frankly, the personal taste of the
Transcriber.

Some of these files may require detailed editing as to punctuation, Braille
contraction, formatting, chapter arrangements, etc. Volumes will be
approximately 150K each to make them easier to load into Braille NoteTakers,
etc. Formatting, editing, headers, chapter headings, page numbering, etc. will
meet or exceed 'Formatted Scan Quality'. The files will be structured for both
refreshable Braille and paper embossing.

For now, all requests must be submitted through the website '<a href="http://www.travelbraille.com/contactus.html" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>' page.

As this will be a free service, your patience will be kindly appreciated.

_— John Edwin Miller, USA Library of Congress Certified Braille Transcriber._
