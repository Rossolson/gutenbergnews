After 12 years of research involving more than one hundred people, Marie Lebert has posted English translations of her work on 40 years of eBooks. To help you navigate through the series we've created this post to act as the Table of Contents for the articles.

<p style="clear: both;">
  Each essays title is prefixed with the word "eBooks" followed by a date, then title, and each post includes a link to the next essay in the series, along with a link back to this TOC.
