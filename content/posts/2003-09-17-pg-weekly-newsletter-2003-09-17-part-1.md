******eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Over 32 Years*******



                        New eBook Milestones


     We Reached 1/2 Of The Way From 9,000 to 10,000 Yesterday!!!


                 9505 Books Done. . .495 To Go. . . !


               We're Over 19/20 Of The Way To 10,000!!!


Correction:  I reported 102 new eBooks last week, it actually was 101.
We could use a volunteer to spend perhaps 10 minutes per day helping
us check that our count is perfectly accurate as we approach 10,000.
Please email me if you are willing to help us with this.


Here is a rough graph of our progress toward 10,000 eBooks:

Interested in music?  Project Gutenberg's music project
(http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music) is seeking people to
digitize musical scores.  We also have a small budget to

!!!

I need a copy of zip for AIX that can do the "-9" high compression,
and still unzip via the standard unzip programs!!!

***

I am working on trying to collect and convert some public domain folk tunes
to ABC notation.  Could use some help tracking down public domain versions
of the melodies or proof that these songs are in the public domain.  Songs
I'm working on at present include:
I Know Where I'm Going
Simple Gifts
She Moved Throught The Fair
A Sailor Courted a Farmer's Daughter (aka Constant Lovers)
The Fisher Who Died in His Bed
Ufros Alienu
If anyone's interesting in converting folk songs to a digital public
domain format and would like to help or if you want to contact me, you can
do so through the mailing list at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pdsongs

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test DVD here right now!!!  Nearly all
of our first 9,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have
regular needs for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby AT pglaf.org&gt; ,
if you can help.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help a lot, by simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM OUR MIRROR SITES

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://gutenberg.net/list.html  can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer.


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 37 weeks of this year, we have produced 2762 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 2762 eBooks!!!

         That's 37 WEEKS as Compared to ~30 YEARS!!!


With 9,505 eBooks online as of September 10, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.05 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.67 when we had 5977 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 9,505 books each costing $.62 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 9,505 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 9505 eBooks in 32 Years and 3.25 Months We Averaged
    295 Per Year   [About as many as we do per month these days!]
     25 Per Month
    .80 Per Day

At 2762 eBooks Done In The 259 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     10.7 Per Day
     74.6 Per Week
    325.3 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production

[Who Was That Masked Man?  The One Touting Terabytes For All?]

IBM LAYS OUT PLAN FOR INTELLIGENT BRICKS
Researchers at IBM's Almaden Research Center are proposing a new type of
computer configuration -- one that involves Lego-like stacking of so-called
Collective Intelligent Bricks to build a customized data storage center.
The bricks are really cubes with edges measuring 20cm and inside each brick
are 12 disk drives, each of which can store 80 gigabytes of data. The
bricks house a processor to run the disks and a chip that enables the
connectors on the outside of the brick to link to other bricks for data
exchange. The transmission rate between connectors is now relatively slow
-- 3 gigabits per second -- but lead scientist Jai Menon is hoping to boost
that to 10 gigabits soon -- a rate comparable to high-speed fiber optic
connections. And while there are still cooling issues to be worked out
(it's hard to keep all those components cool when they're packed so tightly
together), the brick design has one feature that engineers value the most
-- redundancy. If one brick goes bad, the network of connections can be
routed around it to isolate it, and back-up copies of all data can be
stored in multiple bricks to ensure no failure would be catastrophic. (The

[It's Only The "Industrial Smoke And Mirrors" eBooks That Are Out,
Those Who Want Huge Profits Without Offering Huge Advantages. . .]

E-BOOKS TAKE A HIT, BUT DON'T COUNT THEM OUT
The future of e-books got slightly more fuzzy last week when Barnes & Noble
announced it was closing down its eBooks store, but industry watchers say
the long-term forecast for the nascent market is still upbeat. And while
today's e-book technology is viewed by many as a solution in search of a
problem, companies like Microsoft, Palm and Adobe stand firmly behind their
investments in the industry. "We think that in the long-term, e-book
technology has a great future. Market acceptance has not taken off quite as
quickly as was predicted, but we are certainly continuing to invest in this
area," says an Adobe spokesman. And while it may be a long wait until the
average consumer turns to e-books for pleasure reading, e-books may
ultimately find their niche with tech-savvy youth accustomed to on-screen
browsing and the burgeoning cohort of retiring baby boomers, predicts
Richard Doherty, research director at Envisioneering Group. "Two audiences
that will benefit best are young people who loathe the idea of a library,
and aging people who want the convenience of large type on demand" and the
freedom from lugging hefty hard copy around. (Reuters 14 Sep 2003)

[Peace In Our Time. . .???]  [That's NOT The Chicago Way!!!]

ANTI-SPAM EFFORT WOULD PAY SPAMMERS TO STOP
A new anti-spam service, called Global Removal, is taking a different
approach to fighting spam -- it's proposing to pay spammers for cooperating
with their effort. Internet users fed up with junk e-mail would pay a $5
lifetime fee to have their e-mail addresses put on a Global Removal
do-not-spam list. Addresses on the list would be cross-referenced and
deleted from mailing lists maintained by Global's partners, which include
more than 50 known spammers and an equal number of legitimate e-mail
marketers. These partners would be rewarded for their diligence through an
affiliate program, which would pay $1 for every new subscriber that they
bring to the service. In order to avoid a new flood of spam touting Global
Removal's service, the spammers would be allowed to send only one message
to their purged mailing lists. "Despite the urban legend, these guys don't
really want to keep these names on their lists if they know that the people
aren't going to be receptive to advertising," says Global CEO Tom Jackson.
"They can make more money for less effort through our program." Critics say
the flaw in Global's sales pitch is that subscribers would still receive
junk e-mail from spammers not affiliated with Global and that Global's
spammers could always renege on their deal and go back to their old lists.
One intellectual property lawyer says, "It's a little like paying
protection money to mob bosses. There's precious little assurance about the
comprehensiveness of the protection, or that the prices won't go up at the
whim of the 'bosses.'" Still, if spammers "could be assured some minimum
bit of income by not sending me mail, it's a better deal for them and a
relief to me." (Wired.com 15 Sep 2003)

 [Can Those Who Draw The Internet Maps Send YOU to .com, .net, or AOL?]
[Remember That Quote:  "S/he Who Controls The Agenda Controls Outcome"?]

VERISIGN'S SITE FINDER PROFITS FROM TYPOS
Internet registrar VeriSign has launched a new service, Site Finder, that
offers users who mistype a URL a list of alternative Web sites that they
might be trying to reach. Several ISPs do the same thing -- most notably
AOL and MSN -- but critics say that because VeriSign controls the directory
computers for ".com" and ".net" names, they could easily reroute all
queries to Site Finder. "We put so much of our research into developing
this AOL search result page," says an AOL spokesman. "We are reviewing our
potential options. We are strongly opposed to them interjecting themselves
into our members' search experience." Site Finder's suggestions include
both standard search results and pay-for-placement advertisements, which
are identified as such. But while VeriSign VP Ben Turner says the new
service is designed to "improve overall usability of the Internet," Danny
Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Watch, warns that Site Finder's
capabilities could also be abused -- by directing users only to
pay-for-placement sites, for instance. Meanwhile, the new service provides
a much-needed new revenue stream for the Internet registrar. "Right now,
VeriSign's business is not a growing business, and anything that they do to
add the slightest amount of growth is going to be positive," says an
analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. (AP 15 Sep 2003)

SBC RESISTS SUBPOENAS TO IDENTIFY MUSIC DOWNLOADERS
In another challenge to the recording industry, No. 2 regional phone
company and Internet service provider SBC is refusing to comply with
subpoenas requiring it and other ISPs to turn over to the Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA) the identities of subscribers
suspected of music copyright infringers. SBC's general counsel James D.
Ellis sees it as a privacy issue: "Clearly, there are serious legal issues
here, but there are also these public policy privacy issues. We have
unlisted numbers in this industry, and we've got a long heritage in which
we have always taken a harsh and hard rule on protecting the privacy of our
customers' information." Matthew J. Oppenheim, a top RIAA executive, says:
"SBC believes that free music drives its business. That's the only
explanation for why they would relitigate issues that have been resolved."

[Then Why Does SBS Relitigate When THEY Lose?]


IM-ING HABITS DIFFER IN U.S., U.K.
Using Instant Messenger at work to flirt with colleagues, complain about
the boss and gossip about co-workers are among the most common IM themes --
at least in the U.K., where 65% of survey respondents say they use IM for
personal purposes during work hours. "If you're leaning forward and typing
away at your machine, who's to know what you're typing about," says Nigel
Hawthorn, whose cybersecurity firm, Blue Coat Systems, conducted a poll of
some 300 firms in the U.K. and the U.S. Half the British respondents
admitted to spicing up their IMs with abusive language; 40% used IM-ing to
conspire with colleagues during conference calls; and nearly a third
confessed to "making sexual advances" via IM. U.S. respondents, meanwhile,
were much more circumspect in their IM habits, with fewer than one in five
using IM to comment on senior management or to flirt. The difference, says
Hawthorn, is probably attributable to the Big Brother syndrome. While
nearly 60% of Brits were pretty sure their bosses couldn't monitor their IM
activities, 71% of U.S. respondents believed -- correctly -- that their IM
messages could be traced back to them. (Reuters 15 Sep 2003)

COMPUTING PRICES ARE WAY TOO HIGH, SAYS MCNEALY
Consumers are paying up to 10 times as much as they should for the
privilege of buying and using computers, according to Sun Microsystems CEO
Scott McNealy, who predicts cheaper prices in the future. "The world has to
be getting a little disappointed in our industry," McNealy told attendees
of the SunNetwork conference. "We are overcharging in our industry by an
order of magnitude," or by up to 10 times. "That cost^E is going to come out
of our industry in the next five to 10 years." The companies most likely to
take a hit are the ones with a vested interest in today's complex computing
environments, such as Microsoft and IBM. Sun's answer to the problem is its
Java Enterprise System for servers and its Java Desktop System, which
offers a Linux-based alternative to Microsoft Windows and Office. Sun hopes
its new products will boost its flagging revenue, which has declined
alarmingly in the last few years. In a demonstration of Sun's new desktop
technology, software executive Jonathan Schwartz showed off a Linux user
interface called "Looking Glass," which treats Windows as 3-D hinged panes
of glass that can be folded back out of the way or made transparent. (CNet

[Moore/More Terabytes]

SERVERS GET PERSONAL
Senior Intel researcher Roy Want has devised a prototype device that the
company's calling a Personal Server -- a matchbox-size PC that can be used
to store personal data and may be accessed by a variety of devices.
"Storage capacity is growing in leaps and bounds," Want told participants
at the Intel Developer Forum. "By 2012 you will be able to carry a device
that could record a lifetime's conversations. It would take about three
terabytes of data to do. To include video, you'd need 97 terabytes, which
is expected to be economically viable at current development rates by
2014." Intel's Personal Server could be controlled by a unit built into a
wristwatch, and would use a wireless link to download prices, timetables
and news from billboards and other public access points. "I would be very
surprised if you don't see devices like this on the market in five years'
time," said Want. (VNUNet 16 Sep 2003)

GOODBYE AOL TIME WARNER (WE HARDLY KNEW YE)
Name change. What was trumpeted a couple of years ago as the merger of the
ages, is still (apparently) the merger of the ages, but with an unmerged
name. AOL Time Warner is taking back its old name, plain ol' Time Warner
(stock symbol TWX), and its Internet division, AOL, will be called, not
unreasonably, AOL). Sources in the company (Time Warner, that is) say that
the corporate name change is not a sign that there will be a sale or
spinoff of the America Online division, nor a sign that the company is
close to settling an ongoing SEC investigation into accounting problems at
AOL. (Washington Post 17 Sep 2003)

ANTI-SPAM LAW WORKING IN SOUTH KOREA
Toughened anti-spam legislation in South Korea is credited with a drop
in that country's incidence of unwanted e-mail. The law was
strengthened in December, raising the limit for monetary damages and
instituting criminal penalties for spammers. The law also forbids
automatic generation of e-mail addresses, harvesting addresses from Web
sites, and circumventing spam blockers with technical measures.
According to data from surveys conducted by the Korea Information
Security Agency, users in March of this year reported that more than 90
percent of commercial e-mail was unsolicited. By July, that number had
fallen to about 70 percent. The survey indicated that in July, each
South Korean user received an average of 41 spam e-mails per day, of
which 35 are considered illegal and 23 are obscene. These numbers
represented decreases of 18 percent, 20 percent, and 27 percent,
respectively, compared to data from March.

PAYING OFF THE SPAMMERS
Founders of San Antonio, Texas-based Global Removal believe that the
way to end spam is to offer spammers an economic incentive not to send
unwanted messages. The company offers a subscription service by which
consumers who pay Global Removal $5 will be removed from the mailing
lists of all of the company's partnering organizations, which include
around 100 spammers and legitimate e-mail marketers alike. Partnering
organizations can earn $1 for each new subscriber they draw to the
service. Tom Jackson, CEO of Global Removal, argues that senders of
commercial e-mail would prefer to know who on their lists is not
interested. "They can make more money for less effort through our
program," he said. Critics of Global Removal's approach said it is
flawed because it does not guarantee effectiveness and has no way to
enforce the agreement. Julian Haight of SpamCop.net compared it to
"curing the disease by killing the patient," and Denise Howell, an
intellectual property lawyer, said it was like "paying protection money
to mob bosses."

RESEARCH SAYS MOVIE PIRACY STARTS WITH INSIDERS
Data from researchers at AT&T Laboratories and the University of
Pennsylvania indicate that more than three-quarters of all movies
available on peer-to-peer networks come from movie-industry leaks. The
finding runs counter to the popular notion that most pirated movies
come from unauthorized home reproduction or from in-cinema taping. The
researchers developed software that examined a number of features of
the electronic files, features that can indicate the source of the
file, such as editing, pre- or post-production, or review copies of the
movie. Many pirated movies appear on peer-to-peer networks before they
are released in theaters, and online trading of movies is estimated to
cost the industry as much as $3 billion a year. Pirated VHS and DVD
copies of movies cost the industry an estimated $30 billion annually.
