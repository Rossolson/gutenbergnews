Subject: August Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
To: "Project Gutenberg mailing list" &lt;gutnberg@listserv.unc.edu&gt;
Date: Wed, 2 Aug 2000 16:29:56 -0500 (CDT)


*This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, August 2, 2001*

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*


This Newsletter has gotten so large that we are breaking in two pieces
as we have done several times before. . .the next portion should go by
August 15th. . .it looks as if we have about 81 new Etexts this month!


With 2775 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.60 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.
*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2600 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts in April

Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by 40 cents???
And given to one hundred million people!?!?!?


There is no end to the great things we can accomplish
if we don't worry about who gets the credit.  - Anon.

Age is a very high price to pay for maturity.

"Only wimps use backup: _real_ men just upload their important stuff
on FTP, and let the rest of the world mirror it ;)" - Linus Torvalds

"It's all well and good for us to lay life down
on the operating table and cut out the bad parts,
but we have to be sure at the same time to keep
life alive. . .By Living It."

"It's all well and good for us to lay life down
on the operating table and cut out the bad parts,
but at the same time some of us have to
keep life alive . . .By Living It."

Dr. Yuri Zhivago to his brother,
General Yevgav Zhivago. . . .

If a free society cannot help the many who are poor,
it cannot save the few who are rich.  John F. Kennedy

"Life is no brief candle to me.  It is a sort of splendid
torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want
to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it
on to future generations."            George Bernard Shaw


"Life is an open book exam,
with no particular time limit."


"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."
(Albert Einstein)

Headline News

I, Michael S. Hart, am now forming my own TWO teams of assistants,
one just for Project Gutenberg work, one for anything else I need
help with. . .probably research, web searches, etc.  Please email
me directly.  For these teams you don't have to be an expert on a
lot of things, I am hoping the law of large numbers will help get
me answers to the questions I will be sending out.


THE EX-CLASSICS WEB SITE

Gutenberg volunteer Donal O' Danachair
kodak_seaside@hotmail.com

has set up this e-books resource at

http://indigo.ie/~odanachd/default.htm

It is dedicated to making available books that were once important and
influential but are now unjustly forgotten. The books will be in readable
HTML with illustrations etc., and will, he hopes, spark interest in these
neglected masterpieces. Samuel Butler's HUDIBRAS is already available, and
the following are in the pipeline.

Gil Blas, by A-R LeSage, Trans. Tobias Smollett
The Poems of Ossian, By MacPherson
The Martyrdom of Man, by Winwood Reade
Knocknagow, by Charles Kickham

We need more proofing than usual this month,
if you would care to run a spellchecker on
any of those from #2799 to #2822,  I would
certainly appreciate it, as I posted all of
those in a huge rush yesterday, and did not
get a chance to do as much as I would like.
Of course, ALL the Etexts really need some
proofreading, so if you care to do any of
the others, that would be great!!!

Rosana Actis &lt;efeijooactis@interlink.com.ar&gt;
Would like to do Argentinian Etexts, please
contact her, and cc:me.

We are forming a Mac Team to help our Mac users with FTP,
hard returns, and the like. . .please email me. . . .
I will have a Mac at this desk now, and should be able to
help more with this.  Thanks to a non-Beatle. . . .

We have a volunteer in Madison whose scanner broke down.
Would you be interested in helping find one to work with
while this one is being replaced? J9mklain@cs.com [Wisc]

We have a volunteer who need help with either
WS_FTP or CuteFTP  Hollis Ramsey &lt;holliser@ev1.net&gt;
Please cc:me so we can write up an FAQ.

Notes from News Scan and Edupage

I will include those in the next portion.




Mac users can download our .txt files in binary mode
to avoid the double spacing cr/lf line ends creates.
Or download the .zip files, which unzip properly for
nearly any operating system they are unzipped for...
