Subject: Anniversary Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
To: "Project Gutenberg mailing list" &lt;gutnberg@listserv.unc.edu&gt;
Date: Wed, 5 Jul 2000 13:41:07 -0500 (CDT)


oThis is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, July 5th, 2000*
  !!!!!!!Yesterday was our 30th Fourth of July on the Internet!!!!!!!
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*
                                                   [More on FTP below]

With 2700 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.70 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.
*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2650 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts in April

Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by 30 cents???


For The Future

We just barely managed to meet our Site Guru's challenge of 50 Etexts
in the past month, coming in at 54 new Etexts and 4 improved editions.
Thus, you may notice that there are more than 40 Etexts labelled "July
2001" as I am hoping we will again meet that challenge next month, and
thus will accept his challenge to permanently make our goal 50/month!
[If you had asked me 10 days ago, I would have said we would need some
big push just to get to 40 new Etexts since the last Newsletter. . . ]

Headline News

*Instant Access to Project Gutenberg Etexts When Posted*

FTP vs HTTP
Please note:
The very moment our Etexts are posted, they are available,
usually via an announcement only for our proofreaders, but
it takes time for them to be indexed and set up for HTTP.

If you are interested in INSTANT access to our Etexts, FTP
is something you should set up on your system, and then it
will be easy for you to download a file literally a second
after it has reached our sites.

This is a VERY good reason to save these Newsletters. . .


Requests For Assistance

We propose to post Bengali books (in Bengali script) soon.
Since OCR-scanning software is apparently not yet available
in Indian languages, initially short books are proposed to
be added by manual data entry.  Volunteers are invited to
contact Mr. Amitananda Das &lt;amitdascal@yahoo.com&gt;, cc:me

Can anyone find a copy of:
The Log of Christopher Columbus
translated by John Boyd Thacher, 1903
We have an Etext, we need a clearable edition.

Short Stories
We have had a policy that unless there are special exceptions,
that we should not post items whose contents are under 25-35K,
and in some instances we have posted collections whose elements
are, indeed, longer than this required size.  We have received
several requests to make these available as individual Etexts,
in the same manner as we made the Shakespeare works available.
Unless anyone has strong objections we will do the same with a
few of our previously released collections, so they can be more
easily downloaded, indexed, found, searched, and researched.

In particular, we have an interest in doing Sherlock Holmes,
since we started Holmes long before such indexing became an issue.
So. . .if we have any volunteers interested. . . .
"Watson, come here, I need you."
[Does this ring a Bell?]
We need a Dr. Watson to index the chronicles of Mr. Holmes.
[See our Etext #221B for the first clew.]


Request for proofing for Long Live the King, by Mary Roberts Rinehart
[This was a VERY tough scan, and I know we missed some of the errors]


We posted our first Welsh Etext, and we need anyone who is fluent in
Welsh and interested in helping do other Welsh eTexts to contact us.
Please email David Price &lt;ccx074@coventry.ac.uk&gt; and cc:me.


Someone named Len wrote me about Guy de Maupassant, etc.
I have not been able to contact him. . .didn't leave a
last name or email address. . .is in Danvers, MA. . . .

We will shortly be releasing a number of Etexts by
Louisa May Alcott.  We need someone to write up a
blurb describing how some of the books fit together
as continuing stories.  This *could* be just a list
of which are sequels, etc.


As a Fellow of the Internet Archive, I am looking for libraries
that might be for sale. . .tens of thousands of books. . . .
Even libraries that might be selling off just portions. . . .


We are revising our largest access site:
sailor.gutenberg.org or 198.76.201.198
If you are an experienced web designer
or indexer, please take a look and let
me know if you are willing to help.


Comments About Our New Files

We are now posting a series of books in Welsh,
the first is listed below.

We have only one more book to go to complete
the Three Musketeers series, by Dumas, Pere,
in English.  Would love to do them in French!

Notes from Edupage and News Scan


ORANGE BUYS CYBERBABE SITE
British wireless operator Orange has purchased the Ananova news Web site
from the U.K.'s Press Association for US$144 million in cash. Ananova is
home to the world's first computer-generated newscaster of the same name --
a hip, virtual "cyberbabe" with aquamarine hair who acts as the "human" face
for the media company's real-time news reporting. Orange CEO Hans Snook says
Ananova is a key component of the company's strategy to develop its own
overall portal platform. (Fox News 5 Jul 2000)

JUSTICE FILES TO BLOCK WORLDCOM-SPRINT MERGER
The U.S. Justice Department has weighed in against the proposed $115-billion
merger of WorldCom and Sprint, spelling almost certain doom for the deal and
signaling that the era of U.S. high-tech mega-mergers is reaching its
limits. Antitrust chief Joel Klein said the merger would have left 80% of
the U.S. long-distance business in the hands of WorldCom and AT&T: "This
merger would reduce the big three to a big two -- too few." WorldCom and
Sprint say they're considering their next move, but have displayed little
appetite for a long, drawn-out litigation process. "The options are to go to
court or walk away," says one person close to the situation. Although the
companies had offered to divest Sprint's long-distance and Internet backbone
businesses as a condition of the merger, they were not prepared to comply
with the Justice Department's latest request for the disposal of all of
Sprint's local operations as well. (Financial Times 28 Jun 2000)

PALM GOES PROPRIETARY IN WIRELESS VENTURE
Palm is joining the scramble for wireless Internet customers in Europe, but
is using its own wireless "Web clipping" technology to reformat text for the
small screen rather than the widely adopted wireless Internet protocol
(WAP). The move pits Palm against European wireless network operators and
mobile phone hardware manufacturers in a battle for the rapidly growing
MEuropean wireless services market. To generate a broader customer base, the
subscription fee, will be offered for free in Europe this summer.

WEBVAN SWALLOWS HOMEGROCER.COM
[If they are not yet even reaching a dozen areas, how come $1.2 billion?]
In a further consolidation of dot-com retailers, Webvan Group is acquiring
rival HomeGrocer.com in a stock deal valued at $1.2 billion. The combined
company, which will operate under the Webvan Group name, will reach a total
of 13 U.S. metropolitan areas by the end of this year, up from nine
currently served by the two companies. (Reuters/TechWeb 26 Jun 2000)

MICROSOFT "BETS THE COMPANY" ON THE INTERNET
Announcing that his company's new strategy will be to think of software as
a service delivered over the Internet rather than as a discrete product
delivered in shrink-wrapped boxes, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said: "You
could say it's a 'bet the company' thing." The new strategic platform will
be called Microsoft.Net (or .Net for short) and will take several years to
implement fully. If the government's anti-trust case doesn't force breakup
of Microsoft before that time, the current division between the Windows
operating system and the rest of the company will no longer exist.
