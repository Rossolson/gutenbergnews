Subject: REVISED!  July Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
To: "Project Gutenberg mailing list" &lt;gutnberg@listserv.unc.edu&gt;
Date: Wed, 19 Jul 2000 11:32:21 -0500 (CDT)


In addition to the notices below. . . .


I need old mono cards and mono/graphics cards. . . .

Do we have anyone who can do RTF for an Etext in Italian. . . .
The Etext is ready, but only in RTF. . . .


*!!! REVISED LISTINGS FOR PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXTS FOR JULY, 2001 !!!*

Several of our copyright clearances did not come in even now, 2 weeks
after the original of the July Newsletter went out, so we have had to
shuffle a few Etext numbers around so we could complete the July 2001
listings and start on the August index. . . .

First is a notice of which Etext numbers were changed to what, then a
complete listing of all 50 Project Gutenberg Etexts for July, 2001.

In the first listing I have marked the changes with ^^^ under them, to
make it easier to spot the changes. . .the main listing is as it would
be in the final index files.


*This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, July 5th, 2000*
  !!!!!!!Yesterday was our 30th Fourth of July on the Internet!!!!!!!
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*


The erroneous copy of this Newsletter contained the following listing:

Jul 2001 Long Odds, by H. Rider Haggard  [H.R. Haggard #17][loddsxxx.xxx]2730
This is our second version [lodds10a.txt and .zip] of Long Odds, also see:
Oct 1999 Long Odds, by H. Rider Haggard  [H. R. Haggard #8][loddsxxx.xxx]1918

Jul 2001 A Tale of Three Lions, by H. Rider[HR Haggard #16][3lionxxx.xxx]2729
Jul 2001 Hunter Quatermain's Story, by H. Rider[Haggard#15][qstryxxx.xxx]2728
Jul 2001 Allan's Wife, by H. Rider Haggard[H.R.Haggard #14][awifexxx.xxx]2727

Jul 2001 Morning Star, by H. Rider Haggard [HR Haggard #13][mstarxxx.xxx]2722


Which inexplicably was missing the entries for #2723, #2524, #2725 and #2726,
which we appeared to have left over, and thus were listed after the 50 Etexts
scheduled for official release in July, 2001.

Now, with the help of John Ockerbloom, we are replacing that listing with the
following. . .which has moved the three misplaced listings to the right place
and moved the Haggard listing to a later number, so as not to interfere in an
independent internal indexing of the Haggard Etexts.

Here is a brief summary of the changes, followed by the entire listings as it
should be filed for future indexing and cataloguing. . . .

The filenames have not changed, so if you retrieve via FTP or other indexings
that use the filename, you don't have to change anything to get the file, but
. . .if you get the new file it will have a new number inside, and in the one
case, will have a new date.

I have underlined the changed portions with ^^ to make them easy to see here,
and they appear normally in the following complete index of the 50 Etexts.
