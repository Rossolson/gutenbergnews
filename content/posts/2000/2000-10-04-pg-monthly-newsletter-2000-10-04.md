Subject: Project Gutenberg October Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
To: "Project Gutenberg mailing list" &lt;gutnberg@listserv.unc.edu&gt;
Date: Wed, 4 Oct 2000 16:29:56 -0500 (CDT)


This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, October 4, 2000

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*

*****WE ARE HOPING TO POST ETEXT #3000 BY NEXT MONTH'S NEWSLETTER*****

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext01
or
ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext01

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.


With 2940 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.40 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.

*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

This "cost" is down from $3.48 when we had 2870 Etexts on September 3
This "cost" is down from $3.55 when we had 2820 Etexts on August 16
This "cost" is down from $3.60 when we had 2775 Etexts on August 2
This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2650 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts in April

Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by 60 cents???
Just from one spring to the next fall???

***

I am sticking my neck out a little here, and setting the bar for
December at 60 Etexts, instead of our official 50. . .so we will
be able to get to #3000 by the end of the year 2000. . . .

So, if you have an Etext in mind to do, NOW would be a great time
to get rolling on it.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation finally got a
few donations in the mail. . .so things are in place and working.

Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in:
Texas, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota,
Iowa, Indiana, and Vermont. As the requirements for other states
are met, additions to this list will be made and fund raising will
begin in the additional states. These donations should be made to
the "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation" and mailed to:

From:  Michael Morris &lt;pg@aims.on.ca&gt;
New Canadian Sabatini Site
ftp://ftp.aims.on.ca/pub/gutenberg/sabatini/
"Our resources are available for any other texts
that are public domain in Canada but not in the U.S."


Requests For Assistance

VOLUNTEER SOUGHT (3-5 hours):
We need to update our list of active FTP mirror sites.
The task is to visit all the sites listed at
http://promo.net/pg/list.html
and determine (a) whether the mirror is currently updated;
(b) an email contact for the site, if available;
and (c) an http:// Web address for the FTP site, if available.
If you have a few hours to spend on this, and understand
approximately what the tasks involve, please contact our
FTP director, Greg Newby: gbnewby@ils.unc.edu


New Distributed Typing and Proofing Site

Charles Franks &lt;Charlz@lvcablemodem.com&gt; has set up an experimental
distributed proofing site at http://charlz.dynip.com/gutenberg

In this site, you can view a page of a book to be produced, and
type in the text, or correct the OCRed version that may be
available, online. We're kicking off with a difficult scan of
Pope's translation of The Odyssey.


Emerson Team Starting Shortly

Nadina Fennell &lt;Geloe36@hotmail.com&gt;
will be starting on Emerson Etexts
next month.  Please contact her if
you are interested.  cc:me


And finally, I, personally, still need some mono-graphics cards.
These are usually Hercules clones. . .something on a very small
card that does graphics on genuine IBM monochrome screens, often
with markings such as MGA or MGP [for Mono-Graphics-Adaptor] or
[for Mono-Graphics Parallel]. . . .  Any small mono card should
do. . .but the full length ones are usually only for VERY! slow
bus speeds.  Thanks so much. . .I am down to my last one, and I
depend on them. . .it's the only way I can sit in front of this
screen for so many hours. . . .



Comments About Our New Files

As requested, we have a placed all the Dumas Celebrate Crimes
in one large file for easier searching.

We have posted our second Etext in Bulgarian.

This month we have a large number of works by Thomas Huxley--
and a few notes about his illustrious progeny.

We have completed the John Galsworthy collection we reserved
space for a few months ago.

We have a couple more Etexts in German.

And a few more by Kipling and Twain.


Comments About Our Improved Files

When we make corrections that only involve a dozen or less changes,
we usually don't release an entirely new version number. . .in this
case there were several times I made less than a dozen corrections
to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, but the sum total of these is
two or three dozen, so you may want to download this one again even
though it has the same file number.  If I had made them all at once
I would have started at new version number, but they all came in at
different times and very recently, so I was somewhat under the gun.

Notes from News Scan

50 MILLION ADULTS AT RISK FOR 'NET ILLITERACY'
As many as 50 million U.S. adults are at risk for becoming functionally
illiterate in the coming years because they're technologically deprived,
according to a Gartner Group study. "The Internet will soon be so pervasive
that not having access to the technology or not knowing how to use it will
be the equivalent of not knowing how to read or write," says Gartner CEO
Michael Fleisher. The report confirms the existence of a "digital divide"
that denies 65% of "lower socioeconomic-status" Americans access to the
Internet, compared with only 17% in the top income bracket. But beyond
simple access, a second "experience gap" separates people knowledgeable
enough to tap the benefits of the Internet from those who are not.
Meanwhile, a third divide is developing between those with high-speed,
broadband access and those stuck with straight dialup accounts. "As
broadband access reaches higher penetration rates, we can expect to see a
gap in broadband adoption that mirrors today's gaps in (personal computer)
ownership. This will be the equivalent of having the moderate and upper
classes in IMAX theaters while the underprivileged are still watching
silent movies," says Fleisher. (Reuters/MSNBC 2 Oct 2000)

SONY'S NEW "AIRBOARD" FOR TV, WEB, AND E-MAIL
Sony, the company that created the Walkman personal stereo, has developed a
slim, light-weight, 10.4-inch device called the Airboard that comes with a
base station and that will allow to watch TV, send e-mail, and surf the Web
from your home or yard. A touch pad on the screen takes the place of a
keyboard. Sony executive Shizuo Takashino says, "There has been nothing
like this in the world," Without using a PC, users can access information
from anywhere, effectively solving the so-called digital-divide problem.'

SENATE HIKES VISAS FOR HIGH-TECH WORKERS
The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of raising the limit on H1B visas,
which enable highly skilled foreigners to enter the U.S. for work. The 96-1
vote was hailed as a victory for the high-tech industry, which has argued
it needs the extra workers to fill some 300,000 jobs now going begging for
lack of skilled applicants. The legislation, which raised the ceiling to
195,000 visas per year for the next three years, now faces a vote in the
House before it goes to President Clinton for signing. (Financial Times 4

TOSHIBA OFFERS A BETTER QUALITY E-READ
Toshiba is hoping to clarify things for the e-book market -- its 7.7-inch
low-temperature polysilicon thin-film transistor LCD screen works with
Microsoft's ClearType display technology and offers readers a crisper
image. The new LCD uses crystallized silicon, which supports much faster
electron flows in transistors than the uncrystallized silicon present in
today's run-of-the-mill LCDs. The result is higher resolution and richer
color -- good news for e-book manufacturers, who are trying to overcome
consumer resistance to change. Despite slow growth, eMarketer predicts
online book sales will expand from $660 million in 1999 to $4.1 billion by
2004. (Fox News 28 Sep 2000)

WHO IS USING THE WIRELESS WEB?
Media Metrix estimates that 7.4 million households in the U.S. now have
wireless devices that can access the Web, but only 200,000 of Sprint PCS
customers have signed up for Web service and only 100,000 of AT&T's
customers have. But in Europe and Asia it's another story; Media Metrix
executive Bruce Ryon says, "The thing about Europe and Asia is that there's
a whole different economic model. In both places it's very expensive to be
wired to the Web. It can cost hundreds of dollars a month. But wireless
access costs only a few dollars a month. Here, I have a Web cell phone that
I'm paying about $70 a month for, and most people can get on the wired
Internet practically for free." Because of its relatively high cost, North
Americans "will not use it for time killing, like people in Europe."

STUDENT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
An Angus Reid Group survey of 10,000 students ages 12 to 24 in sixteen
countries found that the U.S. ranked fifth in terms of percentage of
full-time students who access the Internet at their school or home,
following Sweden, Canada, Taiwan, and the U.K. The following list shows
percentages for full-time and part-time students in each of the countries
surveyed: Sweden (78, 80); Canada (74, 71); Taiwan (63, 45); U.K. (59, 49);
U.S. (59, 68); Netherlands (58, 62); Australia (57, 61); South Korea (37,
47); Mexico (33, 32); Japan (28, 23); Italy (28, 38); Spain (28, 19);
Germany (25, 31); France (25, 21); Brazil (21, 36); and China (13, 9).

SURPRISING DATA ON DIGITAL DIVIDE
U.S. Internet users with an annual income of $21,000 to $33,000
spend up to three more hours online per month than the average
Internet user, according to a Nielsen/NetRatings report. The
report examined Internet statistics during June, finding that the
group spent 11 to 12 hours on the Internet during the month, the
most of any socioeconomic group, while Internet users whose
annual salary falls between $53,000 and $136,000 spent the least
amount of time online. Overall, Internet users averaged nine
hours online during the month. NetRatings analyst Peggy O'Neill
says that Internet users in the $21,000 to $33,000 income group
often work blue-collar jobs and do not have Internet access at
work, which would explain their higher Internet-use rates at
home. O'Neill says the study concludes that a digital divide
does exist, with minority groups lacking representation on the
Web. (New York Times Online, September 25 2000)
