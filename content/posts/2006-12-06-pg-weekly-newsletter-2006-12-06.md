apologies, hopefully I will have this fixed for the next newsletter.

NOTES:

Project Gutenberg Australia total does NOT include PGAu eBooks posted at the
U.S. site: www.gutenberg.org

We have several counting methods, and they often differ by several books
that we have to hunt down by hand to reconcile. There is also some
duplication between these various collections. Volunteers will need to take
these duplications into account.

The totals for the four collections are eBooks that originated as created,
edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and its 50,000
volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with 100,000+ books
contains entire eBook collections from 125+ eLibraries so the production
statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created by the various
teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share the responsibility
of maintaining. The Consortia Center eBooks were and are the responsibility
of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy to forward any suggestions
for correction to those eLibraries, but those eBooks must be edited by the
donating parties, as per their requests.


=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=[ OTHER STATISTICS ]=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=

SNAIL MAIL (DVD & CD)
Over 15 million eBooks have been sent out via snail mail!!!


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS:
9,498 [+44] at Distributed Proofreaders

The Distributed Proofreaders started production in October 2000 and
currently has over 36,000 volunteers.

For more complete DP statistics, visit:
http://www.pgdp.net/c/stats/stats_central.php

NOTE: PGDP mostly included in US eBooks
NOTE: PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders whose total closely matches
      their grand total.


DAILY PREPRINTS
378 [+ 0] at Daily PrePrints

Stats available at: http://preprints.readingroo.ms

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire collections to fully
appear in the PrePrints Section, thus the count sometimes jumps by a large
number when the files are eventually completed and added in. Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move later to other
locations, including the main collection or The Project Gutenberg Consortia
Center, etc. For example, on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks
appeared, and will likely be moved to other collection points later.

The entire process of working out the details just to send them to the
PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section, it still takes a
certain amount of time to collect and put such a large collection online in a
proper manner.


PGCC - PROJECT GUTENBERG CONSORTIA CENTER REPORT
137,142 eBooks at PGCC

The PGCC collection at http://www.gutenberg.cc has doubled in size from the
listings below, but we don't have exactly matching collection sizes yet for a
new breakdown.

There are ~185,000 separate downloadable files, and presuming 45% are
redundant or are required at the level of more than one file per book:

The number of individual eBooks now is about 100,000.

Thus the grand total of eBooks at Project Gutenberg is 21,000+ created by
Project Gutenberg volunteers, and 100,000 donated from over 125 other
eLibraries, to create a downloadable library of 100,000+ eBooks plus 80,000
donated from over 100 other eLibraries, to create a downloadable library of
100,000+ eBooks.

PGCC's current eBook and eDocument Collections listings of 18 collections with
this week's listing as:

THE ONLINE BOOKS PAGE
27,000 eBooks are listed via The Online Books Page

NOTE: 6,400 of these are from PG.

http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/


INTERNET PUBLIC LIBRARY
22,284 entries at IPL

The Internet Public Library (IPL) individual ebook listing was discontinued
some years ago, when David Carter moved on to other responsibilities. There
are no plans to bring it back.

The IPL still has a listing of online text *collections* at
http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended its first incarnation
with about 22,284 entries, which has now been surpassed by the Online Books
Page.
