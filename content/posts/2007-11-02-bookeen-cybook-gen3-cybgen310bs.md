<img title="Cybook Gen3 from Bookeen" src="/images/cybook.jpg" alt="Cybook Gen3 from Bookeen" width="175" height="213" align="left" />The Cybook Gen3 from Bookeen is an ultra-light reading device that uses the E ink® screen technology (<span class="smallfont">VizPlex)</span>, giving a paper-like high contrast appearance that is readable even under direct sunlight. As with all E-Ink devices the battery gives a great number of page turns, though the Cybook is a little better than the [Sony Reader Digital Book (PRS-505)](/20071003/sony-reader-digital-book-prs-505/ "Sony Reader PRS-505"), reaching an impressive 8,000 page turns. The Cybook also reads many different file formats, including the MobiPocket format, and offers access to a wide range of digital documents. In the future the Cybook will also have a firmware upgrade to allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="_blank">EPUB</a> files to be read.

Great news is that unlike the Sony Reader, this is available to both North American and European consumers.
