THE NEWSLETTER TEAM IS BORN!

As I'm sure many of you know, I am stepping down as the editor. I've had a
great time and I am very grateful to Michael and Greg for giving me a chance
to try my own ideas for the newsletter, including starting up the gutenbergnews.org
website. If you're wondering, yes, gutenbergnews.org will stay live and up-to-date.
I will continue on as webmaster.

As my last entry I would like to introduce the new Newsletter Team!

With such a great response to our request for a replacement editor, it was a
natural choice to create a team of editors. The new editors, from both sides
of the pond, are Stacey, Jared and AndraÂž.

You can bet they will be digging up some interesting and diverse news relating
to PG, eBooks and publishing in general. Very likely a few surprises too!


Kindest Regards,

Michael Cook

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
