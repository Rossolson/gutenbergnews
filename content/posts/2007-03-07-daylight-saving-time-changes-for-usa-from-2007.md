Beginning in 2007, Daylight Saving Time is brought forward by 3 or 4 weeks in Spring and extended by one week in the Fall. The schedule for the states of the United States that adopt daylight saving time will be: 2 a.m. on the second Sunday of March. Time will revert to standard time at 2 a.m. on the first Sunday in November.

Daylight Saving Time, for the U.S. and its territories, is NOT observed in Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the state of Arizona (not the Navajo Indian Reservation, which does observe). Navajo Nation participates in the Daylight Saving Time policy, due to its large size and location in three states.

Daylight Saving Time Schedule USA 2007:

  * Start: Second Sunday in March
  * End: First Sunday in November
  * Time: 2 a.m. local time
