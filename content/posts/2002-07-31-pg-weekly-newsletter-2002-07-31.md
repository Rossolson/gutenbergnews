Requests For Assistance:

***

David Widger would like to complete the works of Edward Bulwer Lytton for
Project Gutenberg and has two bookshelves of these books scanned--but he is
running out of steam.  He will mail a printed book and email the raw text
file ready for proofing to anyone who would like to produce one of these
books giving any guidance needed to those who are new to the game.

Many Thanks!

Please Reply to:

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

***

DO YOU LIVE NEAR A MAJOR LIBRARY?

We frequently need to seek physical books to determine their
copyright status and compare them to eBooks we have received.
Usually such books are in English or German, but they are sometimes
in other languages as well (you don't need to know the language,
just compare the book to the eBook).

If you are able to visit a major research library to check out books
(or photograph, photocopy or scan the title & verso pages in the
library), please email hart@pobox.com and gbnewby@ils.unc.edu

We have found that research universities, very large public libraries
(such as San Francisco and Chicago) and the Library of Congress work
best for our needs.  Smaller college and public libraries often don't
have the pre-1923 printed books we need.  So, if you live near such a
library, and can visit one occasionally to perform copyright research,
please do get in touch.

Please join our Research Team by replying to:

Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;

Thanks!!!

Michael

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world, and http://promo.net/pg can
get you to the nearest one.

These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

(This number includes the 84 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)


In the first 30 weeks of the new year, we have produced 1,347 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,639 eTexts online as of July 31th, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.77 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.73 when we had 3664 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.96 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

YALE ACCUSES PRINCETON OF HACKING INTO ADMISSIONS RECORDS
Princeton University has admitted that its admissions personnel hacked into
rival Yale's computer system to check on the applications status of 11
students who also had applied to Princeton. The university has suspended
with pay its associate dean and director of admissions, and a spokeswoman
expressed deep regret "that information provided by students in good faith
to the university was used inappropriately by at least one official in our
admissions office." The perpetrator(s) apparently were easily able to
access the students' records via the publicly available Yale.edu Web site
because they already had the students' passwords -- the names, Social
Security numbers and dates of birth they had provided on their Princeton
applications. The site had been set up with a feature that enabled students
to check on the status of their applications themselves. The founder of one
electronic-rights group noted that while Princeton's actions clearly were
wrong, it was foolish of Yale to rely on Social Security numbers and birth
dates to secure student data. "It's not enough to have a weak Web site and
depend on the good ethical behavior of others not to penetrate it," he
said. "Similarly, it is not adequate to say that just because you found the
weak Web site you should go ahead and penetrate it."

WHAT WAS A DOT-COM LAND GRAB, DADDY?
Cybersquatting is virtually (no pun intended) a thing of the past -- and
cyber "real estate" is definitely losing value. The number of dot-com,
dot-net, and dot-org names has declined by more than 11% in the first five
months of this year, and industry analysts are saying that the dot-com land
grab is over. This is quite a change from those heady days, not so long ago,
when desirable dot-com names could fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars
from companies eager to project just the right image to customers. Now,
already registered as many domain names to protect our trademarks as we
need. We haven't needed to buy any more this year." So what will
cybersquatters do now? One knowledgeable observer of the scene says,
"Speculation is gone. The days of hunting out a real business opportunity
are here." Maybe the cybersquatters will actually get a real job. That would
be nice. (Los Angeles Times 29 Jul 2002)

VIRTUAL REAL ESTATE MARKET SLUMP
The number of Internet addresses ending in .com, .net and .org has declined
nearly 11% since its peak of 30.7 million in September 2001. The trend
means that cybersquatters, who once pounced on popular names like
business.com and wine.com, and then resold them for millions, are now
earning a pittance for their efforts. Domain name resellers report names
such as PopeOnline.net and Sex247.net can be had for just a few hundred
dollars. "The dot-com land grab is done," says a senior research analyst at
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. In addition to a lackluster market, the
Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, which was signed into law in
1999, provides an additional deterrent by mandating fines of up to $100,000
for people convicted of registering Internet names that infringe either a
registered trademark or a person's name. Meanwhile, the market for
addresses with newly available suffixes, such as .us, .name and .info, is
starting to pick up, and domain name registrars say they are encouraged by
signs that some corporations are beginning to carve out addresses that are
specific to foreign countries. "The market's getting smarter, and this
industry needs to reinvent itself," says a marketing VP for BulkRegister.
"Speculation is gone. The days of hunting out a real business opportunity
are here." (Los Angeles Times 29 Jul 2002)

The research firm In-Stat/MDR predicts is predicting that the number of
broadband subscribers worldwide will increase by 50% this year, reaching
about 46 million). That's quite a change from the period 1999 to 2001, when
the growth rate exceeded 100% annually. The company also says that in the
U.S. there were 7.12 million cable modem subscribers at the beginning of
2002, compared with 4.6 million subscribers for DSL; and it predicts that
DSL will take the lead in the U.S. market by 2004. (New York Times 30 Jul

CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR CAR
Automobile onboard "telematics" (voice recognition and other wireless
communication-based aids for the driver) have been used for some time by
companies such as DaimlerChrysler AG, Ford and General Motors, and now IBM
and Honda are linking up so that Honda's 2003 Accord will have a navigation
system integrated with voice recognition and a small touch screen. The
driver touches a button on the steering wheel, then speaks aloud to IBM's
ViaVoice recognition software, which understands speech accents. IBM
executive Raj Desai says, "It's closer to the natural ability to have a
dialogue, rather than just remembering keywords, which is what the
previous-generation systems had." (Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 28 Jul 2002)

HOTMAIL CLEAN-UP POLICY ANGERS USERS
Microsoft's Hotmail system has instituted a new storage policy that limits
the time span for saved mail to 30 days. After that, it's automatically
deleted from a user's Sent file -- an action that has left many users
steaming. Desperate users who've pleaded for their mail back have been told
it's irretrievable, and company officials say they warned users in mid-June
of the change in policy. MSN product manager Parul Shah said users could
avoid the problem by creating special folders and moving important messages
out of the Sent file. The company is hoping the change in policy will
prompt people to sign up for a fee-based version of the service that costs
$19.95 a month for an additional 8MB of storage on top of the 2MB they get
for free. Microsoft says it has more than 110 million Hotmail users, but
that so far fewer than 300,000 have signed up for the extra storage
feature. (CNet News.com 25 Jul 2002)

TEXT MESSAGES COULD REVEAL CAREER APTITUDE
A survey conducted on behalf of Woolworths in the UK indicates that the
style people use to type text messages on their mobile phones reveals
categories that relate to specific vocations. Researchers divided the
messaging styles into four groups -- creatives, jugglers, controllers and
facilitators. Creatives (actors, designers, advertising execs and landscape
gardeners) used the latest text abbreviations and slang, mixed upper and
lower case letters, used customized ring tones and screen settings, and
lost their phones frequently. Jugglers (teachers, office workers and
emergency service personnel) used capital and lower case letters and
punctuation correctly, never lost their phones, and tended to nestle them
between their chin and shoulder while talking, leaving their hands free.
Controllers (military, lawyers and sales reps) favored brief, all-cap
messages, never abbreviated, and tended to have loud ring tones and to
speak loudly on public transportation. Facilitators (nurses, nannies,
personal assistants) always used lower case and peppered their messages
with emoticons like smiley faces. They tended to embellish their phones
with colorful cases and were more likely to set their phones to vibrate in
order not to disturb others. Psychologist Sidney Crown notes that messaging
style is as revealing as handwriting, and suggested it could be used to
written word nowadays, there is some validity in looking to other ways of
determining the type of person they are, particularly with regards to what
kind of job they are likely to be best suited to." (Ananova 26 Jul 2002)

Headlines From Edupage:

BILL COULD ALLOW COPYRIGHT HOLDERS ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL COMPUTERS
A new bill introduced by California Congressman Howard Berman could
give extensive authority to copyright holders to employ technological
means to protect their intellectual property. Observers worry that the
Peer-to-Peer Piracy Prevention Act would allow media companies to
release viruses and other malicious code, though Berman denied that
such measures would be included. Berman said the bill is narrowly drawn
to allow actions such as flooding networks with bogus files or
overwhelming networks with fake requests for particular files. Security
experts said the language of the bill is vague and would open the door
to media companies hacking into individuals' computers and networks.

HOUSE BILL WOULD SHIELD MANY SMALL WEBCASTERS
A new bill introduced by Representatives Jay Inslee, Rick Boucher, and
George Nethercutt would exempt businesses with annual revenues of less
than $6 million from the recently approved music royalty of $.07 per
song, per listener. Webcasters, including many radio stations
affiliated with colleges and universities, had protested the royalties,
saying they would put the stations out of business. The Internet Radio
Fairness Act would shield most stations without connections to larger
companies from those royalties. Since the royalties were approved, many
small stations have stopped streaming music or have significantly
changed their programming to minimize their liability for the
royalties, which begin in October. Supporters of the royalties said the
bill is unfair to recording companies, which they said should be
compensated by all broadcasters, not just large ones.

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS TO CREATE PUBLIC DIGITAL ARCHIVE
The University of Texas at Austin has begun a project to make digital
copies of its resources publicly available on the Internet. The Digital
Knowledge Gateway will include digital images of dinosaur bones, the
university's Gutenberg Bible, and other artifacts. A prototype of the
system is expected next year and will be finalized about a year after
that. The first content to be digitized will be UT's research data,
followed by books, manuscripts, photographs, and other art. The project
will give people easy access to a wide variety of resources, as well as
to items, such as the Gutenberg Bible, that are too valuable to allow
extensive access otherwise.

ACLU FILES SUIT AGAINST DMCA
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit to reverse parts of
the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act as unconstitutional. The suit
asks a federal judge to rule that the DMCA is so sweeping that it
interferes with researchers' ability to evaluate the effectiveness of
Internet filtering software. The ACLU is acting on behalf of Ben
Edelman, a 22-year-old programmer researching Internet filters. Edelman
served as an expert witness in the ACLU filing against library
filtering requirements.

GERMAN COURT DECIDES AGAINST DEEP LINKING
A ruling by Munich's Upper Court determined that using a search engine
to find stories on a newspaper's Web site violates European Union law.
The decision is the latest ruling in a two-year court battle between
German newspaper Mainpost and German search service NewsClub. Mainpost
claims that searching through and linking directly to Mainpost content
flouts the EU "Database Directive," which grants copyright protection
to database creators for selecting and arranging the information in a
database even when they do not hold the copyright on the information.
The law also protects against unfair extraction of items in a database,
specifically downloading or hyperlinking. NewsClub faces more legal
hearings, but without any expectation that the Upper Court decision
will be reversed.

YALE ACCUSES PRINCETON OF HACKING
Yale University told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it found
18 unauthorized log-ins to its prospective-student Web site that were
traced to computers at Princeton, including in the admissions office.
Princeton gained access by looking up students who had applied to both
schools, for whom it had Social Security numbers. Stephen LeMenager,
Princeton's dean of admissions, said that his university was concerned
about the security of online acceptance systems and wanted to check
potential security issues. Yale said Princeton's actions violated
student privacy. The Web site included a notice that only students, not
parents or others, may access the site and warned that Yale would
investigate and act on any unauthorized use.

REGISTRAR'S AUDIT RESULTS IN EXPULSIONS
Florida Memorial College in Miami fired two employees and expelled
three students after a May audit in the registrar's office uncovered
evidence that employees changed students' grades as far back as 1992.
Most changes were made during the spring 2002 semester, however,
according to registrar Lourdes Silva. Initial disciplinary hearings
targeted 12 students who had "major" changes (five or more grades) to
their transcripts. At least 60 others had "minor" changes. College
officials said that they have notified the state attorney's office in
Miami-Dade County and that a criminal investigation is under way.
President Albert E. Smith appointed a committee of seven administrators
to revise security procedures at the registrar's office.

[Earlier Stories Said AOL Made The Incompatibilies Intentionally]
AOL INSTANT MESSENGER WILL NOT WORK WITH RIVALS
America Online has said that making its popular instant messaging
application compatible with rivals' products is too expensive. The
company will instead focus on establishing contracts with other vendors
allowing AOL to operate instant messaging systems for them. AOL and
other providers of instant messaging, including Microsoft and Yahoo,
have said for several years that they support interoperability, which
would allow their systems to work similar to phone lines, across
various providers. AOL conducted a test of interoperability last
summer. Although the test was successful, AOL said implementing the
system and addressing security would incur significant expense. Some
observers criticized AOL for apparently turning its back on
compatibility, saying AOL is choosing instead to guard its large base
of users.
