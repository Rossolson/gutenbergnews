  * **November 14, 2003**: New Web Site. The gutenberg.net domain was moved from promo.net/pg/ to ibiblio.org. This change will allow us to offer new pages and new services. Some of the pages are new, and many are renamed or were not moved. Please use the navigation links on this page, and inform the [webmaster](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Contact_Information "Gutenberg.org Webamster information") if you encounter anomalies or have suggestions.
  * **October 2003**: Project Gutenberg's 10,000th ebook is now online: [The Magna Carta](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10000 "The Magna Carta at Project Gutenberg"). Thanks to everyone who has made this milestone possible!
  * **September 2003**: Visit [Radio Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/audio/ "Computer generated audio at Radio Gutenberg") to hear computer-generated audio of some of Project Gutenberg's public domain eBooks.
  * **August 2003**: Support the Public Domain. The vast majority of Project Gutenberg's content is in the public domain in the United States. Project Gutenberg would like you to consider supporting efforts to restore balance to copyright laws by expanding the public domain. For more information about these efforts, visit [http://eldred.cc](http://eldred.cc/ "Copyright Laws at eldred.cc").
