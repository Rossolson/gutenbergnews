A short while ago I started a poll to see how many PG e-texts people have read. If the votes can be trusted then there are currently over 36%, pretty spiffy thought I, until I heard the latest from Greg Newby.

If you think reading several hundred PG e-texts is quite something then the feat of Al Haines must be even more impressive.

This week Al Haines prepared and submitted his 500th e-book to Project Gutenberg!

<pre>The Books of the New Testament, by Leighton Pullan                       22459
  [This is the 500th e-book prepared by Al Haines for Project Gutenberg!]

On behalf of Project Gutenberg I would like to send our congratulations to Al on this fantastic milestone. I also have a message from Project Gutenberg CEO, Greg Newby;

> Al Haine is a highly valued volunteer who does quality work. His contributions to the Project Gutenberg library are a pleasure to read, and I always look forward to Al's next title. His dedication to free online literature is an inspiration.
