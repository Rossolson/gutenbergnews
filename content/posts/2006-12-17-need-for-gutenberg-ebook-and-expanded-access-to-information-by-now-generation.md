There has always been an appreciation of Boyd E (1980) _**Origins of the Study of Human Growth**_, Child Study Clinic, University of Oregon Health Science Center: most recently cited in a plenary session of the 15th European Anthropology association Congress in Budapest.

This prompted enthusiastic response by colleagues who realize they must have access to the entire book, not just a few photocopied sections or secondary reporting. I tried, in vain to locate copies for several of them. Google listed some but, had to cancel my order for two because they were now unavailable. I am continuing to scour the book sellers. With some of our colleagues, even $65 the original cost is prohibitive. As the originator of the Gutenberg project, you have a more generic appreciation for access to information by the NOW generation than I have with our narrower focus on Human Biology and the Health Professions.

Currently as I write, we are redesigning our website to make our distribution of instruments, publications, software more effective and to involve young colleagues in collations of CompBib, Quote un Quote, Links, and KIP Clubs (Kinanthropometry Independent Publishers, mainly concerned with translations and cooperative on demand publication). <a title="Ross Craft website" href="http://www.rosscraft.ca" target="_blank">www.rosscraft.ca</a>

  1. Can you help get Boyd's mangum opus for ebook access (this would be a huge contribution)
  2. May we list your website to our recommended LINKS and encourage submissions and suggestions by FORs (Friends of Rosscraft)?
  3. How best can we assure ebook access to our publications in the second year of release?

Appreciativeely yours,
