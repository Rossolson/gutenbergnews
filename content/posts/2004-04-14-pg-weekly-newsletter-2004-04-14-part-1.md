Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
an *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

*** Continuing Requests For Assistance:

Project Gutenberg--Canada will be starting up soon.
Please let us know if you would like to volunteer!
Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,
and we have volunteers working on both of these.
We will also be seeking volunteers from others of
the "life +50" countries, as it looks as if the
Australian copyright law is falling victim to the
new "Economic Warfare" being waged by the World
Intellectual Property Organization and various
billionaire copyright holders around the world.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 14 weeks of this year, we have produced 1419 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our FIRST 1419 eBooks!!!

         That's 12 WEEKS as Compared to ~27 YEARS!!!


With 12,326 eBooks online as of April 14, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.81 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.31 when we had 7611 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 12,000 books each costing $.50 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 12,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 12,326 eBooks in 32 Years and 9.25 Months We Averaged
      373 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       31.1 Per Month
        1.02 Per Day

At 1419 eBooks Done In The 091 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
     14.6 Per Day
    102.3 Per Week
    443.3 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.


***Headline News***

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


&gt;From Newsscan:


PROJECT AVALANCHE COULD SNOWBALL
      Project Avalanche is putting a new spin on the coop concept -- rather
than sharing health foods or vacation condos, members share intellectual
property. For $30,000 a year, companies may donate any in-house software to
the Avalanche library and may use, free of charge, any other software in
the library's collection. While the project's still in its fledgling stage,
several big names have lined up as sponsors, including Best Buy, Cargill
and Medtronic. One of the first donations came from Best Buy, which
contributed its AppTalk software -- a piece of so-called plumbing software
that enables programs to communicate with each other. Avalanche founders
Andrew Black and Scott Lien have big plans for their high-tech coop, aimed
primarily at saving members the aggravation of paying thousands or even
millions of dollars to companies like Siebel Systems and Microsoft, whose
bread-and-butter revenue is generated through custom software applications
and licensing arrangements. Black and Lien reason that by harnessing the
combined talent pool of member companies, they will be able to come up with
superior generic products that could benefit all members, allowing them to
save their real time and energy for software projects that generate a
concrete competitive advantage. (Wall Street Journal 12 Apr 2004)

MICROSOFT SETTLES INTERTRUST PATENT LAWSUIT
      Microsoft has settled a lawsuit brought three years ago by InterTrust
Technologies, which alleged that the software giant infringed on its
digital rights management patents. Microsoft will pay $440 million to
InterTrust, which is owned by a joint venture of Sony, Philips Electronics
and investment banking firm Stephens Inc. The announcement comes on the
heels of Microsoft's agreement last week to pay Sun Microsystems $1.6
million to settle an antitrust lawsuit and resolve patent claims. And last
month, Microsoft settled a patent lawsuit filed by AT&T over
voice-recognition technology. Terms of that settlement were not disclosed.

PLAGIARISM SOFTWARE DETECTS NEW MARKET IN CORPORATE WORLD
      Software designed to detect plagiarism is moving from academia, where
it's been used for years to flag phony term papers, to the corporate world.
Newspapers, law firms and even the U.N. Security Council are using the
data-sifting tools to ensure their documents are original works, and
companies such as iParadigm, Glatt Plagiarism Services, MyDropBox and CFL
Software Development have moved quickly to meet the new demand. And while
some businesses have been reluctant to deploy such software, iParadigm
president John Barrie predicts that soon the number of corporate clients
will outstrip academics. "The stakes are 100 times greater. We're not
talking about grades anymore," he says. (AP/Washington Post 6 Apr 2004)

MOBILE PHONES CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF?
      Contrary to popular airline lore, mobile phones don't really
interfere with airline navigation systems. The real reason phones are
banned during flight is that they disrupt mobile networks on the ground as
they zoom from one base-station to the next at 500 miles an hour. But that
problem is about to be solved, thanks to new technology that will prevent
cell phone signals from leaving the airplane cabin. Instead, a laptop-sized
base station, called a "picocell," will emit a network signal that will
enable onboard cell phones to "roam" -- eliminating any interference with
avionics and terrestrial networks. The new technology is the creation of
WirelessCabin, a consortium led by the German Aerospace Center and
including members such as Airbus, Siemens and Ericsson. It is designed for
cell phones using the European-dominant GSM standard and also supports the
popular Wi-Fi protocol. A similar system targeting business jets will be
flight-tested this year, and European and U.S. regulatory bodies are
developing rules to address the use of wireless devices in flight. Airlines
likely will team with wireless carriers or satellite operators to
administer the in-flight mobile calling systems, and may try tying the
service to their frequent flyer programs, offering members lower rates or
flyer miles when they make calls. (The Economist 1 Apr 2004)

TELSTRA BLOCKS PORT 25
Telstra's BigPond service will start closing access to port 25, used
by outgoing SMTP e-mail, on April 13. "Although some businesses use Port 25
to run their own e-mail systems, spammers also use it to send spam
disguised as normal e-mails," Telstra told BigPond subscribers in an
e-mail. The move to block port 25, which has been under consideration for
six months, is just one of a number of anti-spam measures that will be
unveiled "over the next few weeks," according to a Telstra spokesman, who
adds that the measures will include "taking some steps with Telstra Webmail."
Telstra has been criticized for allowing sign-up for its Webmail service
to remain too easy for spammers to abuse with automated sign-up programs.

AUSTRALIAN JUNK E-MAIL LAWS TAKE EFFECT
Hard-core spammers will be the main target when Australia's
communications watchdog begins to enforce anti-spam legislation beginning
this Saturday. While penalties of $1.1 million a day will be reserved for
prolific spammers, most complaints about spamming will be treated with a
simple phone call, according to the Australian Communications Authority.
The ACA's focus will be on compliance, says Anti-Spam team manager Anthony
Wing. "We are really targeting, in the first instance, the hard-core
spammers. As long as people are trying to comply in the first instance, if
we get a complaint it will result in a phone call." Wing says reducing the
amount of spam that hits Australia's borders is a "longer program" that
requires international co-operation. (The Age 6 Apr 2004)

FILM PRICES CUT TO FIGHT PIRACY IN RUSSIA
High rates of DVD and CD piracy in Russia have prompted entertainment
companies to try to fight rampant copyright violations by lowering
prices on legitimate copies of movies and music. Reports indicate that
9 of every 10 DVDs sold in Russia are counterfeit, while 60 percent of
CDs sold there are pirated copies, and some antipiracy groups say the
problem is getting worse. Movies that have not been released on DVD yet
are routinely available in Russian black markets for the equivalent of
about $4 (U.S.), and copies of recently released music CDs can usually
be bought for less than that. Given the level of piracy, U.S. film
companies, including Columbia TriStar and Time Warner, have lowered the
prices for DVDs in an effort to get Russians accustomed to buying legal
copies of movies, "but at a price that most of the population can
afford," according to Vyacheslav Dobychin, general director of Columbia
TriStar's Russian licensee. Movie producers have been strongly opposed
to lowering prices in the United States as a means to discourage
piracy. Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said, "You can never compete on price with a pirate."

SEARCH SITES STOP SHOWING GAMBLING ADS
Search engines Google and Yahoo have announced they will no longer run
advertisements for online casinos, which U.S. officials say violate
American anti-gambling laws. Overture, the Yahoo subsidiary that sells
sponsored links on the site, attributed the decision to the "lack of
clarity" of legal and regulatory implications. MSN, which purchases
advertising links from Overture, confirmed it would also stop running
casino ads as a result of Yahoo's decision. Officials from Google said
the company would end casino ads in all of its markets, whereas Yahoo
will continue to include the ads on its sites outside the United
States. Lycos has also indicated its intention to stop running casino
ads, though a date for such an action has not been announced. Lost
revenue from the ads is not expected to have a significant effect on
the search companies, but some believe the lack of exposure will have
an enormous impact on casinos' ability to reach customers.

More Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media

[I'm working up more information for you on this subject]

I got a little more information on this yesterday, including a
price list that shows the mimimum necessary single piece to do
this costs $10,000, with more powerful variations nearly double.

In addition, there are any number of accessories that may or may
not be required, it's not terribly clear, and these are somewhat
expensive, but not enough to double the price.

I've been researching and reporting on "Stereolithography" or 3-D
printing for about 10 years, and still have very little in the way
of press coverage of a pretty exciting computer application. . .
"printing" actual 3-D objects from your computer.  At our weekly
Geek Lunch yesterday, I was advised that ads for "printers" that
use lasers to "print" on wood, plastic, fabric, paper, glass,
leather, stone, ceramic rubber, etc., have been listed and
advertized in some of the PC magazines since I left on my
speaking tour around four months ago.  One of the cutest
applications I noticed was the making of "popup books" in
which the laser actually cuts the pages so when it sits at
a right angle, something as complex as an architectural
"concept building" can appear in a nice 3-D rendering.
I'm not sure yet if there might not be more work entailed
to make sure the paper/cardboard folded properly.
Any additional information on ANY 3-D printers???
Please email hart@pobox.com.
