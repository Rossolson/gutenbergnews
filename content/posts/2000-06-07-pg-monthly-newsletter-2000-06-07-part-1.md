**This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, June 7, 2001**
[This is such a long Newsletter is is broken into 2 parts, this is #1]
[This Newsletter actually contains over 2 1/2 months worth of Etexts.]

[I put most of the news items in the next part, other than headliners]

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*

A RECORD BREAKING MONTH, WITH OVER 100 NEW OR IMPROVED FILES UPLOADED!
[More below on this, and my apologies if this Newsletter appears to be
cut and pasted a little bit, because it was. . .I have posted a dozen,
or more, Etexts just while I was writing it, and I may not have pasted
everything in the best possible place, or gone back to fill in a quite
perfect transition between paragraphs. . .my apologies. . . .

With 2600 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.85 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.
[100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!]
Last month at 2550 it was $3.92, and now at 2650 it is $3.77. . .it is
amazing how fast we are making progress. . . .

This month our volunteers have really outdone themselves!!! Last month
we managed to post 16 or so of the April, 2001 Etexts, and not only do
we have all of the April Etexts completed. . .AND all the May Etexts!!
We also have over half of the June Etexts already online, which brings
us just about to one year ahead of schedule!!!

Last month we had posted to approximately Etext #2586 and we are up to
#2679 as of this writing. . .that's 93 Etexts in one month!!!!!!!  And
that's not counting the updated postings of 8 more, so 101 new files!*
Twice!!! as many as we were scheduled to do even with our new schedule
of 40 Etext per month.  This has prompted Greg Newby, our Mirror Sites
Guru, to state that we should officially move to a new schedule of 50!

*Actually we have more than 101 new files, as we did one reserved from
March. . .Poems and Tales from Romania is finally online, though it is
will continually be added to, hopefully for many decades to come. . .!

And also the conclusion of The Circus Boys Series, making 102. . . .if
I have been counting correctly, which is unlikely, as I have posted 12
books since I started writing this Newsletter. . . .


THE CHALLENGE FROM GREG NEWBY

As many of you know, Greg put our Etexts on our three main sites while
I was away, and will be doing so again a month from now.  So. . .I was
struck by the coincidence. . .and have accepted his challenge in a way
that is most poetic. . . .

Many of you also know that July 4th is our 30th 4th of July on the Net
. . .completing our 29th year and starting our 30th. . .so I figured a
good way to accept Greg's challenge would be to have HIM post 50 books
between now and the 4th of July.  [Actually the 5th of July, since the
Newsletters go out on the first Wednesday of the month.  And, in order
to help him with this goal, I will work most of June with him, since I
am delaying my next trip to Romania to coincide with the end of a part
of the academic year there [thesis defenses, and all].

So. . .if our volunteers can keep feeding us materials to work with at
this rate, we will officially move our schedule to 50 per month, as of
our 30th 4th of July on the Internet, on an experimental basis.  :-)

Here is a note from Greg, to encourage fulfillment of the challenge:

Haven't been in touch lately??  If you are working on a new etext, but
you have not been contacted with one of Project Gutenberg's Directors,
why not send us a note?  We like to hear from you, even if you are not
done with your etext yet.  This helps us to coordinate volunteers, and
keep track of what new etexts we can expect in the future.

[He even matched my margins, no kidding!]

You can reach him, and our Production Directors, as follows:

John Bickers &lt;jbickers@ihug.co.nz&gt;,
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;,
David Price &lt;ccx074@coventry.ac.uk&gt;,
Sue Asscher &lt;asschers@dingoblue.net.au&gt;

We need some new Directors, Supervisors, or whatever to support our US
volunteers. . .this can take as little or as much time as you like.

***

I should add, for the record, that there ARE some numbers that haven't
been filled. . .approximately 1% of them have been reserved, and a few
have accidentally had the same edition placed in two separate numbers.
All in all, since we never announce the Etexts until a month's are out
there for download, we are about on the scheduled numbers you see, but
I like to be totally honest about how many we have, so I always take a
1% deduction when giving these figures out.

Headline News

Internet Passes 300,000,000 users according to the New York Times,
see Newsscan article below.  This is still only about 10% of the
total number of computers. . .now estimated at over 3,000,000,000.
That means if everyone shared computers, each person could sit alone
at a computer for 12 hours each day. . .or if each computer sat two
people, everyone could be at a computer all the time. . . .  Of course
the computers are concentrated in one area, and the people in another.

CLINTON SEES NET AS CURE FOR WORLD POVERTY
In a speech to a conference in Berlin, President Clinton suggested that the
Internet is a key to improving the economic well-being of the underdeveloped
world: "If you have a printer and a computer in poor village, you don't have
to be able to afford textbooks anymore. It's a far more efficient way for
government to spread universal information" and to provide a way to allow
poor people to market native arts and crafts to increase their income
dramatically. (AP/USA Today 5 Jun 2000)

CYBER PIRATES
A company called Havenco has built what it calls a "data haven" on an
abandoned military platform in the sea, six miles off Britain's coast, in
order to offer communications services to clients who want to avoid
monitoring by governmental authorities. Declaring his small fortress a
sovereign country beyond the reach of British law, Havenco co-founder and
chief executive Sean Hastings, a 32-year-old U.S. citizen, says, "Technology
has made it easier to move information and hide information. Soon it will be
impossible to trace where money is and who has money, and that will
eventually force governments to move away from income taxes and toward
consumption taxes." (New York Times 4 Jun 2000)

STARTUP OFFERS LEGAL ALTERNATIVE TO NAPSTER
Pointera, a Palo Alto-based startup that launches today, says its service is
unique in that it enables portals and users to share files, including
digital music files, legally through a standard Web browser. The service is
conceptually similar to Napster and Gnutella, but rather than copying the
desired files, the user "shares" the file, which remains on the original
computer. "We enable the streaming of media files as opposed to people just
downloading," says CEO Manish Vij. "What this means is you can just hit play
from your hard disk instead of hitting copy. If you're simply playing that's
the same as going to someone's house and watching a movie and is still
covered by fair use under the copyright laws." The Pointera Search Engine
enables portal servers to work directly with individual PCs for
file-sharing. "The real issue here is that the technology essentially moves
beyond MP3," says Gartner Group's Chris Le Tocq. "The Pointera technology is
a business application, which we've never had before. Groups of people can
exchange files and work together... The interesting thing here is that this
an instant process, it allows for peer to peer architecture. This is very
different than the hierarchical architecture found on the Web today."

E-BOOK SALES WILL SNAG 10% OF MARKET IN 2005
According to a study by Andersen Consulting, sales of electronic books will
claim a total of 10% of the book market by 2005, with sales of $2.3 billion.
About one third of those sales, or $700 million worth, will cannibalize
books on paper. The trend will open up book publishing opportunities to more
unknown authors, with online sales of as few as 100 being considered
successful. The cost of creating an e-book runs only a few hundred dollars
or less. (Reuters/TechWeb 1 Jun 2000)
