          MAJOR UPDATE OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG NEWSLETTER STATISTICS

For sometime I've been working through the Newsletter Archives doing a manual
count on ALL the 'posted' listings, then entering the results into a
spreadsheet. I wanted to confirm that all the statistics added up correctly.
There was some inconsistencies but I believe that now it is a much more
accurate week-by-week, year-by-year account.

As a result there will be some differences in the numbers previously recorded
in the newsletters. Therefore I have put together an article to show these
new yearly statistics for each year since 2001.

Notes of interest include;

* 3,042 is the starting figure for 2001 (previously thought to be 3,100)
* Almost all of the DP-EU books have been posted to the PG site. These
  duplicates are now subtracted from the totals. Both overall and unique
  totals will be shown.
* PG U.S. total includes the PG-EU 'non-unique' figures as these are still a
  part of that count.
* REposted total had to be adjusted at the end of 2006 as it was found that a
  number of reposts were not documented in any newsletter listings.

This is neither a fully accurate nor definitive count, but it certainly
brings us another step closer to that goal.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, although
there are some non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-EU only. At the end of
2006 the non-clearable number was 65. This is a first stage count using the
Newsletter Archives as source. Eventually those will be checked against the
gutenberg.org online database.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms

move later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
