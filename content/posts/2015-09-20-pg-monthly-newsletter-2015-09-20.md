* Project Gutenberg eBook #50,000

Project Gutenberg is thrilled to achieve the milestone of eBook
#50,000.  In honor of Project Gutenberg's founder, Michael S. Hart, a
special title was selected.  "John Gutenberg, First Master Printer,
His Acts, and most remarkable Discourses, and his Death" is now
available at www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50000.

Johannes (or John) Gutenberg is best known for introducing mechanical
movable type printing to Europe.  This brought about a revolution in
printing, which was a key event in shaping today's information and
knowlege-based society.

Michael Hart invented the electronic book in 1971, launching what
would become his life's major calling.  He named his effort "Project
Gutenberg," to recognize the impact of Johannes Gutenberg and in
anticipation of electronic books helping to transform society by
bringing cost-free literature to all people.  Free literature, and the
freedom of thought and freedom of expression it fosters, is key to
growth of literacy, opportunity and enlightenment.

You can read more about Michael Hart at
www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart or in this Wikipedia article:
www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart

To join in celebrating the great gift of free literature, please read
a book.  Or share a book.  Or share a whole collection of books.
Michael was proud of all efforts to give books.

On behalf of Michael Hart, and of Project Gutenberg, my huge thanks
and appreciation to all the volunteers who have helped to achieve this
milestone.  I invite you to join Distributed Proofreaders at
www.pgdp.net, to assist in digitizing a future Project Gutenberg
eBook.

This message is granted to the public domain by its author,
Dr. Gregory B. Newby.
