Date: Wed, 6 Dec 2000 12:00:40 -0600 (CST)



Please note, our entries for THIS Newsletter have mostly been indexed!
However, we are still catching up with September, and October, but the
August entries have now been indexed.  We hope to finish all shortly--
then will usually be one month behind on the index since it takes lots
of human time and effort.  [Thanks Alev!!!]

This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, December 6, 2000

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*


Headline News:

          LOTS of GREAT news this month!!!

*****WE POSTED OUR 3,000TH ETEXT SINCE OUR LAST NEWSLETTER*****

Including #3001 and #3002 which are the lyrics and sound files
of our first Top 40 Hit Record, Society's Child, by Janis Ian.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is 501(c)(3)!!!

We posted a new version of "The Jargon File" which is a great aid
to those who want to know what all those geeky terms really mean.

There are at least 71 new listings in this Newsletter, beyond the
listings we reserved in past Newsletters, and we have posted most
of those previously reserved, for a total of nearly 100 listings!


For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02
or
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.


With 3000 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.33 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.

*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*


This "cost" is down from $3.40 when we had 2870 Etexts on October 18/Nov 1
This "cost" is down from $3.48 when we had 2870 Etexts on September 3
This "cost" is down from $3.55 when we had 2820 Etexts on August 16
This "cost" is down from $3.60 when we had 2775 Etexts on August 2
This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2650 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts in April

Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by 66 cents???
Just from one spring to the next fall???

Requests For Assistance

From:  Harvey Wheeler &lt;verulan@mindspring.com&gt;

We need someone to scan and proof these, and then Harvey
can do a major revision to correct many errors that are
in these paper editions.

1.  Author:           Bacon, Francis, 1561-1626
Uniform title:    Novum organum
Title:            Bacon's Novum organum / edited with introduction, notes,
                   etc. by Thomas Fowler.
Publisher:        Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1878.  1889 2nd Ed is better!
Description:      xvi, 619, 36, [6] p. ; 23 cm.             see below
Series:           Clarendon press series
Notes:            Includes bibliographies: (p. 142-151).
Language:         Latin
Subjects:         Science--Methodology--Early works to 1800
                    Induction (Logic)--Early works to 1800

In 1889 Fowler published a 2nd edition of the Latin version of
Novum Organum.

(The date makes it easy to confuse this with the English translation
of the same date, as did the original librarian.)

The only difference is extended and revised notes by Fowler.
They are long and tedious but we've got to check them.
So if we get a volunteer for the Latin version,
this 2nd edition is the one to use.


2.  Author:           Bacon, Francis, 1561-1626
Title:            Bacon's Novum organum; 2d ed.
Publisher:        Oxford, The Clarendon press, 1889.
Description:      xxii p., 1 l., 629 p. 23 cm.
Language:         English
[We may have this one, so ask before you leap]


We have a leader, DAVID WIDGER &lt;widger@cecomet.net&gt;,
for our Twain Team, whose goal is The Complete Works.
David has put together a list of our current holdings
along with the plans to complete all the Twain books
he knows of within the next few months.  If you would
like to help, please email him for the list, and also
please keep an eye out for letters, essays, and other
Twain materials that might not be on our list.

We would also VERY much like to form such Teams for a
number of our other authors to do their Complete Works.

Our collection of Robert Louis Stevenson has been listed
in at least one place as the very best in the world!

We would love to work at the same level on YOUR favorite author!


Comments About Our Improved Files

Please keep sending in those error messages, nothing is
more fun for me than a quick jump into our files to make
improvements. . .eventually we will have editions that
will surpass the finest paper editions in the world.

Index Listings for Improved Files are listed below new ones this month.


Comments About Our New Files

Oh. . .so many files this month. . .of all kinds!!!

Notes from News Scan and Edupage


GLOBAL CHIP SALES HEADED FOR RECORD $200-BILLION
Global chip sales grew 40% in October and are on their way to a record $200
billion for 2000, according to a report by the Semiconductor Industry
Association. The SIA's monthly Global Sales Report tallied October sales at
$18.6 billion, up from $13.4 billion for the same period last year, with
demand driven by consumer electronics, and wired and wireless
communications markets in addition to the PC sector. The largest growth was
in Japan, which increased 47%, followed by the Americas with 41%, the
Asia/Pacific market at 35%, and Europe increasing 33%. This year's glowing
report has a downside, however -- analysts predict that future growth in
chip sales will be more moderate as it will be difficult to significantly
exceed this year's robust sales activity. (Financial Times 5 Dec 2000)

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]



Meanwhile, you can get either the WAV format (which is MUCH MUCH
bigger) or the MP3 format (smaller, sounds the same).

Your Web browser should be able to play either.

Go to http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext02
and scroll to the files starting with 'schil'
The 'schil-README.txt' file says what's in the 4
different audio files (a low and hi-resolution for both WAV
and MP3).

Choose one; click on it.  The file will download (which
might take awhile), then play.  You can also right-click
to save on your hard drive.  Or, go via FTP to

Calling Macintosh users

There's a move afoot to lighten the load on Professor Hart.
It falls to Professor Hart to do the necessary hand-holding when
texts are prepared by Mac-users who haven't much experience of
cross-platform procedures.  We're working on the idea of putting
together a "Mac-users' package", a collection of recommendations
to help Mac-users.

We've identified several useful applications and we've drafted
suggestions for using the relevant features of each application.
Now we want to find out whether there are other goodies worth
recommending, and test whether the suggestions really work.

We won't be doing anything more until after Christmas, but we're
taking the opportunity to get this item into the newsletter.
If you are a Mac-using Gutenberger, and if you'd be willing to
help a little, please email us.  Please let us know which
categories below you fall into.

1.  Experienced Mac-using Gutenbergers who know what procedures
are successful for preparing and transmitting files for Project
Gutenberg.  We'll be starting by asking whether you encode the files
that you upload to the Project Gutenberg server, or the files that
you send to Professor Hart.

2.  Any Mac-using Gutenbergers who would be willing to apply one
process to a standard test file and forward it to Professor Hart for
assessment, or who would be willing to test detailed suggestions for
using a particular program or procedure .

If you can help, please contact Adrienne Forbes at:
&lt;dandaforbes@netmatters.co.uk&gt;.

Someone sent me a list of all the large and small prefixes:
kilo,mega,giga,tera, etc.
milli,micro,nano,femto, etc.
But I can't find it, can you please send it again?

EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A TERABYTE!!!

. . .and a gigabyte of RAM and a gigahertz of CPU chip. . .

AND ALL FOR UNDER $10,000


ANNOUNCING THE TGG SPECIFICATION FOR TERABYTE COMPUTERS

These specifications are to provide a continuous scale
for measuring system performance in the new millennium.
As you know, it specs get pretty ridiculous after just
a few iterations of Moore's Law. . .every PC sold this
year will have Norton's SI ratings in the hundreds, or
even thousands, and gigahertz Landmark Speed ratings--
ratings which are far beyond the measurements programs
like this were originally meant to make. . . .

So, we are proud to announce a specification that will
ride the tides of time, giving the current prices such
systems should cost at any given date, along with what
current performance should be expected from that price
point in the future.

For example:

The 1.0 TGG rating is given to this kind of system:

Date:  January 1, 2000
Cost:  $10,000
Disk:  1.0 Terabytes
RAM:   1.0 Gigabytes
CPU:   1.0 Gigahertz

In 18 months this system as it is listed would have
fallen to a rating of .5, since the cost would be
twice as much as it then should be.

To maintain the 1.0 TGG rating after one period of the
Moore's Law [18 months] the system would have to be:

Date:  July 1, 2001
Cost:  $5,000
Disk:  1.0 Terabytes
RAM:   1.0 Gigabytes
CPU:   1.0 Gigahertz

or you would have to get more disk, RAM and CPU to multiply
to 2.0, if the system were still costing $10,000, such as:

Date:  July 1, 2001
Cost:  $10,000
Disk:  1.26 Terabytes
RAM:   1.26 Gigabytes
CPU:   1.26 Gigahertz

which would yield a TGG rating of 2.0 on January 1, 2000,
but would have dropped to a rating of 1.0 on July 1, 2001

One more iteration should get the point across:

Date:  January 1, 2003
Cost:  $2,500
Disk:  1.0 Terabytes
RAM:   1.0 Gigabytes
CPU:   1.0 Gigahertz

or

Date:  January 1, 2003
Cost:  $10,000
Disk:  1.6 Terabytes
RAM:   1.6 Gigabytes
CPU:   1.6 Gigahertz

which would yield a TGG rating of 4.0 on January 1, 2000,
but would have dropped to a rating of 1.0 on January 1, 2003

We will work up a table for the first 10 iterations.

The Pentium 4 will run at these speeds, and I should have
one this week, but not the one you should buy, this one
takes BusRAM, which is FAR too expensive.  Do any of you
know where I can get some at reasonable prices???!!!???!!!

We are using the initials TGG for this rating system,
which currently have the following two expansions:

The Terabyte Gigabyte Gigahertz Rating System
The Gutenberg Goal Rating System

My personal observations of the current state of the computer revolution:

I have reported every year on how saturated the US and the world are with
computers and with Internet accounts and yet people still find it strange
that we have passed the midpoint in computer saturation in the US, and in
US Internet accounts.

In one month it is likely that there will be twice as many US households
WITH computers as WITHOUT, it is possible this is already true given the
delays in this information reaching the public.

If we divide the US into Early, Middle, and Late households, then we are
now in the process of getting those "Late Adopters" into computers if we
divide the households into equal thirds, which most statisticians refuse
to do, as it would lessen the mystification powers of their statistics.

In the same vein, if we divide US Internet accounts into Early and Late,
we are now filling in the Late Adopters, as there are now 135 million of
these Internet accounts in the US alone, which is about half the numbers
indicated by preliminary reports of the 2000 census.

So in response to those I hear touting themselves as "Internet Pioneers"
as these have only recently announced their new presence on the Internet
. . .I can only say that with half the country there ahead of you, it is
just not possible for you to be in the first half any more. . . .

I won't go into this further other than to say that there have been some
interesting conversations on some listservers in response to some of the
newbies touting themselves as Internet Pioneers. . .and we muleskinners,
such as we are, have decided to light a fire and brand them as settlers.

hee hee

Now for the hard part. . . .  As I predicted last year, there was a nice
big shakeout of many of these dotcom Internet Pioneers this year as only
could have been predicted by the fact that you just can't sell the large
number of computers to an audience that is 2/3 saturated as you can to a
similar audience that is 1/3 saturated. . .we have passed the midzone of
the "S" curve. . .and we will never pass that way again.

So, of course those who didn't really know what they were doing dropping
out of the telegenepool is the most obvious thing to happen.

However, this only means that the strongest have survived, and you don't
need to worry as much about them dropping out next year. . . .

Of course, some of us may not agree that the megazilliondollar takeovers
are the best way to "settle" cyberspace. . .and we are fighting back.

I bought a Sound Blaster AWE 64 GOLD,
and would like a copy of the disk[s]
that come with it.  Can't load the
one that came with mine.  And I need
drivers for it.

I am also need drivers for these:
Matrox Millennium II video card
SoundBlaster Model CT4170
[This one will be hard to find,
you may need to ask someone at
Creative Audio.

Thanks so much!!!  Michael
