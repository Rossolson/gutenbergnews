## A year of anniversaries

July 4 2021 will mark 50 years since Michael Hart's creation of the first eBook, The US Declaration of Independence (<https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1>).

As with essentially all other great inventions, there is a pre-history, as well as important events afterwards. Here's an article that tells part of the broader story:

>   50 years of ebooks – an illustrated history  
>   <https://geekupdated.com/50-years-of-ebooks-illustrated-history/>

Also this year, a less happy anniversary is that Michael Hart died on September 6, 2011 at the age of 64. Project Gutenberg has continued to grow since then, and remains a nexus for digitizing and freely distributing electronic books. The "About" section ofwww.gutenberg.org has more of the story.

Project Gutenberg is possible only through the efforts of volunteers. In 2021, it's sometimes hard to remember days before the Internet made online collaboration possible for so many people - that spirit of collaboration is key to Project Gutenberg's success.

Project Gutenberg has always relied on the effort of volunteers to identify and digitize literature, and to build and support the website and other support infrastructure. Today, Distributed Proofreaders is the source for most of the new eBooks, and DP welcomes your assistance.

There are many different roles for the different steps involved in digitizing a printed book to make a Project Gutenberg eBook. Beginners are welcome, and there is an online tutorial to get started.
