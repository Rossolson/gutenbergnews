## "Crossed out" eBook ad wins CLIO Awards bronze medal

Congratulations to "the community." This is a marketing firm that worked with Project Gutenberg to develop a print campaign that shows visually how much more of a story may be found in a book, than in a movie or similar adaptation of the book.

Their graphic, "Crossed-out classics: A Christmas Carol," won a bronze metal in the CLIO awards. You can find an image of their work here:
>   <https://clios.com/awards/winner/93057>

The image was created by comparing the story elements of the Project Gutenberg eBook with a Christmas Carol movie. The blacked out areas in the image represent parts of the book that are not part of the movie. The message is that by reading the book - which is freely available from Project Gutenberg - you can get much more of the story.

The Web Masters podcast interviewed Greg Newby, CEO of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and long-time Project Gutenberg volunteer. You can find the podcast, transcript, and download links here: <https://share.transistor.fm/s/667f33b9>
