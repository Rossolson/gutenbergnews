## A short history of eBooks in 20 drawings

If you are interested in how Project Gutenberg fits into the history of eBooks, you might enjoy viewing this online eBook:

**A short history of eBooks in 20 drawings**  
<https://archive.org/details/history-ebooks-drawings>

Text by Marie Lebert, and illustrations by Denis Renard. Marie is known to Project Gutenberg as the author of several eBooks on the history of Project Gutenberg. You can find them by searching the catalog at <https://www.gutenberg.org>, or by viewing the "About" page where they are linked.

Marie is also an expert translator, and a scholar of the history of translation.


## Dr. Newby interview on Australian radio

Director and CEO of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (and newsletter editor) was interviewed for a story on Australian radio.

Find the story (an audio recording) here:

**E-booksâ€”winners and losers**  
<https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/e-books%E2%80%94winners-and-losers/13599178>

The story focuses on the impact of eBooks, especially on how shifts in the commercial publisher marketplace have created some challenges for readers and for libraries.


## Join Distributed Proofreaders

Visit <https://www.pgdp.net> to learn about how to help create some of Project Gutenberg's forthcoming eBooks. Proofreading a page a day is easy, fun, and a great way to help bring literature to the world. There are many different roles for the different steps involved in digitizing a printed book to make a Project Gutenberg eBook. Beginners are welcome, and there is an online tutorial to get started.

## New eBook Listings from August 2021

This list is rather long, since I have not sent a newsletter in a few months. Instead, please find the up-to-date listings here:

    https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL   (all Project Gutenberg eBooks)
    https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.2021  (all Project Gutenberg eBooks)

These are text files, viewable in any browser or word processor. Because Project Gutenberg has so many languages and dialects (over 60!), some titles/authors don't appear quite right.
