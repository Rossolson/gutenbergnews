## Richard Burton's Arabian Nights

January saw the posting of the 17th and final volume of Richard Burton's famous Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night -- a "plain and literal translation" of the Arabian Nights. This massive, heavily footnoted series of entertaining but very-adult tales was considered scandalous when originally published. Congratulations to Project Manager, BookBuff, Post-Processor, okrick, and all the many volunteers who worked on this important series of books.
