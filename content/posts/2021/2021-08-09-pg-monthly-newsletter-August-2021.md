## David Widger, 1932-2021

Dr. David Widger was a long-time volunteer with Project Gutenberg. He was one of the earliest members of the production team, and was active from approximately 2000-2020.

As an lifelong learner and lover of books, Dr. Widger was able to contribute greatly to the Project Gutenberg collection. He created new eBooks, often from his own library. As a production team member, he would perform the quality controls and final updates to new eBooks, before they were published by Project Gutenberg.

Dr. Widger also helped develop many of Project Gutenberg's processes. His interests in the works of Mark Twain led him to suggest naming the production team the "Whitewashers," and the name stuck. He trained most of the production team members, and worked with the CEO and others to develop and implement the policies and procedures that Project Gutenberg follows.

During his time with Project Gutenberg, Dr. Widger was involved in creating, updating, or processing over 34,000 eBooks -- over half of the collection!

Project Gutenberg is indebted to Dr. David Widger for his many contributions. The legacy of eBooks he helped to create or improve will continue to benefit humanity, long into the future.

## "Far from the Madding Crowd" updated

Thanks to the work of the Project Gutenberg errata team, a substantial rehabilitation of one of Project Gutenberg's early works has been completed.

You can find the updated eBook of the first edition of Thomas Hardy's "Far from the Madding Crowd," with illustrations, here:
>   <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27>

Here is some of what Wikipedia says about this book:
>   "The novel is set in Thomas Hardy's Wessex in rural southwest England, as had been his earlier 'Under the Greenwood Tree.' It deals in themes of love, honour and betrayal, against a backdrop of the seemingly idyllic, but often harsh, realities of a farming community in Victorian England. It describes the life and relationships of Bathsheba Everdene with her lonely neighbour William Boldwood, the faithful shepherd Gabriel Oak, and the thriftless soldier Sergeant Troy.

>   On publication, critical notices were plentiful and mostly positive. Hardy revised the text extensively for the 1895 edition and made further changes for the 1901 edition.

>   In 2003, the novel was listed at number 48 on the BBC's survey 'The Big Read.'

>   In 2007, the book finished 10th on The Guardian's list of greatest love stories of all time." (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_from_the_Madding_Crowd>)

Previous to these updates, PG's #27 was an eBook consisting of 57 chapters of one paragraph each. There was missing content, transcription errors, and illustrations were not included. That is now fixed, and reading this work will be far easier and more rewarding.

Thanks to the Project Gutenberg errata team for this contribution, and thanks to everyone who helps improve eBooks by submitting errata reports. Guidance on how to report a problem may be found here:
