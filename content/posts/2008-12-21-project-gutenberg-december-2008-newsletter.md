<img class="alignleft" title="Project Gutenberg Logo" src="/images/project-gutenberg-logo.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="100" />Over the last month we officially passed 32,000 original Project Gutenberg eBooks, including all our usual listings and almost 2,500 eBooks at PrePrints. This means the original Project Gutenberg editions now list as many titles as the average U.S. public library.

<pre style="clear: both;">27,475  +   287  112008  PG General Automated Count
 1,723  +     6  111808  PG Australia
   553  +    13  102108  PG Europe
 2,494  +    33  102108  PG PrePrints
   202  +    12  110908  PG Canada  [Estimated]
======
32,447  +   349  by various automated counts and newsletters</pre>

**Notes**
Without counting PrePrints, we are still about 30K, and some of the new .lit collection will not make it under our current rules of addition from PrePrints, and would be deleted from PrePrints without moving to other listings.

The 307 Chinese eBooks in PrePrints will probably go, as a team of our best Chinese workers says they are not worth a lot more time to work on, etc.

There are perhaps 100 eBooks not listed here that are already in circulation from Project Gutenberg.

PG Canada includes English, French, and Italian.

### The times are changing, and we can either lead or follow.

If we don't lead in the field of Chinese eBooks we followâ€“ and we are starting a Project Gutenberg of Chinese, for all who may wish to get in on the ground floor.

Believe it or not, Spanish is listed as the third language, with regard to its use on the entire Internet so that's the next goal, to bring Spanish to out Top 5. Michael also mentions that he will be giving a presentation for a new combination of Internet efforts called Both Americas, in Buenos Aires early next Spring, followed by what I would hope will be a similar conference in France.

### Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!

**FLASH RAM**

I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible. The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the Poqet computer, etc. The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems and these were OEMed by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular in a recognizable fashion because their _snapon_ connectors resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

**POWERPOINT**

We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations. One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.
