Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Third Request!

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the first 46 weeks of this year, we have produced 2,058 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,350 eBooks online as of November 20, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.57 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.43 when we had 4006 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.84 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 6350 eBooks in 31 1/3 Years We Averaged

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

E-BOOK INDUSTRY GETS A BOOST
OverDrive Inc., a leading distributor of electronic books, unveiled a new
service that will enable libraries to offer more than 35,000 titles from
400 publishers for downloading to portable e-book readers. Combined with a
similar move last month by rival Fictionwise Inc., the offering helps
overcome some of the main hurdles for libraries eager to get into the
and permission from publishers. To address those problems, Fictionwise and
OverDrive have adopted new technologies that make it possible to duplicate
digital files a limited number of times. Each copy, in turn, will have a
limited lifespan before it automatically expires. Thus, a library might
purchase three copies of a title and loan it to three patrons for two weeks
at a time. Alternatively, libraries could enable each title to be read 100
times before it expired electronically. Analysts hope that this latest move
will whet the public's appetite for e-books, giving a much-needed boost to
the nascent industry. If successful, the new way of managing digital
content could pioneer the way for libraries to loan other media via the
Internet, including music and movies, although there are still some details
to be worked out. "Each medium has a different business model and a
different culture," so it's going to be a tough battle for libraries to
obtain the rights to lend digital movies and music through the Web, says
Frederick Weingarten, head of technology policy at the American Library
Assn. (Los Angeles Times 20 Nov 2002)

MICROSOFT REVEALS 85% PROFIT MARGIN ON WINDOWS
While most of its other businesses were wallowing in red ink, sales of
Microsoft's Windows operating system were generating 85% profit margins
last quarter, according to an SEC filing made late last week. The
disclosure is sure to infuriate many rivals, who have criticized the
company's recent antitrust settlement with the Justice Department was much
too lax. Among Microsoft's other businesses, its home and entertainment
division, which includes the Xbox console, lost $177 million last quarter;
MSN lost $97 million; the business solutions group lost $68 million; and
the CE/Mobility division lost $33 million. (Financial Times 17 Nov 2002)

COMDEX AT MIDDLE AGE
Comdex, the high-tech trade show that was used in years past to introduce
all the newest wonders, has come closer to earth this year, and is
showcasing many new products noted not for their features but for their
price. An example is Dell's new Axim X5 handheld computer, which, at $199
after discounts and rebates, is much cheaper than other color handhelds.
Industry analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies International predicts,
"Dell is going to have a tremendous impact on this market as it comes in
and flattens prices. This is the kind of thing that will catch on during a
fact of the matter is it's not 1999 anymore. Everyone is looking for the
next great thing that will take off, but we're really in a mature business
now." (San Jose Mercury News 17 Nov 2002)
