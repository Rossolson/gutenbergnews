============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

                    -------------------

As etexts are posted up there are occasional comments and notes that
are worth reading , but don't get recorded. In a bid to make the
newsletter more helpful and interesting (Now there's a challenge -
Ed), I will be including some of these on the usual semi-irregular
basis (i.e. when someone sends to posted with a comment).

Apr 2005 Behind the Bungalow, by EHA                        [bbngxxx.xxx]7953
[Author AKA: Edward Hamilton Aitken]
[Text in bbng10.txt/.zip, XHTML in bbng10h.htm/.zip]

For those wishing to know: a while ago a journalist
from the Calcutta Times emailed us with a list of fifty
books about Indian social life that he'd like to see us
do.  As far as I know this is the first of that list.

It's a comic look at the various relationships that
the English and the native Indians had - of their
misunderstandings of each other and their attempts
at accommodation.  There's a very human side
to EHA which takes some of the edge of the
unpleasantness of "days of empire".

Also, the word Bungalow came from India - at
the time the title would have sounded much stranger
than it does to our ears.

Apr 2005 Twenty-Five Village Sermons, by Charles Kingsley   [vsrmxxx.xxx]7954
[Text in vsrm10.txt/.zip, XHTML in vsrm10h.htm/.zip]

Well, it's twenty-five sermons that the Rev. Charles Kingsley
preached - probably whilst he was rector at Eversley.  This
was early days for Kingsley and one edition has "Charles
Kingsley, Jun." as the author - his father being better known
at that point.  Of course Kingsley went on to be one of the
great Victorians and had a substantial impact on his society.
He's now known for The Water Babies, Westward Ho! etc.
and people tend to have forgotten that he was a clergyman.

Of the sermons there's little to say.  Kingsley is very Church
of England and so there's an all-inclusiveness in his preaching
and a general theme that everything is getting better.

Apr 2005 The Bible, King James, Complete Contents     [#20][bib00xxx.xxx]7999



Note:
Explanation of this production of  "The Project Gutenberg Bible" may be in order.
PG was asked a short while ago to provide all the "Books" of The Bible
in individual files.  This provided an opportunity to correct and
update our edition 12 of the King James version to an edition 13.
Posting of the entire series will be completed by the end of this
month. Each book is available in both plain text and htm. I believe
the htm files will be the most useful as they are each provided with
links to the previous Book, the next Book, and the general index: the
user may start in any book and navigate directly up and down the
entire series.  At the end of the month a single 8mb htm file
including all the Books will be posted for those whose computers have
the speed and capacity to handle it. So the entire Bible in htm may be
accessed quickly by the slowest computer from any of the small
individual htm files or the tiny 25kb Index htm file:

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05/bib0010h.htm

Of course this index file will presently only direct to the first fifteen Books
posted today.  When the entire 66 Books are posted we hope to have a panel of
biblical scholars review the texts for accuracy.

Apr 2005 American Antiquities, J.J. Smith, Series 2 [AA#24][aa24wxxx.xxx]7924
[Full Title: American Historical Antiquities]
[Full Author: John Jay Smith][Includes #7911-7922][22 mb]
[Illustrated HTML, zipped only - aa24w10.zip]

Apr 2005 American Antiquities, J.J. Smith, Series 1 [AA#23][aa23wxxx.xxx]7923
[Full Title: American Historical Antiquities]
[Full Author: John Jay Smith][Includes #7901-7910][22 mb]
[Illustrated HTML, zipped only - aa23w10.zip]

These two full sized books in illustrated html format, complete the American
Antiquities series.  At over 20 mb each they are likely more appropriate for those
with broadband connection (or those with a regular phone line modem and great
patience).

Apr 2005 The slave trade, domestic and foreign, by H. Carey[slvtrxxx.xxx]8000
[Author's Full Name: Henry Charles Carey]
[Subtitle: why it exists, and how it may be extinguished]

This book is a milestone of abolitionism, that is supported on
humanitarian but mainly on economical reasons.

The book has a rich index, that is not included in the present
edition, since it still requires a lot of work. An updated edition
will be posted when it is ready.

3) Notes and Queries

From: Brett Fishburne

The Time Machine, by H.G. Wells

H.G. Wells is a name that rings with respect in the science fiction community.  His first book is a trip into the future of the 29th century.  One wonders, however, if this is really a trip to the future.  The evils found by the time traveller are not the evils of science, but the evils of social policy intended as a reflection of the "current" industrial policy of his age.

To step from the book to the man for a moment, let us consider Herbert G. Wells.  He was born to a modest family in Bromley, Kent in 1866.  His father was a professional athelete as well as a shop keeper.  Wells was a good student and even studied biology under T. H. Huxley, but did not earn a degree.  Wells was twice married (first to his cousin and then to a student in his correspondence school).  While his books were often fantasies, he was a sociologist at heart and even joined the famous Fabian Society (headed by George Bernard Shaw).  While with this society, he fell into their disfavor and eventually left writing a satire novel feature many of the more prominent members.  During both World Wars, Wells was horrified by the events of the time and worked stridently to try to develop and implement world-saving ideas.  Wells died on August 13, 1946 pessimistic about the future of mankind.

In this book, Wells attempts to send a message to the upper class of Victorian English Society.  He warns, through this cautionary tale, of the dangers of not sharing the largess of societal gains more equally across the classes.  Since the disparity between rich and poor has been the downfall of many successful societies, as archeology has shown us, it is well worth paying close attention to what is between the lines in this story of adventure both exciting and fanciful.


                    -------------------

John Gabriël Stedman's Reise naar Surinamen

Currently, DP is processing John Gabriël Stedman's Reise naar Surinamen, the Dutch translation of Narrative of a Five Years Expedition Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam.

The book is a very nice travelogue. Stedman clearly belongs to the school of 'if you notice it, write it down'.

He writes about plants, animals; a snake with a bulbous belly he cuts open to see what it has eaten. He frees a frog, or so the frog thinks, because Stedman ties it to a rope to see if the eating by a snake has any adverse effects.

He writes about the food he tastes, about the bustling life of Paramaribo: a pretty naked native girl he sees is a starting point for a discussion of his views on how differences in skin color came to be. His view is that the native American bronze must be the original human skin color, at which point the translator feels the need to point to other theories that champion the white skin as the original (and handsomer one).

To me, as a child of the 20th century, the book is full of surprises. Almost every medium of the most recent 20 years has prepared me to see racists as people who feel their 'race' is superiour. Stedman does not have this belief, even though he clearly is a racist. He is constantly marvelling about superiour traits in 'negroes' and 'indians'.

The book is also an indictment of maltreating slaves. From what I understand (I have only proofed 70 or so pages so far), Stedman was pro-slavery. To him, that did not mean slaves had to be treated badly. So, ironically enough, his book became an argument for the abolishionists. Even now, William Blake's etchings in the book are well known.

As a travelogue, the book is an exciting read. But it also served as a shocking indictment of the treatment of slaves, and so is an historically important book.

The language of the book may be offensive to some. I hope the original English version will also go through the site.
