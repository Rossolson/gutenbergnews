Requests For Assistance:

For me, we'd like to have one of these, will pay for it plus shipping:

For value for money you can't beat the Franklin eBookMan, out of
production but currently on sale in the US for $30 at Fry's. The eBM is
quirky but lovable and has gradually accumulated a reasonable collection
of software in addition to the standard PDA bits and pieces, including
the MobiPocket Reader. Top-end models have a backlit screen. Ideal for
beginners. The main drawback is the daft protection system which
requires each individual eBM to be separately registered with Franklin
before it can be used - so no in-store demos, and if you lose the
operating system you've got to go online on your own PC to download it
again. It supports MMC cards but not Sdata.

Project Gutenberg--Canada will be starting up soon,

Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

We need a volunteer near Chicago to help feed books to our newest
super-scanner. . .we have a stack of 200 waiting, and just cannot
stay away to feed them in 24/7.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!


Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


We will also have this
new address in Chicago!

Park Ridge, IL 60068


Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:

1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

From: Miranda van de Heijning &lt;m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com&gt;
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

Statistical Review

In the 18 weeks of this year, we have produced 1110 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our FIRST 1110 eBooks!!!

         That's 18 WEEKS as Compared to 26 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 7,853 eBooks online as of May 07, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.27 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.93 when we had 5177 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing $.66 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 7753 eBooks in 31 3/4 Years We Averaged
    244 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]

CYCLES OF VIOLENCE IN THE MUSIC WARS
The record industry's options for fighting illegal music downloads from the
Internet include some that may be illegal, such as attacking personal
Internet connections to slow or halt the downloads, or the use of software
called "freeze" that locks up a computer system for a certain minutes or
hours and risks the loss of data, as well as software called "silence" that
would scan a computer's hard drive for pirated music files and attempt to
delete them, at the risk of deleting legitimate music files as well.
Stanford Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, who specializes in Internet
copyright issues, says: "Some of this stuff is going to be illegal. It
depends on if they are doing a sufficient amount of damage. The law has
ways to deal with copyright infringement. Freezing people's computers is
not within the scope of the copyright laws." (New York Times 3 May 2003)
http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/business/04MUSI.html

[Interesting:  Let's Forget Laws Against Spam, BUT Not Against Music]

SPAM OUT OF CONTROL -- BUT LAW IS NOT THE ANSWER
Eileen Harrington, the director of the Federal Trade Commission's marketing
practices, that the problem of spam (bulk unsolicited e-mail) is "worse
than we imagined. There is consensus that the problem has reached a tipping
point. If there are not immediate improvements implemented across the board
by technologists, service providers and perhaps lawmakers, e-mail is at
risk of being run into the ground.'' Legislators at both federal and state
levels have been busy enacting or proposing new laws, but FTC Commissioner
Orson Swindle remains skeptical: "New laws that are unenforceable for
myriad reasons or that are overtaken by the advances of technology have the
potential to do more harm than good. No single law, no single new
technology, no new initiative, no new meetings are going to solve this
problem alone.'' And John Patrick, chairman of the industry-supported
Global Internet Project, agrees, saying that the only solution to spam is
to block it with new technology. (AP/Atlanta Journal-Constitution 3 May 2003)

[eReturns Up 14%, but eRefunds Up Only 11%. . .Where DID The Money Go?]

ELECTRONIC TAX-FILING GROWS IN POPULARITY
The IRS says that electronic filing by individuals and paid tax preparers
jumped 14% over this time last year, with the biggest increase seen among
those who use used home computers to prepare and send their tax returns
(including the 2.7 million people who used free tax preparation software
provided through the IRS Web site). People also seem to be glad to get
their money back fast (electronically): refunds returned electronically
increased more than 11%. (San Jose Mercury News 2 May 2003)
http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5771569.htm

SPAM HEADING FOR CELL PHONES
The spam that now accounts for as much as three-quarters of total e-mail
volume is heading for a cell phone near you, according to a panel of
telecom experts at a forum on spam held Thursday. Federal law prohibits
most telemarketers from dialing cell phones, but there are no laws
preventing them from sending text messages to addresses like
2025551212@cellphonecarrier.com. Because many text messaging services carry
a per-message charge, the cost to consumers could mount quickly. Text
messaging has yet to catch on in the U.S., and it may never happen if
spammers start exploiting it, said phone-company officials. Wireless spam
is already a problem in Japan, where text messaging has been a popular
feature for years. "As data traffic over wireless networks continues to
grow, so will spam," warned an NTT executive. (Reuters 1 May 2003)

CADET ACCUSED OF RUNNING SEX CLUB
Still dealing with complaints from female cadets about sexual abuse,
the U. S. Air Force Academy said it is now investigating reports of a
"sex club" run by a cadet using his government-issued computer. The
cadet, who has not been named, is said to have organized sex parties
involving dozens of people and posted online pornographic photographs
from those parties. Such activities could constitute misuse of
government equipment and Internet services. A second cadet may also be
under investigation in the incident. The announcement of the
investigation came from Brig. Gen. Johnny Weida, who became commandant
of cadets and acting superintendent last month, after the academy's
four top leaders were removed following the allegations of rape from
about 50 current and former female cadets. Wayne Allard, Senator from
Colorado, expressed support for Weida, saying, "It's clear that the
new academy leadership is taking this very seriously."

GOVERNMENT TACKLES INTERNET-AUCTION FRAUD
The federal government, working with state and local law enforcement
officials, has been cracking down on Internet-auction fraud, which
accounted for 46 percent of complaints filed with the Internet Fraud
Complaint Center last year. Most fraud cases involve buyers paying for
goods that are never delivered, including computers, jewelry, and cars.
Some auction crooks have begun setting up bogus escrow services, which
act as a third party to a transaction, holding the money until goods
have been delivered. Other cases involve identity theft. Criminals
advertise goods for sale using stolen identities. When purchased goods
are not delivered, buyers only have contact information for someone
whose identity was stolen.

STATES OPPOSE FEDERAL SPAM LEGISLATION
Attorneys general from 40 states and the District of Columbia have
raised objections to two recently proposed federal anti-spam laws. The
CAN-SPAM Act and the Reduction in Distribution of Spam Act, said the
states, would result in more spam, not less, because the federal
statutes would overrule state laws, many of which are already more
restrictive than the proposed federal laws. Twenty-seven states have
already enacted anti-spam legislation. Federal lawmakers argue that a
federal anti-spam law is needed to avoid the confusion and difficultly
in enforcing a patchwork of laws that vary from state to state. Robert
Wientzen, president of the Direct Marketing Association, which supports
the CAN-SPAM Act, said, "The Internet is not a place to make a states'
rights argument."

VIRGINIA MAKES FRAUD-BASED SPAM A FELONY
Lawmakers in Virginia this week approved legislation that makes sending
"fraudulent" e-mail a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison
and loss of revenues and assets connected to the e-mail activity.
Fraudulent e-mails are those that deceive consumers, either with bogus
return addresses or that are sent through hijacked servers, masking
their true source. The law applies to spam that is sent either to or
from Virginia. Because the state is home to many of the largest
Internet providers, including America Online, legislators hope the law
will significantly improve the problem of spam. Mark R. Warner, the
governor of Virginia, said that many spammers consider the civil fines
to be "just a cost of doing business" and that he hopes the criminal
penalties will discourage spammers from continuing to send unwanted e-mail.

PROPOSED BOUNTY FOR SPAM WHISTLEBLOWERS
Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) plans to introduce the Restrict
and Eliminate Delivery of Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (REDUCE) Spam
Act to address the growing problem of unsolicited e-mail. REDUCE
differs from recently introduced bills in that it would pay a bounty to
persons who report spammers. Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford University law
professor and cyberlaw author, is so certain that the bounty approach
will help reduce spam that he's betting his job on it. Lessig believes
bounty-based legislation will work "because prosecutors have better
things to do than tracking down spammers." Bounties, however, will make
sending spam too costly. With a reward of 20 percent of the civil fine
levied by the Federal Trade Commission against the spammer or up to $10
per e-mail, those who report spam violations could net thousands of
dollars. To avoid fines, the bill would require spammers to label spam
as "ADV:" or "ADV:ADLT" for adult content, provide a valid opt-out
feature, cease sending e-mail when a person opts out, and refrain from
sending e-mail with deceptive routing information or subject headings.

FEDERAL JUDGE RULES IN FAVOR OF FILE-SHARING SERVICES

AOL, MICROSOFT, AND YAHOO FIGHT SPAM
America Online, Microsoft, and Yahoo have announced a partnership to
fight spam. The three companies are the leading providers of e-mail
accounts, and each has separately developed means to try to identify
and filter spam. Spam continues apace, however, and the companies are
calling for revising the technical specifications for how e-mail works
to add a level of oversight and control that currently does not exist.
E-mail protocols are relatively open, allowing spammers to include
fraudulent return addresses, for example, fairly easily. According to
the three companies, after new standards are put in place to guarantee
the identity of senders, a list could be developed of "approved"
marketers--those who agree to abide by specific rules. Those not on the
list could still send e-mail, but users would have the option of only
accepting mail from those on the approved list.

SENATOR PROPOSES DO-NOT-E-MAIL LIST
In an effort to help combat the ongoing problem of spam, Senator
Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has proposed a federal "do not e-mail" list,
similar to "do not call" lists for phone solicitations. Several states
have lately implemented "do not call" lists, and the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) is working on a federal list. Schumer's proposal
calls for the FTC to establish a similar list for people who do not
want to receive unsolicited e-mails. E-mail marketers would be required
to consult the list and not send messages to any addresses on it. The
proposal mandates that marketers include "ADV" in the subject lines and
a functional mechanism to be removed from future mailings. Violators
would face fines and prison terms. Critics of the "do not e-mail" list
argue that spammers will simply ignore it and that most spammers are
difficult to identify. As a result, they say, legitimate e-mail
marketers would suffer under such a regulation while spam would
continue unabated.

APPLE ENTERS THE ONLINE MUSIC FRAY
Apple Computer's much-talked-about music service is set to debut this
week. For 99 cents per song, users will be allowed to download music,
initially to Macintosh products but later to Windows machines,
reportedly without paying a subscription fee. The service, which was
negotiated by Apple CEO Steve Jobs, is supported by the five leading
record labels, though details are not yet available about exactly what
rights users will have. Ryan Jones of the Yankee Group noted that Apple
has an extremely strong user base and said that the "record industry is
becoming desperate." According to Jones, "The timing is right and it
makes sense for a lot of the players, from the ISPs to the PC
manufacturers, to hop aboard."

FEDERAL JUDGE RULES IN FAVOR OF FILE-SHARING SERVICES
U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Wilson has issued a summary judgment
in favor of Grokster and StreamCast, saying the companies are not
responsible for copyright violations users commit using software
distributed by the companies. (StreamCast distributes the Morpheus
application.) Wilson pointed to a 1984 Supreme Court decision that the
selling of copying equipment does not constitute violating copyright.
He said the companies have no way to control what users do with their
applications. Officials from the Recording Industry Association of
America and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) said they
were disappointed with the ruling and would appeal. Jack Valenti,
president and CEO of the MPAA, noted that the ruling does not legalize
piracy. Groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation support the
ruling, arguing that makers of any technology, including Cisco,
Hewlett-Packard, or Microsoft, should not be held responsible for the
"misuses of the tools they produce."
