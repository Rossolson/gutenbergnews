1) Monthly eBook update

REMINDER: GUTINDEX Has Moved to Five Digits!

As we have recently posted our first eBook with a five digit eBook number
(#10701), we have made an adjustment to the GUTINDEXes to accomodate this
change. Basically, the alignment of eBook numbers less than 10,000 have
been moved one space to the right.  This change is also reflected in the
eBook listings below.

Note:  this listing best viewed with a fixed-width font, such as Courier New
        or similar.

=============================================================================
=           [ Here Are The Updated Listings For This Past Month ]           =
=============================================================================

TOTAL COUNT as of today, 3 Sep 2003:   9,327 (incl. 270 Aus.).

Last month the Total Count was 8,961, including 262 at PG of Australia.
This month we added 364 new (incl. 8 at PG of Australia); however, we had
to remove one posted previously, for a net gain of 363 for the week (details
below).

RESERVED count:   39

A "?" at the beginning of the filename indicates that the eBook is
available in both 7- & 8- bit versions.

=-=-=-=[ CORRECTIONS, REVISIONS AND NEW FORMATS ]=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, xxxxx11.txt, and
    prior to 1998, occasionally a new eBook number.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, xxxxx10a.txt, as
    well as a new eBook number.
