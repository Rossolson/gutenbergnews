DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 44 weeks of this year, we have produced 3482 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3482 eBooks!!!

         That's 44 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With 10,225 eBooks online as of November 5, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.98 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.60 when we had 6267 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing $.62 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 10,225 eBooks in 32 Years and 4.80 Months We Averaged
      311 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       26 Per Month
      .85 Per Day

At 3,486 eBooks Done In The 301 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     11.3 Per Day
     79.3 Per Week
    395.7 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


From Newsscan:

NINE OUT OF TEN KIDS USE COMPUTERS
About 90% of U.S. children ages 5 to 17 use computers and 59% of them use
the Internet, according to two new studies released by the U.S. Department
of Education. The new data also show that 99% of public schools now have
Internet access, up from 35% eight years ago. "Children are often the first
adopters of a lot of technology," says John Bailey, who oversees
educational technology for the federal agency. "^E Students, by and large,
are dominating the Internet population." That's not surprising, given the
rapid penetration of computer technology among U.S. homes, says educational
technology expert Peter Grunwald. "The dramatic increase in younger kids'
use of technology is not disconnected from what's going on with their
parents and their families. Younger kids are likely to have younger
parents, and it is those parents, especially mothers, who have a much
higher comfort level with technology than older parents -- or even younger
parents of five years ago." Almost 75% use the Net for help in school
assignments and more than half use it for e-mail, IM-ing or playing games.
Research shows the digital divide is still evident, however: while almost
two-thirds of white youth aged 5-17 use the Internet, less than half of
black youngsters do, and slightly more than a third of Hispanic young
people log on. (AP 30 Oct 2003)

CALLING ALL GADGETS: RADIOSHACK SEEKS INNOVATIVE INVENTORS
RadioShack recently unveiled its new strategy to carve out a bigger share
of the consumer electronics market -- it hosted 250 electronics developers
at its Fort Worth, Texas, headquarters to offer them its retail network of
7,000 stores, design expertise and access to financing to get new products
to market more quickly. "There are a lot of entrepreneurs who have patents
but no manufacturing capability," says RadioShack chairman and CEO Leonard
H. Roberts. "We want to match entrepreneurs with money, with manufacturing.
That's how we want to be a force in the marketplace." The company plans to
devote space in one of its factories in China to developing new ideas and
will back innovative efforts with its own money. In its first
joint-development agreement, RadioShack is partnering with Mobility
Electronics to design a universal system for recharging batteries for cell
phones, digital cameras, camcorders, MP3 players and other portable
devices. "We're metamorphosing the company to be more of a leader than a
follower," says Andy Berman, VP of new business development. "We've got to
get closer to the technology." (Wall Street Journal 30 Oct 2003)

AMAZON TURNS OVER A NEW LEAF ON BOOK SEARCHES
Amazon says its new "Search Inside the Book" feature does not allow users
to print pages from within books, allaying authors' fears that unscrupulous
readers might use it to print out recipes, hotel recommendations or other
such reference material. Amazon VP Steve Kessel refused to confirm that
Amazon had changed the feature to prevent such abuses, citing security
concerns, but acknowledged that 15 authors had requested their books to be
removed from the Search the Book database. Up until Friday, according to
Authors Guild executive director Paul Aiken, the Search Inside the Book
tool allows users to search the complete text of a book for words or
phrases and print out pages where the phrases appeared. That feature
appears to be disabled, said Aiken, who praised the feature but said "we
just think it needs a little work." (AP 31 Oct 2003)

FCC FINES AT&T FOR VIOLATING DO-NOT-CALL REQUESTS
The Federal Communications Commission is planning to fine AT&T $780,000 for
continuing to make telemarketing calls to consumers who had placed their
numbers on AT&T's own do-not-call list. (This is separate from the national
list, and is maintained by individual companies told by consumers: "Take
this number off your calling list.") FCC Chairman Michael Powell said,
"Today's enforcement action demonstrates our resolve in the fight to protect
consumers from unwanted and intrusive telephone calls. This puts
telemarketers on notice that we will take all measures necessary to protect
consumers who chose to be left alone in their homes." AT&T doesn't believe
there have been as many violations as have been alleged, and says it has
"been cooperating with the FCC over the past several months in investigating
claims that date well back into 2002." (Wall Street Journal 4 Nov 2003)

GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT?
Google, which is now preparing to issue an Initial Public Offering, has
recently been exploring a partnership with Microsoft, after Microsoft made
overtures that included the possibility of a takeover. In its forthcoming
IPO, Google will be selling a 10-15% stake to the public to raise more than

WHITE SPOTS ON POWERBOOK SCREENS
The new 15-inch-screen PowerBooks have unexplained white blotches showing up
on the LCD screens. Some customers say they sent their laptops in for
repair, only to see the spots reappear when the systems came back. A
statement from Apple says: "The new 15-inch PowerBook has been a big hit
with customers since its introduction last month. However, some customers
are reporting the appearance of faint, white spots on their displays after
using the system for a short period of time, and Apple is investigating
these reports right now. Any customers experiencing this problem should
contact AppleCare." (San Jose Mercury News 31 Oct 2003)

[Let's Say There Are 10 Million People Who Subscribe To Verizon This Year.
$100 From Each And Every One Will Go To Pay Off This Advertizing Campaign]

[One Hundred Dollars  x  Ten Million People  =  One Billion Dollars]

THEY WANT YOUR BUSINESS (OR DO YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS?)
The wireless companies are now engaged in one of the most expensive
advertising wars in American business history. Verizon Wireless alone will
be spending nearly $1 billion on advertising this year, and the wireless
industry as a whole has already spent $1.7 billion in just the first half of
this year. What are the wireless companies selling you? Your life. Neve
Savage, marketing and communications VP of AT&T Wireless, has revived AT&T's
famous slogan, "Reach out and touch someone," to inspire the company's new
"Reach Out" campaign; she says, "It's one of the great slogans of all
advertising. There's a huge amount of advertising in this industry, and a
lot of it focuses on rates, rate plans, equipment and so forth, but people
don't buy that. They buy the ability to reach out." Savage thinks that
wireless communication is ultimately "about relationships. Verizon can't
reach out, Cingular can't reach out, T-Mobile can't reach out. It's ownable
by us."... Well, maybe they can't reach out, but they sure can spend money
on advertising. (Washington Post 30 Oct 2003)

FOUR NEW DMCA EXCEPTIONS
Officials at the Library of Congress are required periodically to
review the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The latest review
has led to four new exceptions to the DMCA's prohibition against
circumventing electronic copyright protections. Under the new
exceptions, copyright protections can legally be broken to access lists
of Web sites blocked by Internet filters; computer applications
protected by broken or obsolete copy protections; applications that use
obsolete hardware or formats; and e-books that do not allow
disabled-access tools such as screen readers to function. Many DMCA
critics complained that the new exceptions are fairly narrow and called
again for exceptions that would allow users to break copyright
protections in order to play files on various devices and in other
formats. James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, said that his
office does not have the authority to grant those kinds of exceptions
and that such requests are typically made by individuals who do not
understand copyright law.

[Would Someone Please Graph The Predicted Growth At This Rate?!?!?!?]

MORE DATA, BUT NO LESS PAPER
A study by the University of California at Berkeley shows that during
2002, 5 billion gigabytes of data was generated around the world. That
amount, which is the equivalent of about 800 megabytes per person, is
enough to fill 500,000 U.S. Libraries of Congress. The university
conducted a similar study in 1999, and the new results indicate a 30
percent rise since the first study in the amount of stored information.
The amount of data stored on hard disk drives was up 114 percent from
the earlier study. According to Peter Lyman, a professor at UC
Berkeley, those involved in the 1999 study expected that use of film
and paper would drop as users moved those media into electronic
formats. Although film-based photographs have dropped 9 percent since
1999, paper documents, including books, journals, and others, have
grown by as much as 43 percent. Lyman said that much of the content is
accessed on computers, but users print it out.

U.S. TO USE BIOMETRICS TO SCREEN FOREIGNERS
Beginning early next year, those entering the United States on tourist,
business, or student visas will go through a biometric screening
process designed to improve national security. Asa Hutchinson,
undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security at the Department
of Homeland Security, this week unveiled the equipment to be used in
the new screening procedure, which includes fingerprinting and photo
tools. Visa holders will be screened when they enter the country to
verify they are not on terrorist watch lists, and when they leave the
country to keep a record of whether they have overstayed their visas.
Despite a General Accounting Office report expressing skepticism that
the system can be implemented efficiently and calling it "a very risky
endeavor," Hutchinson said the system will cause few delays and will
provide a strong boost for national security. The system will be
installed at 115 airports and 14 seaports.

MICROSOFT EYES GOOGLE MERGER
Microsoft reportedly approached Google within the past two months about
the possibility of a merger. Google--the leader among search
engines--generates significant ad revenues. Google, for the moment,
appears to have rejected Microsoft's overture, focusing instead on its
recently revealed intentions to pursue an initial public offering
(IPO). Microsoft might still consider a merger after Google goes
public, however, according to one source. Plans for Google's IPO
remain undecided. Google's founders reportedly have considered an
auction-style public offering, avoiding using financial institutions to
underwrite the IPO. Many banks are continuing to bid for the IPO,
however, believing that Google executives will ultimately opt for a
traditional approach.

LEGAL DOWNLOADS OUTPACE CD PURCHASES
A new report from Billboard magazine shows that online music purchases
have surpassed sales of CD singles. According to the report, 7.7
million songs were purchased online since the end of June, compared to
4 million CD singles. Some argued that these numbers are misleading
because relatively few songs are offered as singles on a disc, whereas
around 500,000 songs are available online from legal music services.
Several online music services are working to provide a legal
alternative to illegal file trading taking place over the Internet.
Phil Quartararo of EMI Music said, "Any way we can drive a consumer to
purchase music as opposed to taking music is a win for the industry."
