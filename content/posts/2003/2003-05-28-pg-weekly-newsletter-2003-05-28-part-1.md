you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

We need a volunteer near Chicago to help feed books to our newest
super-scanner. . .we have a stack of 200 waiting, and just cannot
stay awake to feed them in 24/7.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

From: Miranda van de Heijning &lt;m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com&gt;

Statistical Review

In the 21 weeks of this year, we have produced 1332 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our FIRST 1332 eBooks!!!

         That's 21 WEEKS as Compared to 27 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 8,075 eBooks online as of May 21, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.24 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.90 when we had 5266 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing $.66 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 8072 eBooks in ~31.9 years We Averaged
    253 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     21 Per Month
     .7 Per Day

At 1332 eBooks Done In 2003 We Averaged

[Editor's Comments In Brackets]

From Newsscan

UNLIMITED CALLING PLANS ARE THE NEW STANDARD
Leading phone companies AT&T, BellSouth, Qwest, SBC, and Verizon are all
now offering programs that allow their customers in some states to make
unlimited local and national calls at one flat rate, typically for about
$50-60 a month with voicemail and caller ID bundled in. How did this come
about? AT&T spokeswoman Eileen Connolly explains: "It^Rs human nature.
People have less desire to move away from you if you have all their
business." The trend started with wireless plans, which were the first to
"tear down the thinking of distance-depending thinking," in the words of
Forrester researcher Charles Golvin. Will the switch to these new plans
cause consumers to use more and more telecommunications services? Yes, says
market researcher Berge Ayvazian of The Yankee Group: "Usage more than
doubles on unlimited wireless-calling plans, and if broadband is always on,
the Internet is always in use." (New York Times 23 May 2003)
http://partners.nytimes.com/2003/05/23/business/23PHON.html

70 PLAYSTATION 2s + 1 NETWORK SWITCH + LINUX = 1 SUPERCOMPUTER
An increasing trend in computing is the development of ever-faster
computers for the consumer market: Dan Reed of the National Center for
Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois says, "If
you look at the economics of game platforms and the power of computing on
toys, this is a long-term market trend and computing trend. The economics
are just amazing. This is going to drive the next big wave in high-
performance computing." The NCSA has used the Linux operating system and a
Hewlett-Packard network switch to tie together 70 individual game machines
into a single supercomputing system capable of a half-trillion operations
a second. Total cost: about $50,000. Most difficult part of the project:
"It took a lot of time because you have to cut all of these things out of
the plastic packaging," said NCSA senior research scientist Craig Steffen.

EBAY LOSES PATENT-INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT
A federal jury in Virginia has concluded that online auction eBay and its
Half.com unit intentionally infringed on patents belonging to MercExchange.
MercExchange is also seeking an injunction prohibiting eBay from continuing
its current "Buy it now" program, which allows eBay customers to make
fixed-priced purchases rather than participating in auctions. EBay is
asking the judge to reverse the $35-million judgment against it, whereas
MercExchange is saying that the judgment should be tripled, because the
jury's verdict was that the patent infringement was deliberate rather than
accidental. (Bloomberg/New York Times 28 May 2003)

REALNETWORKS ROLLS OUT 79 CENT MUSIC DOWNLOADS
Spurred on by the overnight success of Apple's iTunes Music Store,
RealNetworks has revamped its own online music service to offer single
downloads for 79 cents a track. "We want to draft off the attention they've
gotten before they come out with a Windows service," says RealNetworks
marketing VP Dan Sheeran, referring to Apple's current concentration on the
Macintosh market. RealNetworks' new offering is based on the Rhapsody
service from Listen.com, which RealNetworks agreed to acquire last month.
The company also owns a 40% share of MusicNet, the online music venture it
launched with EMI Group and AOL Time Warner, but has said it will no longer
promote that service and instead will be competing vigorously for MusicNet
customers. (Wall Street Journal 28 May 2003)

GERMAN SOFTWARE GROUP THREATENS SCO OVER LINUX
German software alliance Linuxtag, which backs the Linux operating system,
has issued an ultimatum to SCO Group: prove your claims that Linux
infringes on your Unix technology patents by May 30 or we'll see you in
court. "SCO is massively unsettling our members and the companies that are
potential exhibitors at the fair with those claims," says a Linuxtag
spokesman. "It they don't stop that, or present proof for the intellectual
property rights they are claiming, we are going to apply for a preliminary
injunction at the court on Friday." SCO's German unit says it's received
Linuxtag's motion and is considering whether to respond before SCO's case
against IBM, a major Linux promoter, goes to court. Some of Germany's
largest companies, including Siemens AG, the Deutsche Bundesbahn and
Volkswagen, have received letter from SCO notifying them their use of Linux
may be in violation of its rights. (Reuters 28 May 2003)

THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO FIGHT SPAM
The president of Brightmail (a company that helps Internet providers block
spam) predicts that by the end of this year half of all e-mail will be spam
messages, and says that spam costs U.S. businesses $10 billion a year in
lost productivity. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has called for
international organizations to join the anti-spam effort, and Sen. Charles
Schumer (D,NY) says: "As soon as we tighten up our laws here and institute
vigorous enforcement, those who want to violate our laws move abroad. A
global agreement will ensure that anti-spam standards protecting American
computers are enforceable both here and abroad." (AP/San Jose Mercury News

STUDY SHOWS SPAM PAYS
While the battle against spam intensifies, the Direct Marketing Association
has just released figures showing that commercial e-mail advertisements
generated more than $7 billion in sales last year. The DMA's study is
intended to bolster its claim that commercial e-mail plays a significant
role in the U.S. economy. According to the report, about 36% of e-mail
users, or 21% of all adult Americans, have purchased a product or service
as the result of receiving commercial e-mail over the past year, with
purchases valued at an average of $168. About 9% of these e-mail users said
they made their purchases as the result of unsolicited commercial e-mail.

BERNERS-LEE SAYS NEW POLICY WILL KEEP THE WEB FREE
Touting the recently announced W3C Patent Policy, Web creator Tim
Berners-Lee told participants at the 12th International World Wide Web
Conference that in order for the Web to flourish, it must remain open,
nonproprietary, innovative, free and inclusive. The W3C Patent Policy,
which is aimed at reducing the threat of patents blocking future Web
infrastructure developments, is designed to discourage revenue-generating
strategies that "work by forcing standards-compliant applications to pay
licensing fees." While the policy necessarily involved choices that could be
perceived as threatening certain business models, I believe that this
policy is the right one, from a revenue perspective, for all who seek to
contribute to the development of the Web and who ultimately seek to profit
from its growth. However, it does not preclude licensing activity for all
technologies on the Web. Indeed, by supporting the continued growth of the
underlying Web infrastructure and by growing the overall market for the
Web, this policy increases the opportunity for financial gain (including
patent licenses) on applications that depend upon the Web."

EX-STUDENT FINED MORE THAN $500,000 FOR STOCK FRAUD ON NET
Former UCLA student Refael Shaoulian has been ordered by a federal judge to
pay $534,000 in fines for using university computers and false identities
to post intentionally incorrect about stocks so that he could profit from
the buying and selling sprees he caused. The civil suit was brought by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. (APOnline/USA Today 22 May 2003)

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS PUSH FOR STRICTER LIMITS ON SPAM
The California State Senate this week approved legislation that would
create an "opt-in" requirement for e-mail marketers. If passed, the law
would require an e-mail marketer to obtain approval to send promotional
messages unless it already has a relationship with the recipient. The
state currently has an "opt-out" law on the books, which requires
e-mailers to stop sending messages if users so request. The current law
also requires that "ADV" be included in the subject line for
promotional e-mails. State Sen. Debra Bowen, who had introduced the
existing law, said she proposed the opt-in bill because the opt-out
bill has done little to stem the onslaught of spam. The opt-in measure,
which now goes to the California Assembly, carries a per-message fine
of $500, which can be tripled by a judge if the action is deemed to be
in willful and knowing violation of the law.

PENTAGON TRIES TO CALM FEARS ABOUT DATA-MINING PROGRAM
This week the Pentagon continued recent efforts to address negative
public reaction to its data-mining project. The Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, which oversees the project, submitted a
report to Congress about some of the details of the project, which the
report said remains in very early stages of development. According to
the report, "safeguarding the privacy and civil liberties of Americans
is a bedrock principle." The report also pointed out that the
project's name has been changed from Total Information Awareness to
Terrorism Information Awareness. Opponents generally were not swayed by
the report. Lee Tien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation said, "After
more than a hundred pages, you don't know anything more about whether
TIA will work or whether your civil liberties will be safe against it."
Lori Waters of the Eagle Forum, a conservative political organization,
said the TIA is based on the idea that "anybody is guilty until proven
innocent in America."

[Doesn't Play Well With Others]
DHS STILL NOT SHARING WELL
Tom Ridge, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), told
Congress this week that the agency continues to have difficulty
exchanging information with other agencies. After the September 11
attacks, questions were raised about why the CIA did not share its
watch list, which included two of the hijackers, and why a report from
an FBI field agent about non-citizens taking flying lessons was also
not shared. Ridge told members of the House Select Committee on
Homeland Security that DHS has not worked out technical issues for
sharing information or resolved who should be on a watch list. Rep. Jim
Turner (D-Tex.) had harsh words for Ridge and DHS's performance so
far. Turner said DHS was created to "connect the dots" of intelligence
but that he was unconvinced that the department was effectively doing this.

ACADEMIC SUPPORT FOR VERIZON
In its ongoing struggle to protect the identity of some of its users,
Verizon Communications has won support from academic-library and other
academic groups. The Recording Industry Association of America has
subpoenaed Verizon to reveal the identities of suspected music pirates,
citing a provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Many in the
academic community worry about the repercussions if the subpoena is
upheld. If it is, they fear the recording industry could make similar
demands for the identities of students thought to be using campus
networks for illegally trading files. Supporters of Verizon in the case
object to the fact that the law allows subpoenas to be issued without
judicial review and without proof that the individual being sought is
guilty of the allegation.

WEB GROUP ACCEPTS PATENT POLICY
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has finally accepted a policy for
the contentious issue of patents and royalties for them. The W3C has
long maintained that its development of Web standards and
recommendations should not include royalty payments for patented
components of those standards. Under the terms of the new policy, those
involved in developing standards must disclose information about
possible patents included, and those who review recommendation drafts
must be similarly forthcoming. The policy does include a provision,
however, to include patented content in Web standards in special
circumstances. The new policy, according to W3C Director Tim
Berners-Lee, gives the group a clear road "to successfully develop
royalty-free Web standards in the current patent environment."
