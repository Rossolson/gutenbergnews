Editorial

Hello,

Right, where is it? Who's got my Kool and the Gang CD? Ah! Here it
is. Turn it up to 11 please. That's it. And...

"Celebrate good times, come on"

You'll have to provide your own music I'm afraid, and I hope your
singing is better then mine. Here we are at December 10th and just
look at what we have achieved. So it's time to have some fun, let your
hair down (I'm assuming you have hair*) and relax.

There are various get-togethers planned for both PGers and DPers
alike, see below for more details. If you can't get to one of those
then maybe like me you'll be logging on to DP instead for a cyber
get-together

One essential thing to help you celebrate is Joel Erickson's latest
creation. Joel has been working on music files for a while now and has
this week submitted the Project Gutenberg Fanfare! Dedicated to 'the
public domain and PG's 10,000 book achievement'. Joel's fanfare will
be posted live during events this week and I'm sure you'll agree this
is a marvellous way to celebrate.



* Please don't mail us to let us know, we are quite satisfied with
  ignorance on this particular point.

Happy reading,

Alice

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

      If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
      the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
      following:

      1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
      	http://gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
      which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
      http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

      2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
      working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
      years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
      for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
      progress" list:
	      http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

      3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
      date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
      submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
      blank) to:
      	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

      You'll hear back within a few days.



2) News and Comment

INVENTOR OF THE EBOOK SPEAKS IN BAY AREA DEC 10-11

In 1971, Michael S. Hart invented the eBook by typing the United
States Declaration of Independence on a mainframe computer.  This was
the start of Project Gutenberg, an ambitious effort to create a free
public library of 10,000 electronic books or eBooks.

In October 2003, Project Gutenberg added the 10,000th eBook to it's
collection, The Magna Carta.  Not content to rest, Hart announced a
new goal: "We want to grow the collection to one million free eBooks,
and distribute them to one billion people, for a total of one
quadrillion eBooks to be given away by the end of the year 2015."

Prof. Hart will give two presentations in the San Francisco area this
week, outlining his plans for the future, as well as reflecting on the
past and present state of eBooks.  Both will feature CDs and DVDs with
thousands of eBooks, free for duplication or redistribution.

- Wednesday December 10 7:00 pm at the Golden Gate Club in the
Presidio of San Francisco.

- Thursday December 11 7:00 pm at the Berkeley Public Library.

Both talks are free, and open to the public and members of the press.
Prof. Hart will also be taping television appearances, and
participating in a Project Gutenberg capacity building conference
hosted at the Internet Archive over the weekend.

Prof. Hart will discuss his invention of the eBook, and explain why he
does not believe that simple scans or raw OCR (optical character
recognition) output are true eBooks.  He will explain advantages of
eBooks over paper books, and show how a rich and vibrant public domain
is the best possible path to creating greater opportunities for
literacy.


ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's mission is to break down the bars of ignorance and
illiteracy, by creating and distributing free eBooks.  During 2003,
an average of over 80 new eBooks per week have been created, with
the help of thousands of volunteers from around the world.

The collection includes dozens of file formats, and 21 different
languages, with over 46,000 files in 110 gigabytes.  Project Gutenberg
seeks to include all of the world's great literature, in all
languages.  Volunteers choose books that interest them, and work to
turn books into eBooks by scanning or typing, then proofreading and
preparing the final eBook.  Nearly all Project Gutenberg eBooks are
available in plain text format, in addition to any others, to insure
their usability for future generations.


ABOUT THE PROJECT GUTENBERG LITERARY ARCHIVE FOUNDATION

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (PGLAF) was formed
in 2000 to operate as the legal entity supporting Project Gutenberg.
PGLAF receives donations, employs Prof. Hart and part-time office
staff, and maintains organizational records.  Dr. Gregory Newby
volunteers as PGLAF's CEO.

"We are pleased to host our first capacity building conference, and
excited about Michael Hart's presentations in the San Francisco area.
As Project Gutenberg embarks on the next phase in its creation of free
eBooks, we will work to support a growing volunteer base, more
partnerships, and a broader range of literary works," said Dr. Newby.

PGLAF is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation.


FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:

Email inquiries to "press@pglaf.org".  Prof. Hart will be available
for telephone interviews and personal appearances while in San
Francisco.  From there, he will be visiting Hawaii, then Europe in
February for scheduled presentations to UNESCO and other EU bodies, to
encourage placing national literatures online and resisting copyright
extension.

Reach the PGLAF business office at (801) 596 1887.

300 etexts for Project Gutenberg of Australia

Only a few months after reporting the passing of 200 etexts, PGOZ has
cracked 300 with the posting recently of 'Jeremy at Crale' by Hugh
Walpole. In the preface Walpole explains that the book is the authors'
attempt at a school-story.Indeed, a quotation from Tom Brown's
Schooldays appears just above this sentence. The author states that he
is trying to tell the truth about a boys' school-days and is not
attempting sentimentality. You can find the book through the Project
Gutenberg of Australia website. http://www.gutenberg.net.au




As mentioned in this weeks ebook listing (part 3)

The Life of Lord Byron, by John Galt -  10421
[Link: http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/4/2/10421 ]
[Files: 10421.txt; 10421.zip; 10421-h.htm; 10421-h.zip ]

For those wishing to know: Scottish author John Galt (wrote Annals of the
Parish etc) met and became friends with Byron.  This biography, whilst dealing
with the key events in Byron's life, aims more to paint a picture of the
development of Byron's mind.



Scientific Essays and Lectures, by Charles Kingsley 10427
  [Link: http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/4/2/10427 ]
  [Files: 10427.txt; 10427.zip; 10427-h.htm; 10427-h.zip ]

For those wishing to know: a few odds and ends essays and lectures by Rev.
Charles Kingsley on science.  He was very keen on geology and natural history
generally and almost all of the essays cover these areas.

For the terminally keen: I'm using a "Collected Works" edition for this and
most of the other Kingsley ones I've done.  This one, in the Collected Works,
also contained "Town Geology" - which was a separate book by Kingsley but
which, to pad this particular volume, Macmillan included in the Scientific
Essays volume.  I've released "Town Geology" separately (because anyone
following a bibliography will expect to see it as such).  I've not re-included
it in this eBook but have put an explanatory footnote in the book to explain
this.

With thanks to David Widger

Distributed Proofreaders Update for December 10, 2003


Can you hear that sound?  That ticking getting louder and louder as
the year winds down.  There are less than 500 hours now until 2004.
Last week we got away with ignoring it, but now we must own up to
the fact that December is here and well under way.  Tradition holds
that most business and productive interests slow down to a crawl in
the last few weeks of the year.  If you read this column often
enough than you likely know that I am about to tell you how that
old chestnut has been turned up on its head at PG/DP.  Sure enough!
If you dropped by on Halloween then you know how much we all love a
good party.  Well the one sparking up now is set to go on straight
through to New Year's eve.

If you imagine this week's column as a herald of what's to come,
then you will be right in step with the parade.  The theme of
December was set as celebrations right from the start.  This was no
whimsical choice but rather a nice, bright high lighter stroked
beneath the tail of the year. The choice was made so that we all
remind each other through these final weeks of what 2003 has meant
for Distributed Proofreaders and Project Gutenberg.

In the midst of the perpetual flow of new book projects we may have
lost the vibrancy of what it was like when PG reached the 10,000th
title.  Today we can remind ourselves of the significance of that
great milestone.  December was the original deadline set by Michael
Hart for achieving that objective.  While it may seem a 'sure thing'
in retrospect, there are many reading this newsletter who will tell
you it was far from sure as late as mid Summer.  To have reached the
10K goal two months early would be justification enough for wrapping
up this year with a series of celebrations.

Through the next three issues we will feature all the highlights of
this past year, the challenges surmounted, obstacles resolved and
the many little glories won.  For those of us at the newsletter it
is important that we do this because it serves the very aim of the
publication.  Each week we put our shoulders to the wheel so that
the far flung many who make PG/DP work can get a little taste of
objectivity.  If we hit it right then we all regain a sense of the
'why we do' what we do for these projects.

This has been a successful and creatively productive year for us all.
Let us keep a little closer together in these closing weeks of 2003
and remind each other of what we have accomplished together through
belief and dedicated, collective efforts.  In many ways we are in a
well primed position to realize some long-held dreams within 2004.
Share some time with us over the next few Wednesdays and together we
will begin that year with a spirit of unified strength; proud of
where we have come so far; expectantly confident of where we are yet
to go together.

For now,

Thierry Alberto



Thank You's to Project Gutenberg


Here are some of the thank you notes we have received in the past few months:

Nice work done on the Project Gutenberg eLibrary.

Gutenberg has GOT to be one of my most favorite sites in the world.
Ellen B Cutler

I sat one Saturday and read the whole Little Prince online. I was
crying so much by the end of it that my keyboard was all sloppy.
The last time I read it was in French class in high school.  Too hard,
the meaning just didn't come through like it does in the translation.


I think your service is the greatest thing on the net.
From: Allen Kleiman


My name is Pavel Shcherbakov, Moscow, Russia. My 12 years old daughter studies
English in the college; specifically, at present they are involved in the
studies of history and literature of Scotland. From my child years I remember a
nice ballad which was available in Russian translation under the title "Heather
Honey." I thought the original author was R.Burns, but could not find anything
in my home library. Today, with Internet, I tried and dragged both russian
translation and the original ballad "Heather Ale" by R.L.Stevenson, the latter
--- from the PG website, which is really impressive!


I am an artist and writer from St. Petersburg, Russia.
Thank you for the great project.
It is really wonderful, a gift for my heart.
I have found many important texts which I need.
It is real freedom that is so important for my spiritual world.
Your project is really a wonderful project.
Iam sure it helps plenty of people all over the world.


I want to thank you for creating this site.  It is fantastic!

Thank you for your noble efforts.
Dido (Mr. Candido Miranda)

meethu kurian
Please convey my regards to all the staff and volunteers at Gutenberg.

Having the opportunity to read Benjamin Franklin's autobiography is a
blessing.  I only want to thank the people who have made this text available.
His works will benefit anyone looking for the answers to life, liberty and
freedom in the United States. Please pass on to those that made it possible.

Just a word of congratulation and encouragement on PG and all its works.
Wonderful stuff so keep it coming.   Roger Thurman, The Netherlands.


Please let me add my own. . . .

Thanks!!!!!!!


Michael



Radio Gutenberg Update

channel 1 - Sherlock Holmes "The Sign of Four"
channel 2 - Robert Sheckley's "Bad Medicine"

Both are high quality live readings from the collection.

Testing of Radio Gutenberg audio books on demand is currently taking
place. After giving it a test run this week your newsletter editor is
rather impressed with the speed of service and the accuracy of
reading. I am looking forward to catching up on a lot of books when
the audio on demand service comes into full operation.


Improved Service

In a bid to make the newsletter more helpful to readers who may be
using screen reading software. We are able to offer the booklisting in
a different format to make your life a little easier. An example of
the changed listing is given below. If you would like either a daily
or weekly version of this list please email news@pglaf.org, and state
which version you require.

3) Notes and Queries, Reviews and Features

Newsletter Cookery Club

Greetings again. Did anyone try one of those recipes from Simple
Italian Cookery? I tried the Chestnuts "Alla Lucifero." This was the
first time I ever deliberately set food on fire as part of the recipe
(we won't talk about those other times when I did it by
accident). Such a pretty blue flame. The taste was interesting, but I
think I prefer the traditional "roasted on an open fire" flavor.

Before proceeding to this week's menu, I would like to reply to the
comment made by a correspondent last week, summarized thus by the
editor in the previous issue:

"We received a note here this week about our starting the cookery
club. It was pointed out that we were perhaps, trying to achieve
something that is not possible, i.e. the recreation of dishes whose
recipes were published in some cases over 100 years ago, when tastes
and ingredients were completely different from today's instant tv
dinners."

My response: Of course we can not replicate exactly the dishes of one
or two hundred or more years ago, but it's fun to try, and in doing so
we learn a little bit about life back then. And there is certainly a
general interest in the cooking of times past, as evidenced by the
books of "Grandmother's Recipes" and the "Olde Englishe Fudge" and so
on that is for sale in America, Britain, and doubtless other countries
as well. The reason I like old recipes is exactly because they can be
so different from what we're used to, and because they give us a
window into the past. The older the recipe, the better I like it. So
what if my milk is pasteurized and my flour doesn't contain weevils
and I'm not going to kill the chicken myself. This way I can get a
taste of the past without all the inconvenience our grandmothers had
to put up with.

On to this week's menu. As we are exploring our current collection of
cookery books, it becomes clear that the range is a bit limited in
certain ways. For instance, we thought of doing a menu for Eid, or a
menu for Hanukkuh, but we just didn't find the recipes in our existing
cookery books. There's a hint to anyone who would like to enrich and
expand our cookery collection in a different direction!

So, the next few menus are going to be heavily
Christmas-oriented. This week we are sampling some Christmas sweets.

From 365 Foreign Dishes
http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/1/0/0/1/10011/10011-h/10011-h.htm

Hungarian Spice Cakes.

[These are not labeled "Christmas" cakes, but were suggested as a
December recipe, and certainly contain the traditional Christmas
ingredients.]

Sift 1 pound of flour; beat the yolks of 4 eggs with 1 pound of sugar;
add 1/2 ounce cinnamon, 1/2 ounce of ginger, 1/4 teaspoonful of
cloves, some grated lemon peel and a pinch of salt. Make all into a
dough and roll into small cakes about an inch in diameter. Put on
well-buttered baking-plates, sprinkled with flour, and bake in a
moderate oven until a rich brown. Serve with wine.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06/8loc410.txt

FRUIT CAKE

3/4 c. raisins
1/2 c. milk
3/4 c. currants
2 c. flour
1/2 c. finely cut citron
1/2 tsp. Soda
1/2 c. butter
1 tsp. Cinnamon
3/4 c. sugar
1/2 tsp. Allspice
2 eggs
1/4 tsp. Nutmeg
1/2 c. molasses
1/4 tsp. cloves

First prepare the fruits for the cake. Cream the butter, stir in the
sugar gradually, add the eggs unbeaten, and continue beating. Add the
molasses, milk, and flour with which the soda and spices have been
sifted, and then fold the fruits, which have been prepared, into this
mixture. Another way of adding the fruit is to pour a layer of the
cake mixture into the cake pan, sprinkle this generously with the
fruit, then another layer of dough and another layer of fruit, and
finally a layer of dough with just a little fruit sprinkled on
top. Whichever plan is followed, prepare the pan by covering the
bottom with 1/2 inch of flour and then placing a piece of greased
paper over this. This heavy layer of flour prevents the cake from
burning. Put the cake in a very moderate oven and bake for about 2
hours. If a fruit cake without a heavy crust is desired, the mixture
may be steamed for 3 hours in an ordinary steamer and then placed in
the oven just long enough to dry the surface.


CHRISTMAS PUDDING

(Sufficient to Serve Twelve)

2-1/2 c. stale bread crumbs
1/2 c. milk
1 c. beef suet
1/2 c. sugar
1/2 c. molasses
2 eggs
1 c. chopped raisins
1/2 c. chopped citron
1/2 c. chopped nuts
1 c. flour
1/2 tsp. Soda
1 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. Salt
1/3 c. fruit juice

Soak the bread crumbs in the milk. Work the suet with the hands until
it is creamy, and to it add the sugar, molasses, and well-beaten
eggs. Mix with the milk and bread crumbs, and add the fruit and
nuts. Mix the dry ingredients and sift them into the mixture. Add the
fruit juice, turn into a buttered mold, and steam for 3 hours. Serve
hot with hard sauce or any other desired sauce.

From Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry Cakes, and Sweetmeats, by Miss Leslie
http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04/svfvr10.txt

GINGERBREAD NUTS

Two pounds of flour, sifted.
One pound of fresh butter.
One quart of sugar-house molasses.
Two ounces of ginger, or more, if it is not very strong.
Twelve dozen grains of allspice, powdered and sifted
Six dozen cloves, powdered and sifted.
Half an ounce of cinnamon, powdered and sifted.
A half tea-spoonful of pearl-ash or salaeratus, dissolved in a little vinegar.

Cut up the butter in the flour, and mix it with the ginger and other
spice. Wet the whole with the molasses, and stir all well together
with a knife. Then add the dissolved pearl-ash or salaeratus. Throw
some flour on your paste-board, take the dough (a large handful at a
time) and knead it in separate cakes. Then put all together, and knead
It very hard for a long time, in one large lump. Cut the lump in half,
roll it out in two even sheets, about half an inch thick, and cut it
out in little cakes, with a very small tin, about the size of a
cent. Lay them in buttered pans, and bake them in a moderate oven,
taking care they do not scorch, as gingerbread is more liable to burn
than any other cake, You may, if you choose, shape the gingerbread
nuts, by putting flour in your hand, taking a very small piece of the
dough, and rolling it into a little round ball.

10. A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens (etext #98)
http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext94/2city12.txt


First Lines:

a. There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin, a
careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play all day long in the
streets with little idle boys like himself.

b. Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
Rose out of CHAOS:

c. Dr. Howard Archie had just come up from a game of pool with the
Jewish clothier and two traveling men who happened to be staying
overnight in Moonstone.

d. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this
continent a new nation:  conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal.

e. A throng of bearded men, in sad-coloured garments and grey
steeple-crowned hats, inter-mixed with women, some wearing hoods, and
others bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the
door of which was heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron
spikes.

f. Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had peeped
into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice,
'without pictures or conversation?'

g. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age
of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was
the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter
of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we
were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other
way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that
some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for
good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

h. When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another, and to assume, among the Powers of the earth, the separate
and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God
entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires
that they should declare the causes which impel them to the
separation.

i. A spectre is haunting Europe -- the spectre of Communism.

Credits

I know we didn't include any credits last week, although I suspect
this was probably the smallest of our errors. This now leaves me with
a list of people to thank that would put an Oscar winner to shame, but
here goes.

Thanks to Brett and George for the numbers and the booklists, Thierry,
Gali, Tonya, Greg 'structure guy' Newby, Michael Hart, Larry
Wall, Steve Herber and Jon Hagerson. Thanks also to Branko Collin and
Michael Dyck for their help with the website. A huge thank you to
Brett Fishburne for his help with the automation, Nick Park and Peter
Hall for inspiration, and a special mention for Simon Kirke, Paul
Rodgers, Paul Kossoff and Andy Fraser for keeping me sane on Sunday.
