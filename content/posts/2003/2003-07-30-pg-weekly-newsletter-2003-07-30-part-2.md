1) Editorial

Hello,

After all my moaning last week about not getting any mail, someone
wrote in to explain that it might be that I never say anything
controversial. Well, pass me the tin-opener I have some worms to set
loose*. In the second of today's news stories, you will read that we
have been asked by Amazon to help with their latest project. This is
something which Michael Hart is requesting your feedback on, your
thoughts are important here. Please take a look at the article and
mail us with your comments, you will find both the newsletter and
Michael's email addresses at the end of the article.

Happy reading,

Alice

*Please note I am not actually in favour of putting worms into tin
 cans, I think it's cruel. It's just an expression.

(news@pglaf.org - If you hit reply, the mail you
send does not reach me and disappears into the ether, it's my
anti-spam policy.)

We welcome feedback and awkward questions at the address above. Please
feel free to send our general ramblings to a friend.

Thank you to everyone who reads this bit, especially Joel Erickson,
Jack Gartin, Holly Ingraham and John Green who all sent me a mail to say so,
it's nice to know you're out there.

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

2) News

Distributed Proofreaders Update

I know this is a PG newsletter, but symbiosis is an important thing
(it's also very difficult to spell!).

Distributed Proofreaders has set a few notable milestones over the
past few weeks and I thought it worth mentioning them. As of the time
of writing, the monthly total amount of pages proofread was standing at
a huge 118,311. That's

118,311 pages.

Their aim this month was a mere 95,010, which has been
totally shattered. DP has so far posted over 1700 books to Project
Gutenberg, in July alone 180 have been submitted. As Thierry put it
so well in the forums "What a fine library room that would be." There
are also well over 1,000 projects waiting in the queue to be
proofread, indicating a great future for both DP and PG.

So, time to pour a frosty drink, and having toasted the second
birthday of PG Australia (see pt1), please raise your glass to
Distributed Proofreaders.

We thank you all.

Amazon Says They Want To "Partner" With Project Gutenberg

Amazon Has Asked For Our Help With This, What Do YOU Think We Should Do?

AMAZON TO ADD TEXT-SEARCHING FEATURE
Amazon.com is working on a new program to offer users the ability to
search thousands of nonfiction books. In the Look Inside the Book II
program, users would not be able to view the entirety of any text but
could search for words or phrases across many thousands of texts. The
results would show the sentence where the term appears, and users could
expand that sentence to see several pages before and after the term.
Amazon is currently negotiating with many large publishing houses to
make content available in the program, which Amazon argues will be an
incentive for customers to buy more books. Most of the publishers
Amazon has talked to have reportedly been interested in the program,
though they are concerned about exposing too much of their material.
Users who were able to see just a few pages of reference books and cookbook=
s,
for example, might see all they need to see and not buy the book.

This is the article run in last week's Edupage. Project Gutenberg has
been invited to join in with this project, and we would like to know
what YOU think. You can mail us either here at the newsletter
news@pglaf.org, or you can mail Michael Hart directly at
hart@beryl.ils.unc.edu with the subject Amazon (this makes sorting the
mail simpler, thanks)


                    -------------------

Improved Service

In a bid to make the newsletter more helpful to readers who may be
using screen reading software. We are able to offer the booklisting
normally contained in part 3 in a different format to make your life a
little easier. An example of the new style listing is given below. If
you would like either a daily or weekly version of this list please
email news@pglaf.org, and state which version you require.

{Note to the unwary: this is an example, the real booklist is in part 3.}

3) Notes and Queries

Request for sponsorship

From Ted Garvin

There are some books of historical/literary significance that I would
like to get through ILL (Inter Library Loans). Only one problem (aside
from finding time to scan them, but I seem to manage in that area),
and that is lack of funds.

So this is a plea for sponsorship. Email Ted at garvint at yahoo.com

Interesting Books this week

Charles O'Malley, Vol. 1, by Charles Lever  Jul 2005 [#2][?mly1xxx.xxx] 8577

The excerpt from the Preface is an example of the lovely style of the
author of "Harry Lorrequer".

Notes:

Charles O'Malley: the Irish Dragoon (1841): the best of Lever's early works
 and a superb example of a fast-paced, humorous, adventure-bestrewn Victorian
 military novel. In its lack of disciplined structure the novel has been
 compared, by some eminent critics, with the tradition of oral story-telling
 in Ireland.

Excerpt from the Preface:
The success of Harry Lorrequer was the reason for writing Charles O'Malley.
That I myself was in no wise prepared for the favor the public bestowed on,
my first attempt is easily enough understood. The ease with which I strung
my stories together,--and in reality the Confessions of Harry Lorrequer are
little other than a note-book of absurd and laughable incidents,--led me
to believe that I could draw on this vein of composition without any limit
whatever. I felt, or thought I felt, an inexhaustible store of fun and
buoyancy within me, and I began to have a misty, half-confused impression
that Englishmen generally labored under a sad-colored temperament, took
depressing views of life, and were proportionately grateful to any one who
would rally them even passingly out of their despondency, and give them a
laugh without much trouble for going in search of it.

With many thanks to David Widger for bringing this to my attention.

for those who wish to obtain these new ebooks, please refer to the
following section.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download

or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Please visit the site:
http://www.pgdp.net for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

 If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

 Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

********

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time or
technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Send email to
dphelp@pgdp.net saying that you are interested in post-processing and we
will help you find a project to work on.
