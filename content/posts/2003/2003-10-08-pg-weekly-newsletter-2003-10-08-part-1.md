I am working on trying to collect and convert some public domain folk tunes
to ABC notation.  Could use some help tracking down public domain versions
of the melodies or proof that these songs are in the public domain.  Songs
I'm working on at present include:
I Know Where I'm Going
Simple Gifts
She Moved Throught The Fair
A Sailor Courted a Farmer's Daughter (aka Constant Lovers)
The Fisher Who Died in His Bed
Ufros Alienu
If anyone's interesting in converting folk songs to a digital public

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test DVD here right now!!!  Nearly all
of our first 9,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://gutenberg.net/list.html  can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer.


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 40 weeks of this year, we have produced 3063 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3063 eBooks!!!

         That's 40 WEEKS as Compared to ~30 YEARS!!!


With 9,806 eBooks online as of October 08, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.02 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.64 when we had 6108 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 9,806 books each costing $.62 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 9,806 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 9806 eBooks in 32 Years and 4.00 Months We Averaged
    303 Per Year   [We do more per month these days!]
     25 Per Month
    .81 Per Day

At 3063 eBooks Done In The 280 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     10.9 Per Day
     76.6 Per Week
    340.3 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


From Newsscan:

COLEMAN TO PUSH FOR LOWER COPYRIGHT-INFRINGEMENT FINES
Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.) said this week he intends to introduce
legislation that will lower the fines for those found guilty of sharing
copyrighted music files. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA), violators face fines of between $750 and $150,000 per song.
Coleman, who earlier this week chaired a hearing on the issue of file
sharing and recording industry efforts to curb the practice, said the
range of fines is unreasonable. Facing the prospect of having to pay
$150,000 for each copyrighted song, he said, "forces people to settle
when they may want to fight." Coleman also took issue with the DMCA
subpoena provision, which allows copyright owners to obtain identities
of suspected infringers without approval of a judge. Coleman voiced an
opinion shared by many in the P2P community that there should be some
level of judicial review for the subpoenas. A spokesman for the
Recording Industry Association of America, which supports the DMCA as
it stands today, said,

"Given the scope of today's piracy epidemic,
we must not weaken the hand of copyright holders."

MICROSOFT $10.5 MILLION CONSUMER SETTLEMENT
Microsoft has agreed to pay $10.5 million to consumers who complained in a
class-action lawsuit that they were overcharged when they bought software
directly from the company. About 550,000 licenses are represented in the
class. Rob Helm, an industry analyst and Microsoft-watcher, says: "It's
certainly not going to put a dent in Microsoft's pockets. This is clearly a
victory, in the sense that Microsoft wants to settle these cases. From a
Microsoft perspective, the bad PR outweighs any benefit it would gain by
fighting this to the bitter end." (AP/2 Oct 2003)

VERISIGN AGREES TO SUSPEND SITE FINDER SERVICE
VeriSign and ICANN reached a temporary truce Friday, with VeriSign
acquiescing to ICANN's demand that it suspend its controversial Site Finder
service pending further technical review. ICANN could have fined VeriSign
as much as $100,000 or even revoked its contract to manage the master list
of .com and .net Internet domain names. Critics have charged VeriSign with
undermining the collectivist culture of the Internet with the preemptive
launch of its service, which redirects Web users who mistype a URL to the
VeriSign Web site. "In the past when you made a dramatic change to the
network structure that was the least bit potentially damaging, you went out
through the community and you exposed what you were going to do and got
reaction," says Carnegie Mellon computer science professor David Farber.
VeriSign "just broke the whole process." In its defense, VeriSign
executives say they notified ICANN of their plans ahead of time, but
admitted that they sidestepped ICANN's lengthy approval process because
it's too slow. In response, ICANN says it's "sympathetic to concerns" about
its process and has proposed a more streamlined procedure for reviewing new
services such as Site Finder. (Wall Street Journal 6 Oct 2003)

TRACKING LIBRARY BOOKS OR TRACKING PEOPLE?
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which concerns itself with civil
liberties issues in cyberspace,  is expressing dismay over a plan by the
the San Francisco Public Library use RFID technology to track books. A RFID
(radio frequency identification) chip would be inserted into each library
book, and would send out electromagnetic waves that would allow tracking of
the book's location. San Francisco's city librarian Susan Hildreth says the
RFID devices will help streamline inventory and prevent loss, and explains
that tracking people is not the goal; "It will not allow us to track people
to their home or any location." Hildreth's response has failed to satisfy
Electronic Frontier Foundation Lee Tien, who worries: "We're talking about
the imbedding of location trafficking devices into the social fabric."

MICROSOFT SUED FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY SECURITY FLAWS
Film producer Marcy Levitas Hamilton, whose Social Security number was
stolen by network vandals, has filed a lawsuit aimed at holding Microsoft
responsible for damage stemming from security flaws in its software. The
suit is designed to form the basis of a class action, and alleges that the
majority of cyberattacks trace back to vulnerabilities in Microsoft
software. Internet security and privacy consultant Richard M. Smith sasy:
"This is the first time Microsoft has had its feet held to the fire on
security issues." Hamilton's lawsuit notes that after the vandals stole her
Social Security number, her bank accounts were accessed and frozen, and her
attorney says: "They completely cannibalized her life." Microsoft executive
Sean Sundwall responds: "This complaint misses the point. The problems
caused by viruses and other security attacks are the result of criminal
acts." (USA Today 7 Oct 2003)

[Grammar Aside:  This Means The Do Not Call List WILL Be Implemented]

APPEALS COURT STAYS LOWER-COURT RULING BLOCKING DO-NOT-CALL LIST
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed a ruling of U.S. District
Judge Edward Nottingham which has prevented the Federal Trade Commission
from running a national Do-Not-Call registry on the grounds that it
unfairly blocks calls from businesses, but not from charities or political
organizations. The appeals court said in its ruling: "The Supreme Court has
held that there is undoubtedly a substantial governmental interest in the
prevention of abusive and coercive sales practices. The prevention of
intrusion upon privacy in the home is another paradigmatic substantial
governmental interest." The court also noted that Congress had found that
some telemarketing calls "have subjected consumers to substantial fraud,
deception and abuse." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 8 Oct 2003)

SOUPED UP PCs CAN MIMIC TIVO FUNCTIONALITY
SnapStream's Personal Video Station 3 software allows users to record their
favorite TV shows to their PCs, as well as perform many of the control
functions offered by personal video recorders, such as pause, rewind and
fast-forward real-time TV. The $60 software offers a cheaper alternative to
PVRs such as TiVo, which costs about $250 for the box plus a monthly
subscription fee in the $13 range. But there's a catch -- your PC needs to
have plenty of processor speed -- 733 megahertz or faster -- and an $80
tuner card. Similar software is available from InterVideo (WinDVR 3) and
Microsoft's latest version of Windows XP works with the company's $1,500
Media Center Edition PC. (CNN.com 8 Oct 2003)

GENES ON A CHIP
Affymetrix, Agilent, Applied Biosystems, and NimbleGen are some of the
companies that have begun selling postage-size gene-chips, or
"microarrays," of all known human genes (of which there are about 30,000),
thereby lowering the cost and increase the speed of a test that has
transformed biomedical research in recent years. The chief executive of
Affymetrix boasts: "It's sort of a milestone event, very similar to
generating an integrated circuit of the genome." Gene chips detect genes
that are actively being used to make a protein, and scientists try to
understand the genetic mechanisms of disease by seeing which genes are
turned on. Researchers have found that tumors that look the same under the
microscope can differ in terms of which genes are active, and that by
studying gene patterns it may be possible to discriminate between deadly
and harmless tumors -- or to predict the effectiveness of a particular drug
on a particular patient. (New York Times
