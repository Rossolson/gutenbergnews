<pre>The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter 19th November 2003
eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Since 1971

Part 3:  New Project Gutenberg Documents
----------------------------------------------------------------------

-=] ANNOUNCING A MAJOR CHANGE -- UPDATE! [=-

UPDATE:  The below announcement is being resent with changes to
reflect the new website URL for Project Gutenberg, i.e., the old
address of ibiblio.org/gutenberg/ has been replaced with
gutenberg.net.  Please visit http://gutenberg.net for more information.

With the posting of eBook #10001 in November of 2003, a major change in
eBook filenaming was instituted.  Prior to that, Project Gutenberg eBooks
were assigned unique base filenames, usually 5 characters; each of those
files also has a version number, and are arranged by the year they were
released.

Beginning with #10001, the eBook number is also being used as the base
filename.  For example, the plain text version of #10010 will have the
filename 10010.txt; the HTML version would have the filename 10010-h.htm.

Also, with new-style postings, each eBook is posted in a subdirectory based
on the same number as the eBook number; all of the available formats of each
eBook will be accessible in that subdirectory.  eBook #10010 will be in
/1/0/0/1/10010/.  More on this below.

The full URL for the test xersion of #10010 at our main PG download site
is:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/0/0/1/10010/10010.txt

For the zip of that text:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/0/0/1/10010/10010.zip

To download that zip file via ftp from the main PG download site:

  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/0/0/1/10010.zip

Usually, however, the easiest way to obtain Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks is
to start at the main PG search facility:

  http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

There, you can find eBooks by Title or Author; there is also an advanced
search facility, where you may be able to find eBooks based on subject, or
for a particular language.  The main PG database sometimes does not include
more recent additions, so direct access to the files for downloading is also
available.

As these processes and procedures are refined over the coming weeks, we will
keep you updated.


--INSTANT ACCESS TO EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000

eBooks posted since November 2003, with eBooks numbered greater than #10000,
are filed in a different way.  (Note:  The year of release date is no longer
part of the directory path.)  Both the filename and directory path are based on
the eBook number.  For example, the text format of eBook #10010 would be named
10010.txt.

The path is also based on the etext number, and is made up of single digits
corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  So, if you know
the number, you know exactly where to find the eBook!

The path for our example, 10010.txt, would be /1/0/0/1/10010/.  Of course,
the address of the download site would have to be prepended to the path;
if the main PG site was being used, the full URL, including the filename,
would be:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/0/0/1/10010/10010.txt

The zip file of the above would be:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/0/0/1/10010/10010.zip

Using the ftp site at iBiblio to obtain the zip:

  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/0/0/1/10010/10010.zip

And you can see all the available files for #10010 at

  http://gutenberg.net/1/0/0/1/10010/


Corrected EDITIONS of these eBooks replace the old file and are then given the
original filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed and
archived.

New VERSIONS are based on different sources, and are treated as new eBooks,
to which are assigned new filenames and etext numbers.

File formats other than plain text will have a format-designator appended to
the filename, as well as an appropriate file extension.  The following list
indicates the most common formats likely to be found at Project Gutenberg:

  Plain text       12345.txt          12345.zip
  8-bit text       12345-8.txt        12345-8.zip

  PDB              12345-pdb.pdb      12345-pdb.zip

To get to a directory listing you can use either:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/

. . .navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the appropriate
level, and then select the file you wish to download, using your normal
download procedures.


FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000:

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download site (or
a mirror) if you know the filename and year you want.  For example:

  http://gutenberg.net/etext06
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

                              = = = = = = = = = =

     Note:  this listing best viewed with a fixed-width font, such as
            Courier New or similar.
