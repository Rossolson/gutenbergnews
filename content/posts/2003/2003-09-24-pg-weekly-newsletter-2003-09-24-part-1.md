!!!

I need a copy of zip for AIX that can do the "-9" high compression,
and still unzip via the standard unzip programs!!!

***

I am working on trying to collect and convert some public domain folk tunes
to ABC notation.  Could use some help tracking down public domain versions
of the melodies or proof that these songs are in the public domain.  Songs
I'm working on at present include:
I Know Where I'm Going
Simple Gifts
She Moved Throught The Fair
A Sailor Courted a Farmer's Daughter (aka Constant Lovers)
The Fisher Who Died in His Bed
Ufros Alienu
If anyone's interesting in converting folk songs to a digital public
domain format and would like to help or if you want to contact me, you can
do so through the mailing list at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pdsongs

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test DVD here right now!!!  Nearly all
of our first 9,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have
regular needs for intellectual property legal advice

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 38 weeks of this year, we have produced 2840 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 2840 eBooks!!!

         That's 38 WEEKS as Compared to ~30 YEARS!!!


With 9,583 eBooks online as of September 24, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.04 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.66 when we had 6015 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 9,583 books each costing $.61 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 9,583 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 9583 eBooks in 32 Years and 3.50 Months We Averaged
    297 Per Year   [We do more per month these days!]
     25 Per Month
    .80 Per Day

At 2840 eBooks Done In The 266 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     10.7 Per Day
     74.8 Per Week
    334.2 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


From Newsscan:

[We Had A Reply To The Following]

VERISIGN'S SITE FINDER PROFITS FROM TYPOS
Internet registrar VeriSign has launched a new service, Site Finder, that
offers users who mistype a URL a list of alternative Web sites that they
might be trying to reach. Several ISPs do the same thing -- most notably
AOL and MSN -- but critics say that because VeriSign controls the directory
computers for ".com" and ".net" names, they could easily reroute all
queries to Site Finder. "We put so much of our research into developing
this AOL search result page," says an AOL spokesman. "We are reviewing our
potential options. We are strongly opposed to them interjecting themselves
into our members' search experience." Site Finder's suggestions include
both standard search results and pay-for-placement advertisements, which
are identified as such. But while VeriSign VP Ben Turner says the new
service is designed to "improve overall usability of the Internet," Danny
Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Watch, warns that Site Finder's
capabilities could also be abused -- by directing users only to
pay-for-placement sites, for instance. Meanwhile, the new service provides
a much-needed new revenue stream for the Internet registrar. "Right now,
VeriSign's business is not a growing business, and anything that they do to
add the slightest amount of growth is going to be positive," says an
analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. (AP 15 Sep 2003)
http://apnews.excite.com/article/20030915/D7TJ2U5O0.html

[Here Is The Reply]

Remember the other group of quotes: "The Internet interprets &lt;insert
approriate bad thing here&gt; as damage and routes around it".

The Internet Software Consortium ("In response to high demand from our users")
has already issued a patch to BIND (the software which carries out domain
name resolution on 80% of the worlds computers) which has an option to
detect and bypass Verisign's action and return the *right* result.
Technically: the root servers for .com and .net should *never* directly
return an IP address, but should "delegate" the resolution of the domain name
to another name server. The new BIND software enforces this:
if a "delegation only" name server returns an IP address, the software
ignores this and returns the NXDOMAIN error message.
I just installed this software and it works!

Note: there are an estimated 20 million "hits" per day to mistyped URLs:
Verisign is abusing their position of control over the .com and .net
domains to get 20 million free eyeballs per day. BUT: Verisign is
supposed to be a "trust company": they sell SSL certificates
and "DNS Assurance Solutions". They have just lost the trust of
a huge number of sysadmins around the world: I think they are
about to find out "The Value of Trust"!

[Anyone Remember DIVX From Circuit City?]

BMG INTRODUCES 'SMART' CDs
BMG Entertainment is launching a new generation of "smart" CDs aimed at
thwarting file-sharing while at the same time allowing CD buyers to make a
few copies for themselves and friends. The technology will make its debut
next week with the release of "Comin' From Where I'm From" by Anthony
Hamilton. Buyers of that CD will be able to burn three copies per computer
and will be able to e-mail songs to a limited number of people, each of
whom can then listen to the song 10 times before it becomes unavailable.
The MediaMax CD-3 antipiracy technology is made by SunnComm Technologies in
Phoenix. SunnComm rival Macrovision has also developed protective
technology that allows limited copying, and the record labels are watching
closely to gauge fans' reactions. Meanwhile, civil liberties advocates say
the technology is good in principle, but is still too restrictive. "It is
inconsistent with how fair use has always been applied," says Cindy Cohn,
legal director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. (AP/Wall Street
Journal 18 Sep 2003)

UK MAKES SPAM A CRIMINAL OFFENSE
A new law introduced by U.K. Communications Minister Stephen Timms means
spammers could face fines of #5,000 in a magistrates court or an unlimited
penalty from a jury. "These regulations will help combat the global
nuisance of unsolicited e-mails and texts by enshrining in law rights that
give consumers more say over who can use their personal details," says
Timms. The law, which takes effect December 11, follows similar steps taken
by the Italian government, which recently imposed fines of up to 90,000
euros and a maximum sentence of three years in prison for sending spam.
Meanwhile, EU legislation banning unsolicited junk e-mail will be enforced
beginning on October 31, but officials say it may have little effect
because most spam originates in the U.S. and Asia, and thus will be out of
its reach. (BBC News 18 Sep 2003)
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3120628.stm

ICANN ASKS VERISIGN TO SHELVE SITE FINDER SERVICE
ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) has issued a
statement voicing "widespread expressions of concern" over the technical
repercussions possible from VeriSign's recently launched Site Finder
service. Site Finder steers Web users who make typographical errors while
entering URLs to a site operated by VeriSign. Critics say the technical
process by which VeriSign "hijacks" users could disrupt e-mail delivery as
well as impair the ability of ISPs to block "spam" sent from non-existent
Internet addresses -- a common technique for reducing the volume of junk
e-mail. In self-defense, some ISPs and software groups have developed
patches that prevent the Site Finder software from working on their
networks. (Wall Street Journal 22 Sep 2003)
http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB106418646915190300,00.html (sub req'd)

VERISIGN REFUSES TO BACK DOWN
Despite a flood of criticism, VeriSign has told ICANN in a letter that it
won't disable its Site Finder service. ICANN had asked VeriSign to
voluntarily suspend the service until the technical ramifications could be
studied. The controversial service diverts Web users who enter invalid URLs
because of careless typing to VeriSign's own Web site. The Internet
registrar's refusal to back down potentially puts it on a collision course
with ICANN, which oversees its contract with the U.S. Department of
Commerce to manage the master list of .com and .net Web addresses. But
former ICANN board member Karl Auerbach says ICANN has a history of weak

VeriSign of engaging in unfair business practices.

U.S. SLASHES NUMBER OF H-1B VISAS
After bowing to pressure from the high-tech industry to increase the number
of H-1B visas offered to highly qualified foreign workers, the U.S.
government is planning to sharply cut the number from 195,000 to 65,000 for
the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The three-year visas have been used to
bring highly skilled workers, mostly from the Indian sub-continent, to the
U.S. to fill jobs in the computer industry. "Given the weakness of our
current economy, and the rising unemployment we have experienced under
President Bush's stewardship, many who supported the increase in 2000 now
believe that 65,000 visas are sufficient," says Sen. Patrick Leahy
(D-Vermont). Immigration attorneys say the new restrictions will set off a
scramble by companies to fill their slots before the ceiling is reached.

LANDLINE NUMBERS CAN GO MOBILE
Most of the publicity surrounding the upcoming implementation of new cell
phone number portability rules has focused on the ability of cell phone
subscribers to take their numbers with them when they switch carriers. But
in addition to that provision, the new rules will enable phone customers to
switch their landline phone number over to a cell phone and vice versa. And
although it's unclear how many customers will take advantage of the new
flexibility, research firm Gartner Dataquest recently estimated that nearly
10% of residential phone customers would convert their home telephones to
wireless if they could keep their numbers. However, there is one wrinkle
that still needs to be ironed out. While the Bell companies agree that
there's no problem if a residential customer wants to move a home phone
number to a wireless carrier that already has phone numbers in that
person's "rate center" (the first three digits after the area code that
correspond to a specific neighborhood), both landline and wireless carriers
have asked the FCC to clarify whether local phone companies must also hand
over numbers to a cellular company that doesn't already "own" similar
numbers from the same rate center. The complexity of the issue may prove
frustrating for consumers, warns an industry consultant for Cap Gemini
Ernst & Young. "Customers aren't going to understand the issue of rate
centers -- they're just going to know they were denied." The FCC says it
will clarify the rules, but hasn't said whether it will do so before the
Nov. 24 number portability deadline. (AP 19 Sep 2003)

PUTTING A CAP ON BROADBAND USE
Some Internet broadband "heavy users" are receiving notices from their
providers that they're abusing their contracts. Since late summer, Comcast
has been quietly asking its highest-volume subscribers to scale back their
Internet habits, and in some cases even suspending their service after the
first warning. But the biggest frustration for these subscribers is the
perception that these warnings are not triggered by any "predetermined
bandwidth usage threshold," admits a Comcast spokeswoman. The company says
it's not imposing usage caps per se, but rather is trying to reduce stress
on its network as it works to provide ever-increasing download speeds for
all its users. "The industry is leery of explicit caps, because even people
who don't come anywhere near the caps feel like something is being taken
away from them," says a Jupiter Research analyst. But as consumers flock to
broadband services, companies "can't claim their service is unlimited if
there is some kind of informal limit." Meanwhile, Cox Communications has
taken a more hardline approach, limiting subscribers to 2 gigabytes of
downloading per day -- the equivalent of two compressed feature-length
movies or about 400 MP3 songs. AOL Time Warner's Road Runner service has no
cap yet, but the idea is being discussed internally. On the DSL side, phone
companies say they have no limits on their subscribers' usage. "The
customers buy the lines. We make whatever bandwidth they need available to
them," says an SBC spokesman. (CNet News.com 22 Sep 2003)

TERRORISM INFORMATION AWARENESS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE STATES
Remember the "Terrorism Information Awareness" database controversy? That
project would have allowed the Pentagon to assemble a huge collection of
information on all U.S. citizens, including driver's license, credit card
and financial records, etc., but Congress responded to citizens' privacy
concerns by refusing to fund it. Now a similar project is take shape in
more than a dozen states, fueled by $12 million in federal funds. Dubbed
Matrix (Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange), the database is
being compiled and housed in a private company, but will be open to state
and federal law officials, and perhaps even U.S. intelligence agencies. The
project ostensibly is aimed at identifying and tracking terrorists, but
privacy advocates and others say the use of Seisint Inc., a Boca Raton,
Fl., company founded by a millionaire who police say made his money flying
planeloads of drugs back in the '80s, puts millions of Americans' personal
data at risk. "It's federally funded, it's guarded by state police, but
it's on private property? That's very interesting," says University of
Florida law professor Christopher Slobogin, an expert in privacy issues.
"If it's federally funded, the federal government obviously has a huge
interest in it." Already California and Texas have backed away from the
project, citing security concerns, and Florida officials acknowledge that
Matrix appears to skirt the federal laws barring the U.S. government from
collecting routine information on "innocent citizens." "The CIA doesn't
have this now," says Phil Ramer, special agent in charge of the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement's intelligence office. "That's a major
political issue we'll have to cross." (New York Times 24 Sep 2003)

MSN MUZZLES CHAT ROOMS
Microsoft MSN is closing down Internet chat services in most of its 34
markets in Europe, Latin America and Asia, and is limiting service in the
U.S., citing concerns over use of the online forums for pornography scams
and pedophile and sexual predator activities. "We recognize that it's a
common industry-wide problem," says an MSN spokeswoman. "We've taken a look
at our service and how can we make efforts to step up our efforts to
provide a safe environment." In the U.S., MSN will now require chat room
users to subscribe to at least one other paid MSN service, so that it will
have credit card numbers that it can use to track down those who violate
MSN's terms of use. In Canada, Brazil, New Zealand and Japan, MSN will
offer some moderated chat rooms and discussions. The move to restrict chat
use will probably turn out to be a good thing for the company, says one
Microsoft watcher, by allowing it to shed a number of freeloaders. "I think
this change will have welcome side effects, like keeping spammers out of
the chat rooms. But fundamentally I believe this is a move to make MSN more
profitable. It will allow the company to get rid of some infrastructure
that was supporting chat, and to make money on what it leaves in place."

CALIFORNIA BANS SPAM
California Governor Gray Davis has signed into law a measure that makes it
illegal to send unsolicited e-mail to California residents, unless the
recipient has a prior business relationship with the sender. Violators will
be subject to fines of $1,000 for each message and up to $1 million for
blitz campaigns. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City),
will go into effect January 1, and Murray notes it's the first in the U.S.
to hold an advertiser accountable along with the spammer. "We think it's
going to be the toughest bill in the nation. The beauty of this is you go
after the advertisers. They are fineable and attachable," says Murray.
California lawmakers generally agree that it will be relatively easy to win
judgments against spam merchants and their advertisers in state courts, but
actually recovering damages from out-of-state or overseas perpetrators is
more problematic. "It fails to address the core issue about spam. It
totally fails to be able to reach the offshore criminals who are sending
Viagra ads," says Ray Schultz, editorial director of a publication on
direct marketing. (Los Angeles Times 24 Sep 2003)

U.K. MAKES SPAM A CRIMINAL OFFENSE
Britain has passed a law making the sending of unsolicited e-mail a
criminal offense. Those found guilty of violating the new law, which
goes into effect December 11, can be fined up to 5,000 pounds by a
magistrate or an unlimited amount by a jury, though they cannot be
sentenced to prison. The law will require anyone sending a commercial
e-mail or text message to obtain permission first from recipients. The
loophole, however, which has many fuming, is that the law does not
apply to business e-mail addresses. The anti-spam group Spamhaus
characterized the law as a de facto legalization of spam sent to
computer users at work. A statement from the group said, "Britain's
firms will continue to suffer the onslaught of ever more spam, now from
spammers claiming legality." Italy recently passed a similar, though
tougher, anti-spam law. In Italy, a spammer can be fined 90,000 euros
and sentenced to three years in prison.

BROADBAND PROVIDERS CONSIDER USAGE CAPS
Several leading providers of broadband Internet service have begun
instituting usage caps and notifying abusers that their service could
be suspended unless they cut back the amount of bandwidth they use.
Some companies offer stated caps, such as Cox Communications, which
allows customers to download 2 gigabytes per day. Other companies,
including Comcast, do not have explicit limits but have begun notifying
those of its customers who use disproportionate amounts of bandwidth.
The company said 28 percent of its available bandwidth is used by the
top 1 percent of its customers, and those customers have begun
receiving notes from Comcast indicating that they are in violation of
their terms of service. Verizon Communications and SBC Communications
said their services remain unlimited. Usage caps are seen as one of the
variables in the ongoing battle for customers among broadband providers
and between DSL and cable-modem service.
