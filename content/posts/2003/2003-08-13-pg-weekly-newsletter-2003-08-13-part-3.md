eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Since 1971

Part 3

----------------------------------------------------------------------

REMINDER: GUTINDEX eBook numbers now have five digits.!

As we have recently posted our first eBook with a five digit eBook number
(#10701), we have made an adjustment to the GUTINDEXes to accomodate this
change. Basically, the alignment of eBook numbers less than 10,000 have
been moved one space to the right.  This change is also reflected in the
eBook listings below.

Note:  this listing best viewed with a fixed-width font, such as Courier New
        or similar.

=============================================================================

TOTAL COUNT as of today, Wed 13 Aug 2003:   9,036 (incl. 262 Aus.).

Last week the Total Count was 8,961, including 262 at PG of Australia.

A "?" at the beginning of the filename indicates that the eBook is
available in both 7-bit (plain text) & 8-bit (accented) versions.
