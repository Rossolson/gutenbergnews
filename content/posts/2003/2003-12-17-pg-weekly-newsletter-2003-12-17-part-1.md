============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

      If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
      the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
      following:

      1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
      	http://gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
      which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
      http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

      2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
      working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
      years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
      for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
      progress" list:
	      http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

      3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
      date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
      submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
      blank) to:
      	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

      You'll hear back within a few days.



2) News and Comment

San Francisco Meeting Round-up

Everyone seems to be agreed that the get together last week in San
Francisco was a massive success, with many PGers getting together to
finally find out what they all look like and to talk PG, DP and many
other issues.

Highlights included giving away free CDs and DVDs, over 2 million
ebooks every night. There were presentations by Greg Newby and Michael
Hart, and recognition for the work of many Distributed Proofreaders
who have worked on the Copyright Renewals, more on that from Thierry
below. You can read Greg's report about the conference at
http://pglaf.org/conference-notes.txt. There are many issues raised
towards the bottom of Greg's notes that we at PG will need to address
in the future and that will form the new road map of where we want to
go. I hope to raise some of this discussion in the newsletter.

Project Gutenberg CD's and DVD's

We've received a slew of inquiries since the TV coverage
on The Screen Savers on Tech TV last Monday. People want to know where
they can geta PG CD or DVD.


-------- PG CD HOWTO

GETTING A COPY OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG DVD OR CD

We would prefer you download the CD or DVD image, as described
below.  But if you would like a copy, we will send you a copy
in the mail free of charge (you can make a donation to offset
our costs: visit http://gutenberg.net/donate.shtml).  When
possible, we will send you TWO copies, so you can give one away.

You could also use a CD or DVD burner to copy the disc we send.

To receive a CD or DVD:

	email your name and address
	specify whether you want a CD or DVD
	send to: "cd@pglaf.org"

We'll respond to let you know we got your message, and will send a CD
or DVD as soon as we can.  Since the CDs and DVDs are produced by
volunteers (using their home computers), we cannot guarantee fast
delivery.  Discs are sent via USPS or other inexpensive method.

Generally, the discs are hand-labeled and will arrive in a simple
wrapper.


DOWNLOADING IMAGES FOR THE PROJECT GUTENBERG DVD AND CD

You can download these CD and DVD ISO images freely, and you are
encouraged to give away copies.  See the details on the CD/DVD project
page for limitations on commercial use.

For both, start here for description, links to the ISO images, and
checksums.

	http://gutenberg.net/cdproject

The ISO format is a single large file.  CD/DVD burning software can
write the file to a CD or DVD, which can then be read in any computer
with a CD or DVD reader.  You need a drive that can write and a blank
disc to write the ISO images.  These files are large, so not suitable
for download over a modem or other slow connection.

*** The DVD: About 9400 of our first 10,000 eBooks (none of the PG of
Australia eBooks are included due to copyright, and the audio eBooks
and human genome are left out due to size):

You can download the Project Gutenberg DVD image directly from these
locations:

ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/cdimages/pgdvd.iso
ftp://beryl.ils.unc.edu/pub/pgdvd.iso
(location: North Carolina.  Very fast network connection)

ftp://underdog.arsc.alaska.edu/images/pgdvd.iso
or "rsync -rlHtSv ftp@underdog.arsc.alaska.edu::images ."
(location: Alaska.  Fast network connection)

ftp://ftp.archive.org/pub/etext/cdimages/pgdvd.iso
(Location: San Francisco.  Fast but saturated network connection)

The DVD file size is 4139646976.
MD5 sum is 59d8a193874349181122ff52e2e3e114


*** The CD: The August 2003 "Best of Gutenberg" CD contains over
950 eBooks.

News Roundup and Requests for Help and Assistance

For all those Portuguese readers out there, we have a new volunteer that
offered to coordinate and help anyone that wants to work on Portuguese
eBooks for Project Gutenberg. His name is Joao Neves and you can get in
touch with him at gutenberg@silvaneves.org.

If you don't have a specific book to work on, take a look first at
Distributed Proofreaders &lt;http://www.pgdp.net/&gt;. There are three
Portuguese eBooks on the first round, one in the second and two in
post-processing. We have the National Library of Portugal as a source of
eBooks, so how many eBooks and which books we choose is up to us.

Sim, i da tua ajuda que precisamos!!!

A small note from Michael Hart

I've been reading.

What's so strange about THAT?

After all, I do eBooks for a living.

Well. . .it's not just WHAT I've been reading,
it's also HOW it is printed. . .with ligatures
all over the place to make it hard to OCR/scan.

Not to mention, that is says eBooks will never
get off the ground. . . .

Distributed Proofreaders Update for December 17, 2003

If you are reading this without your favorite beverage, stop right now
and go correct that situation.  . . . Go on! This week we have a
smorgasbord of newsworthy topics to cover and if you care enough about
PG to be reading this newsletter at all, then I promise you an
interesting, little diversion for the DP segment this week. So go get
a big mug of coffee or tea, maybe a Guinness, whatever oils your
works. I'll be right here waiting when you get back.

Today, December 17th, we mark the 100th anniversary of the moment when a dream
of great significance was realized. A century ago two brothers with a
vibrant vision and a healthy dose of ingenuity set humanity free from
exile on the planet's surface. It is easy to conjecture that the
desire to fly as freely as the birds must follow our race down to the
earliest days of existence. Once it was clear that we could do more
than float up in a balloon, subject to the winds--that we could be
master in the air--the future of Humanity changed forever. A mere 66
years later, the flight that began on a little hill in North Carolina
reached all the way to the moon. 100 years on and our visions now look
to the unlimited vastness of the Universe itself.

When I logged into DP earlier, after several days away, I smiled
broadly to see these words greeting me on my return:

"Today we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Wright
brothers' first flight with some specially selected 'aviation'
material. Come fly with us!"

I smiled as I thought that if there ever was an appropriate slogan for
recruiting new supporters to the vision of Project Gutenberg, this was
it: "Come fly with us!"

All dreams are 'lofty' things. Out of the airy invisible, a rare
individual plucks an intangible idea as it floats by like a
feather. It is a simple truth that we owe everything we are today on
this earth to the rare breed of people who we call "dreamers." Go
ahead and try to touch anything in the room around you, including the
room itself, that was not once an idea in the mind of one
individual. That is who we are and that is how we make things on this
world. Do not let anyone ever tell you different, dreaming is a
wonderful occupation.

One day we may very well travel to other star systems, and on that
journey will be two spirits who on this day 100 years ago raised
humanity's aim above and beyond. As I reflected on that thought
earlier, I smiled broader still to realize that it was in this
potential future that our work in these projects is directly connected
to that day at Kitty Hawk. When our childrens' children take off
towards other worlds, it is a certainty that they will be bringing
legacies from home with them. Legacies that will survive to their
generations partly because of the work we do in the present.

What Michael Hart began thirty years ago, with the words: "We hold
these truths to be self evident..." has taken a trajectory not
dissimilar to that of the Wright brothers. More than 10,000 works have
followed the Declaration of Independence, and in years to come that
number will eventually reach 1,000,000.

Come fly with us! Yes, how appropriate indeed!

This is a good to look back upon the Gutenberg journey and forward to
the future. Over the past 48 hours those who gathered together in
California have returned home and begun settling back into their daily
routines. It is a safe bet that no one who participated in the
meetings and discussions of the past several days is quite the same as
they were a week ago. We are distributed throughout the world, and we
get a great deal accomplished that way. However the infusion of
energy, innovation and inspiration that is generated by face to face
interaction in real time adds a whole new level of dynamism to our
collective efforts.

You have been and will continue to read accounts from those who were
there. I was not at the meetings, so my scope of intention will remain
with providing the news items of the events for you. One of 'flash'
items from the conference was the recognition of the significance of
the completion of the Copyright Renewals. If you have been with DP
more than a couple of months then you know what a 'piece of work'
these projects were to complete. Working from the trenches of the
proofing rounds, you may not be aware of the incredible worth of these
dry manifests. They are nothing short of golden in their value to the
public domain. In time we will look back and say: "Yes, I was there,
I worked on the renewals." And we will say it with deep pride.

One person who has provided material recognition of the present worth of
the Copyright Renewals is Brewster Kahle. To commemorate the successful
completion of DP's work on the CR's, Brewster kept a promise to donate
$10,000.00 to Project Gutenberg. Now 10K certainly does not alter the
destiny of PG. It is a significant gesture and a contribution that
proofers at DP can feel a true part of. Through the Internet Archive,
Brewster has long been a supporter of PG and DP. He also provided a
variety of support to see to the success of this week's conference.

When the CRs are incorporated into a searchable database they will
serve to verify the eligibility of thousands of publications for the
public domain. This is task is so tedious at present as to be nearly
unworthy of the effort involved. The easy availability of the
Copyright Renewals will change that forever, thus making available an
immeasurable wealth of cultural and historic content to the whole
world. On behalf of all who this accomplishment eventually touches,
let me voice a sincere and profound appreciation to all those who
worked on the many stages of the CR project!

What the conference provided on the whole, was the chance for many
people to get down to some serious discussion of the present state,
future directions and possible strategies for PG and all affiliated
projects. Topics included; sustaining and increasing the participation
levels of volunteers; innovations to the cataloguing system for the PG
library; initiation of an image library; increase of support to the
readers of e-books; incorporation of XML and the future availability
of format on demand features of PG titles; community development among
the readership; derivative content developments from existing texts
and much more.

Whether these all come to be and in what manner and time frame will be the
topic of future discussions and conferences on-line and off. As I
discuss these topics with those who were out in California, I will
share more details with you here in the weeks ahead. I know that many
people reading this will wish they could have been out there at the
conference. If it is any conciliation, I share your
feelings. But... let us remember what we are celebrating at DP in
December... the conclusion of what is surely the most productive and
successful year in the project's history, and the coming of what
promises to be the year which will--far and wide--supplant that title.

We have shared the journey through this wonderful year together and
have given the best of our efforts and intentions to PG/DP. In the
year ahead we will do the same and perhaps far more. There will be
more meetings and conferences in different regions and countries and
with each we will build upon what has begun in California. Look
forward then, and stay close to your newsletter in the weeks ahead. In
2004 we will fly...and no doubt, more than once or twice we will
glance up at the stars and smile, knowing there is a vast and wondrous
destiny aloft, which we are all a part of.

With my travels and personal time constraints over the past couple of
weeks it has been necessary to set down the continuation of our
exploration and profiles of the tools involved in the DP production
process. Today we will pick up where we left off and take a look at
the pair of tools developed by Steve Schulze aka: ThunderGnat to the
DP community. We also have a piece this week from Bill Keir about
those pesky little sprites that trip up the best proofreaders and go
by the name of Scannos.

The pair of tools known as GUIPrep and GUIGuts are much adored by the
content developers and post processors of DP. It is rather an
injustice to call them a "pair" of tools as they both perform a wide
range of processes that have come to be essential to efficient and
expedient production. From the beginning, we decided that the best way
to provide you with the latest and most informative background  to the
tools is to let the developers speak for themselves. So without
further introduction I turn the mic over to Steve.


Musings on Guiguts

Guiguts came about because of my frustration with Proofreaders
Toolkit, an older, no longer supported toolkit that was used to
prepare texts for Distributed Proofreaders. Proofreaders Toolkit
(PRTK) has a GUI front end to gutcheck built into it. It works, but
there are several things about it that are sub-optimal.

Number 1. It was designed to work with an older version of gutcheck.
The command line options for gutcheck have changed slightly since the
PRTK was written, so it doesn't interface very well.

Number 2. An even bigger problem, every time you make an edit to the
file, the list of gutcheck errors becomes unsynchronized and it gets
hard to find subsequent errors that gutcheck reported.

I had previously written a preprocessing application called Prep to do
pre-proofing checks on texts before they were uploaded to the
site. After 8 versions of Prep, I added a Gui front end to it to make
it easier to select options for processing. (There were some 30 or so
options and the command line was getting out of hand. There's over 60
now.) When I added the front end, I changed the name to Guiprep to
differentiate it from command line Prep.

When the frustration level with PRTKs interface to Gutcheck grew too
much, I thought, "Heck, I could probably write something to do that."
and did so. When it came time to naming it, I thought "Well, I already
have Guiprep, a Gui front end to prep; this is a Gui front end to
gutcheck, I'll call it Guigutcheck. But that was too long, so I
shortened it to Guiguts. (which I found amusing anyway, so that was a
big plus too.)

Guiguts is written in Perl to take advantage of it's very powerful
text processing functions and cross platform support. It will run on
Windows and Linux platforms and could be easily modified to work on
Mac OSX, (but I don't have access to an OSX system to do development
and testing.) It unfortunately cannot be easily ported to Mac OS 9 and
earlier due to lack of some necessary Perl modules for those
OSes. Since it is written in Perl, the source is automatically
available for experimentation and hacking to anyone who is inclined to
do so. I also distribute a compiled windows executable version
(winguts.exe) for those who don't have a Perl interpreter on their
machine and just want to download and go.

Guiguts was originally intended just to be a front end to gutcheck. In
order to make it usable, I had to make it a fairly full featured text
editor so you would be able to make corrections to errors gutcheck
reported. So, since I already had a fairly decent text editor written,
I figured I'd add some other specialized functions that would come in
handy for some texts I was post processing. I think some of the first
functions I added were to do bulk change of case to selected
text. (Make it all uppercase, lowercase, whatever.) Not too unusual in
a decent text editor, but useful. Another thing I added early on was a
word frequency and comparison function. It would count all of the
words in a text and how many times they occurred, then let you display
them in various sort orders. (By frequency, by alphabetical order,
etc.) I wrote a function to help find "stealth scannos", words that
commonly mis-scanned but will pass a spellcheck, like "arid" for "and"
for instance.

As time went by, a core group of intrepid testers suggested new
functions and improvements to existing ones until it has become a
fairly powerful and comprehensive post processing toolkit on its own.

A partial list of functions and capabilities:

Search & Replace: Full search and replace functions, search for full
or partial words. Able to search using regular expressions with
variable extraction for replacement terms.

Stealth Scannos: Find words that were scanned incorrectly but will
pass spellcheck.

Spell check: Provides hooks to tie in Aspell or Ispell to do full
interactive spell checking.

Find Orphaned Brackets: Often brackets or parentheses are mismatched
in a text, it can be a real pain to find the unmatched ones, this
function makes it easy.

Case Adjustment: An array of bulk case adjustment functions, convert
to uppercase, convert to lowercase, convert to sentence case, convert
to title case.

Bulk indenting: Indent a selection of text in or out 1 space with each
press,preserves relative indenting.

Text Rewrap: Automatic rewrap of selected text. Adjustable rewrap
margin. Adjustable indent. Lots of options.

Word Frequency Analysis: Sort and count words in the text. Specialized
sub functions to find hyphenated words, words with accents, words with
mixed alphabetic and numeric characters, and several others.

Footnote Fixup: Functions to automate renumbering, moving and
reformatting footnotes.

HTML Fixup: Functions to work with HTML markup including finding
orphaned markup and auto generating a HTML version of a text.

ASCII Box Drawing: Automatically draw ASCII boxes around selected
text. Optionally rewrap and center or left or right justify the text
in the box.

A whole host of other specialized functions.

And oh yes, it provides a GUI interface to gutcheck.


Thank you, Steve! ... for the background and all the effort to develop
these powerful tools for the PG/DP community!

Now Big Bill is going to fill us in on the slippery bane of all post
processors, the dreaded Tasmanian Scanno. Okay, so they're not from
Tasmania, but Bill has doing his best to exile them there for the rest
of us.

=======================
Stealth Scannos by Bill Keir
=======================

In the late 19th century wasn't the telephone considered wonderful
modem technology? Or was it wonderful *modern* technology?

A standard step in preparing a text for PG is to spell-check it. Of
course that can only do so much, and while it will detect words that
have been OCRd as junk, it won't detect words that have been OCRd as
other words.

When "he" is OCRd as "fe", we have a scanno - analogous to typo - an
error. Spell-checkers will catch scannos that produce non-words;
that's what spell-checkers do, identify non-words.

But when "he" is OCRd as "lie", we have a scanno that a spell checker
will not blink at - a stealth scanno, that flies under the
spell-checker's radar.

Tonya was the first to publish a list of the most commonly occurring
scannos of this type, as part of her comprehensive PPing
checklist. Classics she cited included "arid" being produced for
"and", "yon" for "you" and "modem" for "modern". These occur so often,
and as the words appear so similar on the screen (unless you're using
a custom font, see below) are so often missed by human eyes as well as
spell-checkers, that Tonya suggested it was worthwhile searching your
text for "arid", as most of them were probably mis-scanned "and"s.

I named them and offered to be a central clearing house for reported
sightings. We now have hundreds of stealth scannos and more every
month. Various software tools make use of the listings, and once again
the cooperation of many individuals has led to improving the standards
of quality of our submitted texts.

Thank you, Bill!   Next week we will profile two important tools that
Bill has developed; the Re-Wrap & Indent script and the Smooth
Proofing font. We will also go back to the original tools of the PG/DP
community: GutCheck and PRTK. As we wrap up the tool profiles you can
look forward to a special section on the PG newsletter site set aside
specifically for information on all the tools as well as links to
download the latest versions, whether you work within the DP site or
develop texts for PG independently.

Finally this week, be aware that we have a new feature to the DP
masthead. Where we used to count down the number of titles until
10,000 at PG, we now provide the current total works contributed to
Project Gutenberg by DP. At time of writing, the figure stands at
2,851 books posted.  Watch this space around the first week of January
as we reach 3,000.

Until next week, enjoy your holiday preparations as well as the
continued celebrations at DP. This year promises to go out in a grand
style. Keep giving your best and the same will return to fill the
hours of your days.

For now...

3) Notes and Queries, Reviews and Features

Cookery Club, December 17


This week we consider a traditional Olde Englisshe Christmas
dinner. Looking into Dickens' A Christmas Carol (see this issue's
quiz!) we find the following list of seasonal luxuries in the
description of the Ghost of Christmas Present:

"Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys,
geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long
wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters,
red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious
pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made
the chamber dim with their delicious steam."

In the same book, the Cratchits had to be content with "Goose ? [e]ked
out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes."

We suggest something in between to capture the spirit of the olde-tyme
Christmas banquet. The ever-knowledgeable Mrs. Beeton remarks that

"The boar's head, in ancient times, formed the most important dish on
the table, and was invariably the first placed on the board upon
Christmas-day." Oh, for the good old days?.

Moving on to more modern times,

"The common turkey is a native of North America, and was thence
introduced to England, in the reign of Henry VIII. According to
Tusser's "Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry," about the year 1585
it begun to form a dish at our rural Christmas feasts."

However, the traditional favourite remains

ROAST GOOSE

which, as Mrs. Beeton tells us, is "seasonable from September to
March; but in perfection from Michaelmas to Christmas."

Thus, for our menu we propose:

Roast Goose *
Roast Potatoes
Red Cabbage
Mincemeat Pie *
Christmas Pudding +    or,
Trifle ~

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for
one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected
them with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the earth,
the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and
of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions
of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which
impel them to the separation.

Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
Rose out of CHAOS:

10. A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens (etext #98)

http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext94/2city12.txt

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct
the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present
period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its
being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree
of comparison only.
