1) Editorial

Hello,

So, a mini-heatwave reaches the UK. Only in the UK is this news, and
the proofing goes down you might think. Well, think on. The numbers
continue to shoot through the roof, and you can find out the latest
going-on at DP down below. Also, check out whether you got full marks
in last weeks quiz.

Happy reading,

Alice

(news@pglaf.org - If you hit reply, the mail you
send does not reach me and disappears into the ether, it's my
anti-spam policy.)

We welcome feedback and awkward questions at the address above. Please
feel free to send our general ramblings to a friend.




----------------------------------------------------------------------

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2) News

New India Team Forms

Announcing the India team for those who want to read PG books in
Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Punjabi, etc.  We are seeking
volunteers with pre-1923 Indian texts and access to scanners.  Look for
details and updates on http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/indian  For more
info, please contact Maitri Venkat-Ramani: maitri@vexed.org

Thanks!

Maitri



We ran this last week, but I thought we'd give it another go, so if
you're interested, give them a call.

Distributed Proofreaders Update

The posting to the Guardian website has happened
this week, so forums and messageboards are being manned as I
write. The 129,000 page target for this month looks to be in serious
danger already, with over 52,000 pages having been completed
already. There seems to be a serious amount of excitement being
generated over at DP with the amount of books they are getting
through, and it is nice to see the range and style of books expanding
so rapidly.



                    -------------------

Improved Service

In a bid to make the newsletter more helpful to readers who may be
using screen reading software. We are able to offer the booklisting in
a different format to make your life a little easier. An example of
the changed listing is given below. If you would like either a daily
or weekly version of this list please email news@pglaf.org, and state
which version you require.

{Note to the unwary: this is an example.}

3) Notes and Queries

Story Poem Quiz - Answers

Below are the answers to last weeks quiz.

Smarty-pants prize to Holly Ingraham. The editor fully admits to
initially meeting The Raven through The Simpsons.


Excerpts

1. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner etext94/rime10.txt [Etext #151]

All in a hot and copper sky,
The bloody Sun, at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand,
No bigger than the Moon.

--------------------

2. The Ballad of Reading Gaol etext95/rgaol10.txt [Etext #301]

He did not wear his scarlet coat,
  For blood and wine are red,
And blood and wine were on his hands
  When they found him with the dead,
The poor dead woman whom he loved,
  And murdered in her bed.

--------------------

3. Ulalume etext00/poe5v10.txt [Etext #2151]

And I cried -- "It was surely October
    On _this_ very night of last year,
    That I journeyed -- I journeyed down here! --
    That I brought a dread burden down here --
    On this night, of all nights in the year,
    Ah, what demon has tempted me here?

--------------------

4. The Revenge of Hamish etext98/sposl10.txt [Etext #1229]

For at dawn of that day proud Maclean of Lochbuy to the hunt had waxed wild,
And he cursed at old Alan till Alan fared off with the hounds
For to drive him the deer to the lower glen-grounds:
"I will kill a red deer," quoth Maclean, "in the sight of the wife
  and the child."

--------------------

5. The Raven etext00/poe5v10.txt [Etext #2151]

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" --
                         Merely this, and nothing more.

--------------------

6. The Lady of Shalott etext05/8eptn10.txt [EBook #8601]

  On either side the river lie
  Long fields of barley and of rye,
  That clothe the wold and meet the sky;
  And thro' the field the road runs by
  To many-tower'd Camelot;

--------------------

7. Paul Revere's Ride etext98/cphwl10.txt [Etext #1365]

A hurry of hoofs in a village street,
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:
That was all!  And yet, through the gloom and the light,
The fate of a nation was riding that night;

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://www.gutenberg.net allows searching by title, author, language
and subject. Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available
around the world.


These sites and indices are not updated instantly, as additional
research may need to be done by our professional Chief Cataloguer, so
for those who wish to obtain these new ebooks, please refer to the
following section.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that
updated eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99,
etext00, etc.)

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Please visit the site:
http://www.pgdp.net for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

 If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

 Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

********

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time or
technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Send email to
dphelp@pgdp.net saying that you are interested in post-processing and we
will help you find a project to work on.
