1) Editorial

Hello,

Working in Project Gutenberg sometimes feels like waiting for
something really special, you wait for what seems like forever and
then suddenly it appears right in front of you. Sometimes that 10,000
we are working towards feels like it's never going to get here, and
then here we are today discussing what to put out for 8500! To quote
an old song 'Watch those digit counters fall!'

Happy reading,

Alice

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

3) News

Radio Gutenberg

www.etc-edu.com

This month, we inaugurate our DJ book showings.  Each evening at 6 PM, US/CST,
a different DJ will introduce you to a work in the Gutenberg Collection.  Each
week, a new book is offered, and the books belonging to a given month share
some common basis in the mind and heart of that DJ.


All week on Channel 2, Balzac "The Succubus".

Channel One by Day, first week in June, 2003 :

M   Da Cook brings you "Treasure Island".
T   Mozart helps Sammy find Coral Land.
W   Bugsy treats us all to a live reading of Ring Lardner's "The Real Dope",
      with music written then, and some performances from those days.
T   Trout looks into H. G. Wells's "The Invisible Man".
F   The Fishburn Files features "Through Space to Mars".
S   Bugsy returns for more of "The Real Dope".
S   The Fishburne Files returns for adventures on Mars.

Check back next week for new listings.

You can see their reasoning and emotion in the monologues offered up by Bugsy,
the Fishburne agency, Mozart, Da Cook and your humble writer here, a trout by
Kilgore, or any other name.

This first week, we offer you adventure by way of the classic "Treasure
Island" and "Through Space to Mars", pathos in "The Succubus" and
entertainment and instruction in "The Jungle Book".

The synth voice processing used to create these books now understands the
shape of a sentence, clearly separates the characters in dialog, and in some
small way imparts the sense of the speaker's heart, by the character of the
voice used.

In difficult stories, stories with a sensibility of cultures neither American
nor British, the readings demonstrate a precision in pronuncation few living
readers could aspire to.  Balzac's "The Succubus" demonstrates this
in considerable degree.

Over the coming weeks, these virtual actors on an audible stage will grope
toward a more refined shaping of a work's meaning, its social intent, with an
intent of perfecting clarity in the search for a natural presentation.  Our
first step is to make the engine aware of the material being read to the
extent that at any point, it comprehends the word at it is spoken, in the
context of the word it follows, as well as the import of the word that
follows.

We are taking this step in the tradition of great human actors of stage and
screen, who,  regardless what they say, focus effort on the words, just as
they begin to travel about a theater, or your living room.  Success in this
attempt ensures a long-lived tool, that will proper from the efforts of its
users, rewarding with improved results from every effort, because success
will circumscribe the growth of any supporting database, and ensure every
task is completed with the bulk of the effort being poured into the end
product, and not the procedures and customs that tend to grow about support
functions.

And at the same time, with a single throw, we hope to be ensuring the
permanent existence of a library at Gutenberg that can lift new citizens, and
those in difficulty, to an easy and care-free indulgence in the works of our
history, minds and hearts.

Enjoy, download, copy and hand them to everyone you meet.

Look live books, both on the page and in the ear, as in our hearts.

Post Production People Wanted

Well, technically this is a request for help and not news, but I'm in
charge and this is very important so there! Anyway, as you may have
read in part 1, PG needs an average of one more book per day to be
assembled and posted so we really need another PPP (Post production
person - pay attention at the back!). Please, please, please if this is
something you think you can help with get in touch and we will help
you get started.

We thank you.

                    -------------------

New and Improved service

In a bid to make the newsletter more helpful to readers who may be
blind or visually impaired and using screen reading software, we are
now able to offer the booklisting in a different format to make your
life a little easier. An example of the new style listing is given
below. If you would like either a daily or weekly version of this list
please email me at newsletter at schiffwood dot co dot uk, and state
which version you require.

automatic scanner)?  Check whether they're already in
the collection, and if not send them to our scanner
site:
