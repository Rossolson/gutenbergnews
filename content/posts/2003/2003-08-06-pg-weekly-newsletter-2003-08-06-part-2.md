----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Editorial

Hello,

Thanks to everyone who has so far sent in their thoughts on the
link-up with Amazon, if you still haven't put finger to keyboard on
this issue, please mail us with your view.

Happy reading,

Alice

(news@pglaf.org - If you hit reply, the mail you
send does not reach me and disappears into the ether, it's my
anti-spam policy.)

We welcome feedback and awkward questions at the address above. Please
feel free to send our general ramblings to a friend.

Belated hello's to Bowerbird and Tonya Allen, apologies to Bowerbird
for not being included in last week's list,and a big thank you to Malcolm
Farmer for informing me that you can buy chocolate worms in cans
(cruelty-free see!) through the internet, you can never have too much
chocolate!


----------------------------------------------------------------------

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2) News

New India Team Forms

Announcing the India team for those who want to read PG books in
Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Punjabi, etc.  We are seeking
volunteers with pre-1923 Indian texts and access to scanners.  Look for
details and updates on http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/indian  For more
info, please contact Maitri Venkat-Ramani: maitri@vexed.org

Thanks!

Distributed Proofreaders Update

Following on from last week's update, I thought I would let you know
the result of all the hard work at DP in July.

Thanks to some tremendous efforts (and lots of coffee!) DP achieved
124,797 proof-read pages during the month. There was a major effort
to attempt to break 125,000, but a site slow-down in the last few
hours put paid to that, much frustration all around. This month they
are looking for 128,960 pages. With a posting on the message boards of
'The Guardian'* website today hoping to generate more publicity and
volunteers, and a current average of around 4,00 pages a day being
completed, this shouldn't be impossible.


*The Guardian is a UK based newspaper, usually referred to as 'The
 Gruniad' in this house for all the spelling mistakes!`


                    -------------------

Improved Service

In a bid to make the newsletter more helpful to readers who may be
using screen reading software. We are able to offer the booklisting in
a different format to make your life a little easier. An example of
the changed listing is given below. If you would like either a daily
or weekly version of this list please email news@pglaf.org, and state
which version you require.

{Note to the unwary: this is an example.}

Excerpts

1.

All in a hot and copper sky,
The bloody Sun, at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand,
No bigger than the Moon.

--------------------

2.

He did not wear his scarlet coat,
  For blood and wine are red,
And blood and wine were on his hands
  When they found him with the dead,
The poor dead woman whom he loved,
  And murdered in her bed.

--------------------

3.

And I cried -- "It was surely October
    On _this_ very night of last year,
    That I journeyed -- I journeyed down here! --
    That I brought a dread burden down here --
    On this night, of all nights in the year,
    Ah, what demon has tempted me here?

--------------------

4.

For at dawn of that day proud Maclean of Lochbuy to the hunt had waxed wild,
And he cursed at old Alan till Alan fared off with the hounds
For to drive him the deer to the lower glen-grounds:
"I will kill a red deer," quoth Maclean, "in the sight of the wife
  and the child."

--------------------

5.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" --
                         Merely this, and nothing more.

--------------------

6.

  On either side the river lie
  Long fields of barley and of rye,
  That clothe the wold and meet the sky;
  And thro' the field the road runs by
  To many-tower'd Camelot;

--------------------

7.

A hurry of hoofs in a village street,
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:
That was all!  And yet, through the gloom and the light,
The fate of a nation was riding that night;




* Answers will be published next week, along with names of any
  smarty-pants who care to drop me a line with their answers.
                    -------------------

Request for sponsorship

&gt;From Ted Garvin

There are some books of historical/literary significance that I would
like to get through ILL (Inter Library Loans). Only one problem (aside
from finding time to scan them, but I seem to manage in that area),
and that is lack of funds.

So this is a plea for sponsorship. Email Ted at garvint at yahoo.com

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://www.gutenberg.net allows searching by title, author, language
and subject. Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available
around the world.


These sites and indices are not updated instantly, as additional
research may need to be done by our professional Chief Cataloguer, so
for those who wish to obtain these new ebooks, please refer to the
following section.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that
updated eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99,
etext00, etc.)

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Please visit the site:
http://www.pgdp.net for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

 If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

 Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

********

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time or
technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Send email to
dphelp@pgdp.net saying that you are interested in post-processing and we
will help you find a project to work on.
