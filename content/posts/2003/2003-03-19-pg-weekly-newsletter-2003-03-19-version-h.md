Requests for Assistance:

Project Gutenberg has received a generous donation of over 20 Pentium
Pro 100 computers.  If you have a need for a computer to do Project
Gutenberg work or can make good use of computers (setting up a
"Project Gutenberg" section at a local library or school) please
let William Fishburne (william.fishburne@verizon.net) know!
The computers are physically in Northern Virginia and if you are not,
it would be necessary for you to arrange for the shipping cost.
Please send in your thoughts and ideas on how PG can make best use
of this dated windfall!  There are no boxes for most of these, so it
would be MUCH easier to organize a sort of "bucket-brigade" of people
who COULD get to the DC area [20 miles down towards Manassas] and get
some of these a day or two closer to others who may be able to make a
trip part way to get them, etc., etc., etc.  These are GREAT for any
wordprocessing, etc. . .it's just about exactly what I am using here,
for all my Project Gutenberg work.  However, these are NOT good for
the "bloatware" operating systems and programs if you are going to
reload and reboot a lot. . .takes some real time for this.  However,
I scanned the first books I ever OCRed on something much slower. . . .


***

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list: http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to: http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

Statistical Review

(This number includes the etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)


In the first 11 weeks of the new year, we have produced 666 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production.

With 7409 eTexts online as of March 19, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.35 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.08 when we had 4815 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7409 books each costing $0.73 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7409 books each costing 35% less a year later???


At 7409 eBooks in 31 Years We Averaged 19.92 eBooks per month

At 666 eBooks Done in 2003 We Averaged 131.00 eBooks per month

Headlines From Newsscan:

THE IETF APPROACH TO SPAM
The Internet Research Task Force -- loosely affiliated with the Internet
Engineering Task Force standards group -- has formed an Anti-Spam Research
Group, which will focus on the problem of spam proliferation and make
suggestions on ways to change basic e-mail technology to foil the bulk
e-mailers. "Once considered a nuisance, spam has grown to account for a
large percentage of the mail volume on the Internet," says the group's Web
site. "The purpose of the [research group] is to understand the problem and
collectively propose and evaluate solutions to the problem." First steps
will include classifying different kinds of spam and antispam proposals,
and studying ways to track down spammers, who are often difficult to
identify. A first meeting is set for March 20 at the IETF's San Francisco
gathering. (CNet News.com 6 Mar 2003)

THE AOL APPROACH TO SPAM
America Online, which says it blocks an average of 28 junk e-mail messages
per account per day, trashed a billion (presumably unsolicited) messages in
a two-day period this week, without letting them arrive at customers'
in-boxes. AOL spokesman Nicholas Graham asserts that only "an extremely
small fraction" of the messages trapped in AOL's spam filters are
legitimate communications. [We hope he's right. See the last message in
today's mailbag, which concerns NewsScan's experience with spam filters --
though not in this case AOL's.] (AP/San Jose Mercury News 6 Mar 2003)

THE AUSTRALIAN APPROACH TO SPAM
Clive Hamilton, the head of an Australian public think tank, thinks that
Australia's method of Internet regulation, managed by the Australian
Broadcasting Authority, is essentially useless. Referring to a survey
finding that 84% of boys ages 16-17 are exposed to pornography on the
Internet, Hamilton complained: "The Internet industry has convinced the
government that there is little that can be done to prevent pornography
coming in from overseas. But this is false. Mandatory filtering by Internet
service providers (ISPs) would severely restrict the availability of
pornography." Labor information technology spokeswoman Kate Luncy
disagrees: "The cost this would place on ISPs would be prohibitive and
Internet speeds would be significantly reduced. The end result for
consumers would be a slower, more expensive Internet." (The Age 4 Mar 2003)

WHY IS THIS NEWS? DOESN'T IT HAPPEN EVERY DAY?
A Colorado businessman was arrested earlier this week at his Sportsman's

SUSPECTS STEAL MONEY VIA KEYSTROKE MONITORING SOFTWARE
Two Japanese men were arrested for allegedly hacking into people's bank
accounts and stealing $136,000. The men are accused of downloading software
that detects the keystrokes made by a computer user and installed it on PCs
at Tokyo cybercaf=E9s. They then figured out the passwords that five=
 previous
customers had used to access their bank accounts online, and transferred a
total of $141,000 from those accounts to another bank. One of the men,
27-year-old Goro Nakahashi, then used an alias to withdraw $136,000. If
charged with theft, the two could face up to 10 years in prison. According
to the Asahi newspaper, the men allegedly tried to use about 100 computers
at 13 different Internet cafes around Tokyo. (AP 7 Mar 2003)

TWO JUDGES REJECT FBI TESTIMONY IN INTERNET PORN CASES
Federal district judges Denny Chin in New York and Catherine D. Perry in
St. Louis have rejected evidence obtained by FBI agents who claimed falsely
that anyone signing up with the child porn site "Candyman" would
automatically receive child porn images from other site members. Later, the
agents admitted that people signing up for the group had the ability to opt
out of the member mailing list and therefore did not necessarily receive
pornography through that list. Judge Chin wrote: "If the government is
correct in its position that membership in the Candyman group alone was
sufficient to support a finding of probable cause, then probable cause
existed to intrude into the homes" of thousands of people who had merely
logged onto that Web site. "Here, the intrusion is potentially enormous.
Thousands of individuals would be subject to search, their homes invaded
and their property seized, in one fell swoop, even though their only
activity consisted of entering an e-mail address into a Web site from a
computer located in the confines of their homes." (New York Times 7 Mar=

STARTUP LOADS MP3 TUNES ONTO CELL PHONES
A small startup called Xingtone has developed technology that enables
people to load MP3 files onto their cell phones. The user would take an
audio clip of a recording they already own, load it through the conversion
filter and deliver it to their phone. "It's a simple choice: Do people want
their phone to sound like an old arcade game or a radio playing their
favorite songs?" says Xingtone's Brad Zutaut, who currently has a snippet
of the Rolling Stones' "Get Off of My Cloud" on his phone. About 3,000
people have already used the service, which launched a few weeks ago.
Currently, wireless carriers limit clips to 30 seconds, but Xingtone says
as soon as the operators relax these restrictions, it has the capability to
send entire songs to users' cell phones. As an added twist, users can send
their audio clips from the Xingtone Web site to their friends' phones.
Zutaut acknowledges that the new service may raise the ire of the music
industry. "I know that we'll have licensing issues. But if people take
their own music and put it on their phone, it's not my responsibility." He
sees potential revenue streams from eventually moving toward a pay-per-use
model and from co-branding. (Reuters/CNet 7 Mar 2003)

INTEL BETS BIG ON WI-FI
Intel is investing in four Wi-Fi firms in an effort to boost the wireless
technology and build demand for its Centrino chipset, which offers Wi-Fi
connectivity and improved notebook battery life. Financial terms were not
disclosed, but last October Intel had announced plans to invest $150
million in companies pursuing Wi-Fi technology and so far has funded seven
ventures. The latest recipients of Intel's largess are rovingIP.net,
Vivato, Broadreach Networks and Pronto Networks. In December, Intel teamed
up with AT&T and IBM to form Cometa Networks, which will create a
nationwide network of wireless broadband hotspots in stores, restaurants,
hotels, gas stations and other public venues. (Reuters/CNet 9 Mar 2003)

THE FUTURE OF WEBLOGS
Blogging, which a few years ago was viewed as a lot of inconsequential
chatter, is morphing into a cutting-edge phenomenon that may provide a
platform for the Internet's next wave of innovation and moneymaking
opportunities. "Just like the Internet was 10 years ago, blogging is
popular with an underground culture that is doing it for the love and
passion," says Tony Perkins, editor of the recently folded Red Herring
magazine. "Now there are people like me coming along and trying to figure
out how to package it. It's time to take it to the next level." Other heavy
hitters hoping to cash in on the Web's so-called "Blogosphere" include
Terra Lycos, AOL and Google. Last month, Terra introduced publishing tools
to help users launch their own blogs, and AOL plans a similar move later
this year. Meanwhile, Google just snapped up Pyra Labs, which runs
Blogger.com, a network of Weblogs boasting more than 1 million members and
more than 200,000 active blogs. "We want to take what has been an
underground phenomenon and introduce it to the masses," says Charles Kilby,
Terra Lycos' director of product marketing. "This is the 'eBayization' of
the media," says Perkins. "You create a compelling arena and then let the
real entertainment come from the participants themselves." (AP 9 Mar 2003)

AOL'S ANSWER TO TIVO TO BE LIKE TIVO, SORT OF
Recognizing the threat TiVo and similar personal video recording technology
is posing to TV networks and Hollywood studios, AOL Time Warner has been
secretly developing its own version of the technology, called Mystro TV.
Mystro uses the cable system itself to let viewers watch programs on their
own schedules (just as TiVo does), but it lets networks retain a level of
control (dictating which shows users can reschedule) and offers them a way
to insert commercials, which TiVo allows its set-owners to avoid. (New York

LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH DIGITAL COPYING RIGHTS
Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D, CA) is reintroducing legislation called the Balance
Act, intended to give people the right to make back-up copies of copyrighted
digital works for use on other devices (such as car CD players) and to
protect consumers who break technological locks in order to view DVD movies
on their computers. Lofgren says, "Most people -- at least, most adults --
don't expect to get content as a freebie. But when people pay good money to
buy something and then can't use it in the way they've become accustomed to,
it makes them mad." The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the
Business Software Alliance (BSA) strongly oppose the proposed legislation,
which is thought to have just a long-shot chance of being passed. Arguing
that such legislation "would provide safe harbor for pirates," Jack Valenti
of the MPAA said, "As drafted, this legislation essentially legalizes
hacking." (San Jose Mercury News 11 Mar 2003)

DELOADER WORM ATTACKS EASY-TO-GUESS PASSWORDS
A new software worm called W32/Deloader-A tries to guess passwords on
machines running many of the Microsoft Windows operating systems: it
attempts to log on to a machine's administrator account by trying likely
passwords such as 'admin', 'password,' '12345', and 'administrator', and so
forth. The worm is thought to have originated in China. Although Deloader is
considered a low risk for infection, many home computers without firewalls
may be vulnerable to its attacks. (IDG/Computerworld 11 Mar 2003) Shorl:

AT THE BEND IT'S ORACLE, THEN IBM, MICROSOFT, AND NOBODY
Looking at the relational database market, industry analyst Carl Olofson
describes the current situation by noting that "the gap between Oracle and
IBM is narrowing, Microsoft continues to grow, and the three of them are
increasingly well ahead of the rest of the field." Market shares now are
Oracle 39.4%, IBM 33.6%, and Microsoft 11.1%. Compared to market shares a
year ago, Oracle is down 2.3% while IBM is up 2.6% and Microsoft is up by
1.4%. Olofson says that IBM's gain is due largely because many of its
corporate customers (unlike Oracle's customers) are required to renew their
licenses each year. Another factor in the equation is that IBM seems to be
expanding its share of Windows, Unix and Linux environments more rapidly
than Oracle. (San Francisco Chronicle 11 Mar 2003)

AOL DELIVERS USERS FROM 'POP-UP PURGATORY'
America Online is giving its subscribers some relief from the annoying
pop-up ads that seem to be proliferating at an alarming pace across the
Web. In response to complaints from users, AOL will automatically install
its Web Pop-Up Controls onto the desktops of its 33 million subscribers
during the next two weeks. Many AOL users had listed pop-up advertising as
one the most annoying features of surfing the Web. "AOL's new Pop-Up
Controls will allow our members to explore the Web without being trapped in
pop-up purgatory," says an AOL spokesman. The latest move mirrors one made
by rival Earthlink several months ago, and comes as the world's largest
Internet provider is struggling with stagnant subscriber growth over the
past year. (CNet News.com 11 Mar 2003)

ABC NEWS TO OFFER 24-HOUR BROADBAND NEWS SERVICE
As the drumbeat of war escalates TV-news coverage and competition among
networks, ABC News has announced plans to launch a 24-hour Web-based
service available to broadband users. The service, to be called ABC News
Live, in its initial stage will resemble C-SPAN more closely than CNN,
mixing live feeds of breaking news with some anchored coverage, news
summaries every half hour and rebroadcasts of programs such as "World News
Tonight" and "Nightline." There will also be live coverage of UN debates
and White House news briefings, as well as feature segments by ABC News
correspondents that won't be shown on regular ABC news broadcasts. Senior
VP Bernard Gershon called ABC News Live programming "baby steps toward the
first Internet news network" and said he could "see a situation in two or
three years where the broadband space will be competitive to the cable-news
space." The new channel will be available to subscribers of the existing
ABC News On Demand broadband service and RealNetworks' RealOne SuperPass
service. ABC owner Walt Disney says it may entertain future deals that
would make the service available through other broadband providers, such as
cable systems and telephone companies. (Wall Street Journal 12 Mar 2003)

EU SAYS MICROSOFT VIOLATED ANTITRUST RULES
The European Commission has determined that Microsoft violated EU antitrust
rules, and experts on the EC have proposed two major remedies: requiring
Microsoft to share more proprietary information with its rivals and to
unbundle its Media Player software from the Windows operating system. Both
remedies would go beyond the changes agreed to last year by Microsoft and
the Justice Department after courts found Microsoft had abused its monopoly
position in the U.S. operating systems market. The EU's case is still
months from a conclusion, but insiders say an internal commission is
reviewing the recommendations to ensure they will stand up in court and be
technically enforceable. (Wired.com 11 Mar 2003)

INTERNET BOOKENDS: #1, KAHN ON COPYRIGHT
Internet co-founder (with Vint Cerf) Bob Kahn is head of the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI), which he founded in 1986. In an
interview  with John Gehl for the ACM online publication Ubiquity, Kahn
talks about the state of the Internet, including the need for more education
about copyright law:  "We [at CNRI] have been promoting copyright and, more
generally, intellectual property protection in the network probably as much
as anybody in the research world. CNRI built a system for the U.S. Copyright
Office to manage the registration of copyright claims and the attendant
submission of copyright information and digital objects online; the system
is called CORDS (cords.loc.gov). In my view, one of the problems that has
not been satisfactorily dealt with in this country is the widespread lack of
respect for the value of intellectual property. People think that they can
do anything they want with intellectual property just because they
themselves don't happen to see any cost associated with accessing it on the
net and, perhaps sending it to others or otherwise using it. I think this is
clearly an educational issue as much as it is a constitutional issue."

IRAQ WAR WILL BOOST ONLINE NEWS
"What the first Gulf war was to CNN, this one will be to CNN.com and its
peers," says Josh Macht, editor of Time.com. Taking a cue from media
experts who point to traffic spikes after the September 11 attacks and the
space shuttle Columbia disaster, online news operations are gearing up for
higher visitor volume and expanded news coverage capabilities. News sites
like MSNBC.com and FT.com have spent months building special pages
dedicated to the conflict, complete with interactive maps, exclusive
features and downloadable video. "It is a time to show people we can do
amazing things with graphics and pictures," says Macht. "That is going to
build an audience for the future." In the end, however, it may all come
down to timing. One of the recurring stories about the first Gulf war
suggests that the U.S. timed its bombing raids to fit in with CNN's evening
broadcast schedule. The Internet has a very different audience -- people
who catch the news online during the day at work. With Iraq nine hours
ahead of the U.S. East Coast, it remains to be seen whether the military
will adjust their campaigns to fit in with the daytime viewers' schedules.

YAHOO LAUNCHES VIDEO SERVICE
Yahoo, expanding its push into fee-based services, has launched a Yahoo
Platinum video subscription service that offers entertainment, sports, news
video and programs. The service is similar to one offered by RealNetworks,
but Yahoo is trying to differentiate its Platinum service with exclusive
content, such as outtakes from TV programs like "Survivor" and "American
Idol." Yahoo will charge $9.95 a month for a mix of its exclusive and
non-exclusive content, such as the TV outtakes, Nascar coverage, news and
some NCAA games. A special sports package, which includes exclusive Web
coverage of the NCAA playoffs, will cost $16.95 per month. Yahoo is hoping
that its March Madness coverage will lure workers who might have access to
broadband at work but not a TV, as many of the basketball games are
scheduled during daytime hours. Subscribers to the sports package will get
live webcasts of the first 56 games. (Wall Street Journal 17 Mar 2003)

PAYPHONES SEEK NEW LIFE AS INTERNET TERMINALS
Bell Canada is in the midst of a pilot program that offers customers in
Toronto, Montreal and Kingston free Wi-Fi Internet access through hotspots
originating in 16 former payphone booths located in airports, hotels,
libraries, train stations and other public transit locales. As with regular
Wi-Fi access, customers must be within 100 feet of the booth to use the
signal. Bell Canada spokesman Don Blair says the company has received
positive feedback so far: "We've received phone calls and e-mails from
people using the service. The are very positive responses from users, as
well as a lot of calls from location providers -- people wanting to offer
(wireless Internet) hotspots to their customers." Meanwhile, in Singapore,
InfiniTech has a different idea for resuscitating the payphone booth. The
company is looking for U.S. partners to help roll out booths where people
could recharge their cell phones when their batteries run down. Users would
deposit coins and then recharge their phones. (Wired.com 17 Mar 2003)

BEWARE THE SPELLCHECKER
A study at the University of Pittsburgh reveals that the ubiquitous
spellchecker software may be doing as much harm as good, when it comes to
writing. In the study, 33 undergraduate students were asked to proofread a
one-page business letter -- half of them using Microsoft Word, with its
spell- and grammar-checking features and the other half using only their
brains. Without the software, students with higher SAT verbal scores made,
on average, five errors, compared with 12.3 errors made by students with
lower scores. However, using the software, the two groups made about the
same number of errors -- 16 vs. 17. Dennis Galletta, a professor of
information systems at the Katz Business School, says people have come to
rely on spellchecking software too completely. "It's not a software
problem, it's a behavior problem." (AP 14 Mar 2003)

RECORD LABELS WARN COMPANIES OF 'SIGNIFICANT LEGAL DAMAGES'
The Recording Industry Association of America has sent letters to about 300
companies, informing them that their computers were being used by workers
for illegal file-swapping and threatening "significant legal damages" for
employers and employees alike. The new tactic is the RIAA's first
systematic effort to tackle digital music piracy that occurs using
corporate networks, following a similar effort to enlist universities in
the fight against illegal file-sharing. Copyright law experts said
companies might be liable for piracy on their networks if they know about
it and don't intervene, but it's unclear whether companies have an
obligation to police their networks and remove unauthorized copies of songs
without being asked to. "I think what they're trying to do is get people
thinking 'Gee, I'm in this gray area, and I don't want to be the guy who
gets fingered for the test case,'" says one intellectual property attorney.
"As a corporation, do you really want to be in the news defending the right
of your employees to have pirated music on your network?" About 35% of the
letters went to information technology companies, 20% to healthcare firms,
20% to manufacturers, and the rest to miscellaneous industries. (Los

PROFILE OF A VIRUS WRITER
According to the UK's Sophos, one of the world's largest antivirus
companies, about 1,000 viruses are created every month, and in almost all
cases the perpetrators are computer-obsessed males between the ages of 14
and 34. "They have a chronic lack of girlfriends, are usually socially
inadequate and are drawn compulsively to write self-replicating codes. It's
a form of original graffiti to them," says Sophos CEO Jan Hruska. Virus
writers tend to explore known bugs in existing software or look for
vulnerabilities in new versions in order to create and spread their
infections, and Hruska notes that the next target for the virus writing
community could be Microsoft's .Net platform for Web services. To boost the
impact of their creations, virus writers also tend to share information to
create variants of the same infection, such as the infamous Klez worm,
which has been among the world's most prolific viruses in the last year.

BOSTON BUSINESSMAN OFFERS FREE WIRELESS NETWORK
Michael Oh, CEO of Apple reseller Tech Superpowers in Boston, has
launched a free Wi-Fi network along the city's Newbury Street,
described as Boston's Rodeo Drive. NewburyOpen.net is a free,
high-speed wireless network that uses access points in eight cafes,
restaurants, and bookstores along the street. Users who take advantage
of the free network to browse the Internet are shown pop-up ads every
three to four hours. Oh said the network cost about $3,000 to set up
and offers his business a means of reaching consumers that otherwise
would be unavailable. Wi-Fi expert Glenn Fleishman said the Boston
network is the first he knows of that is wholly run by an individual,
commercial company. He said that many companies, however, are beginning
to understand that offering such network access typically does not cost
much and is a way for them to "give something back to the community."

CALIFORNIA BILL WOULD BAN ALL SPAM
A bill before the California legislature would ban all unsolicited
messages sent to e-mail addresses in that state. Consumers who received
spam would be able to sue the sender for at least $500 per violation.
Critics of the measure said that it will do little to stem the flow of
spam because many spammers use hijacked systems to send e-mail or are
outside of the country. An analyst with Jupiter Research said that a
spammer in China is not going to care what the laws are in California.
Debra Bowen, the state senator who wrote the bill, acknowledged that
the measure would not end spam, but she said something needs to be
done. Her bill, she said, would give individual consumers the authority
to tackle spam without having to depend on technology or on a district
attorney. In 1998, Bowen wrote the state's first bill to limit spam,
which requires unsolicited mail to include "ADV" in the subject line.
Louis Mastria of the Direct Marketing Association said that law is
generally ignored and counterproductive.

FACIAL-RECOGNITION SOFTWARE TESTS RELEASED
According to test data released by the federal government,
facial-recognition systems have become significantly more accurate and
reliable since 2000. The tests, which were overseen by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology and covered products from 10
companies, also showed, however, that in certain conditions the
accuracy of the systems dropped to 50 percent. In "reasonable,
controlled indoor lighting," the best of the systems was able to
correctly match facial images with those in a database 90 percent of
the time. The results are expected to support efforts to add
facial-recognition systems, as well as other biometric identification
technologies, in situations where security is vital, such as at
airports.

MARKETERS AND CONSUMERS PREPARE FOR NATIONAL NO-CALL LIST
President Bush this week signed a bill that will establish a national
do-not-call list, similar to lists already enacted in 32 states. The
lists are designed to limit unwanted calls from telephone solicitors.
Under the federal statute, companies that do not comply with the list
can be fined up to $11,000 per call they make to someone who is on the
list. Certain calls are excepted from the regulation, including those
concerning surveys, charities, and calls on behalf of politicians. The
Federal Trade Commission will collect fees to pay for creating and
maintaining the list. VeriSign and a company called Call Compliance
have developed a call-blocking application called TeleBlock, which was
recently sold to PaeTec. Gryphon Networks also markets a product for
the burgeoning call-blocking industry. Some have speculated that a
similar approach could be an effective way to tackle the growing
problem of unwanted e-mail.

TECHNOLOGY GRANTS FOR MINORITY INSTITUTIONS APPROVED
The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
approved a bill to create a $250 million grant program to help
minority-serving institutions develop digital and wireless
technologies. The full Senate is expected to consider the bill. If the
bill passes, Congress will be challenged to figure out how to fund the
program. The bill, S.196, was sponsored by Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).
The National Science Foundation would be authorized to oversee the
grants for five years. Recipients must match a minimum of a quarter of
the grant money with their own funds, a requirement that would be
waived for institutions with endowments of less than $50 million.
