  Novell stopped participating in the Hula open source e-mail and calendaring software project it began in February 2005. According to Novell representative Peter Teichman, business customers already had e-mail and calendaring services in place. The company is thus shifting its resources to other projects, asking members of the Hula community to take over its previous leadership role and to continue working on the code.<em>ZDNet, 29 November 2006</em><br /> <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6139279.html" target="_blank">http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6139279.html</a>
