The Association of American Publishers (AAP) is calling on colleges and universities to take steps to address what they see as rampant copyright abuse by faculty. According to the AAP, faculty who post protected content online for use in their courses cost the publishing industry at least $20 million each year in lost revenues. Before the advent of online reserves, faculty would often place hard-copy materials in the library for students to view. That practice has been largely replaced by making digital copies of course materials available online. The publishing industry objects, saying faculty who do this go beyond the scope of fair use. Allan Adler, vice president for legal and governmental affairs with AAP, said, "We can't compete with free." The organization pointed to a recent agreement with Cornell University in which the institution works to educate faculty on appropriate uses of copyrighted material and on best practices to avoid infringing uses.
The AAP hopes that other institutions will implement programs similar to the one Cornell has adopted._Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 20 November 2006_
