Chinese authorities this week announced an agreement with four trade associations about the ongoing problem of copyright infringement, which is reportedly rampant in China. The Business Software Alliance and the Publishers Association (both in the United Kingdom), the Association of American Publishers, and the Motion Picture Association of America (in the United States) signed the memorandum of understanding, under which the organizations will provide the Chinese government with lists of products that should be protected by copyright law. The four groups will also keep Chinese authorities informed about legal actions against suspected copyright infringers. The National Copyright Association of China will oversee the information from the four groups and will work to improve the country's efforts at enforcing copyrights._CNET, 15 December 2006_
