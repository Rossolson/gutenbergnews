Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com


For now I am leaving PT1a and PT1b combined.

Please also let me know if you think these Newsletters are a waste of
time or if you think I/we should keep doing them.

Thanks!

///

I am including a self-published not about eBook readers for cell phones
with a warning from some of our other cell phone eBook experts that the
process mentioned below might cost quite a bit more than we expected.

///

I would like to submit an item for the weekly newsletter. I think it is
something Project Gutenberg users will find useful.

ACCESS YOUR EBOOKS FROM YOUR MOBILE PHONE
mTextbox is the easiest way to bring your text, articles, even full length
novels with you on your mobile phone. You can upload your own text and
access it from your mobile phone, or browse the online library to see what
others are reading. The service is free during the alpha period, which runs
until the end of the year.

Thank you,
Ivan Yuen

Some Suggestions We Received For The Newsletters


0.
Several people have merely suggested to other readers
that they start from both ends and read to the middle
and thus they will get the highlights first, and then
the regular features, requests, etc. that stay pretty
much the same from issue to issue.

I would agree with this suggestion, and would simply,
for my own edification, also read the "Flashback," as
I find it interesting to see Project Gutenberg eBooks
as they appeared in our catalog x years ago.


1.
Divide the Newsletter in Web page URLs so the readers
could just jump to whatever portions they wanted.
[This would take some additional labor by someone who
was more familiar with writing web pages than I.]

You should already be able to jump to whichever parts
you want to read. . .simply use your search commands,
search for "*" plus the section header as outlined in
The Table of Contents.


2.
Redivide PT1 of the Weekly Newsletter into two parts.

[This would create a lot more work for whomever edits
the Newsletters, which probably wouldn't be so bad if
that were their only responsibility.  I work to point
of exhaustion nearly every single day, and I need for
things to become easier rather than harder.  Hence my
requests for anyone who would like to be editor:  the
format of the Newsletter would be their choice and we
could either turn over the statistics to them, or our
stats people could simply send in that portion, ahead
of the deadline by an hour or two.  We would continue
to encourage our readers to send in news items not in
the main regular media coverage.]


*

We are interested in increasing the "SF" available at Project Gutenberg of
Australia. To this end we are happy to receive donations of ebooks to add
to our collection.

SF, in this context can mean: Science, Speculative, Superhero, Swords,
Sorcery, Spies, Supernatural and Scary Fiction.

Of course, we are only able to accept works that are public domain in
Australia.

Generally speaking, this means that the author died in 1954 or earlier.

Please see our WANTED list at http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html for
authors and works of interest. If you have suggestions for authors or
works to add to the list, please let us know.  Do check first that
they are not already available at Project Gutenberg Australia or
Project Gutenberg, please.  Contact details are provided on the WANTED page.

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

As always, ebooks by Australian authors and of general Australian interest
are always greatly appreciated.

        21,611 [by hand count]       [+ 56]
               [Please note we have several counting methods,
               and they often differ by several book that we
               have to hunt down by hand to reconcile.]
               [Pleast note there is some duplication between
               these various collections.  Volunteers needed
               to take these duplications into account.]

                ~16% of the way from 20,000 to 30,000

               100,000+ eBooks at the PG Consortia Center
               http://www.gutenberg.cc   [185,000+ files]

[Please note that the four collections totals are eBooks that originated
as created, edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and
its 50,000 volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with
100,000+ books contains entire eBook collections from 125+ eLibraries so
the production statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created
by the various teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share
the responsibility of maintaining.  The Consortia Center eBooks were and
are the responsibility of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy
to forward any suggestions for correction to those eLibraries, but those
eBooks must be edited by the donating parties, as per their requests.]

             18,493 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~266 eBooks per Month for ~69.50 Months

            3,469 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

            25 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
             9,268 total from Distributed Proofreaders
               Since October, 2000 [Details in PT1B]
               [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]
            [Note, PGDP mostly included in US eBooks]
         [Note, PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders
          whose total closely matches their grand total]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]


       We Are Averaging ~359 eBooks Per Month This Year!!!
              [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 83 eBooks Per Week In 2006
                        56 This Week
                        48 Last Week
                       172 This Month [Oct]


It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our first 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~12.5 years from Jan. 1994 to Jun. 2006 to go from 100 to 20,100

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to 20,000


Not counting the addition of The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center's
Receipt of ~100,000 eBooks from 125+ Other eLibraries Worldwide which
started in March, 2003.

*

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements


General Catalog of Old Books and Authors

http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm

which now indexes 24,000 books available free online, including all
PG(US) & PG(Aus)'s books, along with some basic date information
about them and their authors where you can find more.

Plus many books not available on line, a good place to search
for books by specific authors who you are interested in.

For information please contact Philip Harper
&lt;webmaster AT kingkong.demon.co.uk&gt;

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is an experimental online reader available.
Start from any bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject

and

The PG bittorrent tracker is up and running.
Aaron Cannon has placed the CD and DVD there if anyone wants to test.
You can access it by visiting

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.
We have regular need for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby AT pglaf.org&gt; ,

*Project Gutenberg Consortia Center Report

The PGCC collection at http://www.gutenberg.cc has doubled
in size from the listings below, but we don't have exactly
matching collection sizes yet for a new breakdown.

There are ~185,000 separate downloadable files,
and presuming 45% are reduntant or are required
at the level of more than one file per book:

The number of individual eBooks now is about 100,000.

Thus the grand total of eBooks at Project Gutenberg
is 21,000+ created by Project Gutenberg volunteers,
and 100,000 donated from over 125 other eLibraries,
to create a downloadble library of 100,000+ eBooks

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES



Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars Worth or a Trillion eBooks Yet???

6,552,689,891
65,526,899
If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,552,689,891 that would be 21,611 x 65,526,899 = ~1.42 Trillion !!!

With 21,611 eBooks online as of October 25, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.71 from each book.
[1% world population x #eBooks] 65,526,899 x 21,611 x $.71 = ~$1 Trillion

[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]


A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.47 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 21,611 eBooks online as of October 25, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.46 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.57 when we had 17,405 eBooks a year ago.

[This is not counting the 100,000 eBooks at http://gutenberg.cc which are
counted and maintained separately by their donating electronic libraries]

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100 million people.

Next Decade's Target:  15% Of The world Population = 1 billion !!! people.


At 21,611 eBooks in 35 Years and 03.75 Months We Averaged
       558 Per Year
        46 Per Month
         1.53 Per Day

At 3469 eBooks Done In The 295 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
      12 Per Day
      82 per Week
     356 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 299M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 80% the way to 300M, so
it will probably be 2 more weeks to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

*

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


U.S. ROLLS OUT E-PASSPORTS
After lengthy delays resulting from security concerns, the United
States has begun issuing passports equipped with RFID tags. The tags,
which transmit data including the passport holder's photo and
signature, are susceptible to illicit scanners that "skim" the
information from unsuspecting individuals, according to those opposed
to e-passports. The U.S. State Department said it has implemented
measures to address security concerns, including a metallic mesh woven
into the cover of the passport that "makes it nearly impossible to
access the chip when the book is closed." Additionally, starting this
week, all U.S. points of entry will have equipment to read and process
information in e-passports issued by the more than two dozen countries
in the Visa Waiver Program. All of those countries issue e-passports,
and visitors from those nations are not required to obtain a visa to
enter the United States. Critics said U.S. authorities have not
addressed the problems associated with e-passports. Kevin Mahaffey of
security firm Flexilis wrote a report indicating that despite the mesh
in the cover, the passports can still be read if they are open "even a
fraction of an inch."

JUDGE REFUSES TO DISABLE SPAMHAUS
A judge in Illinois has rejected a petition by e360 Insight to force
the closure of the Internet domain of antispam company Spamhaus. Last
month, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
ordered Spamhaus to pay e360 Insight $11.7 million in damages for
blacklisting the company, which keeps users of Spamhaus's antispam
list from accepting messages from the e360 Insight domain. Following
that ruling, e360 Insight asked the court to suspend the spamhaus.org
domain, but Judge Charles Kocoras rejected that request. Blocking the
Spamhaus domain, he said, would prevent the company from engaging in
activities that the court considers legitimate and would be unduly
severe. For its part, Spamhaus insists that e360 Insight is in fact a
spammer. Spamhaus, which is based in the United Kingdom, has also said
it is under no obligation to pay the fine imposed by the Illinois court
because that court has no jurisdiction over Spamhaus's actions.

ETS ANNOUNCES RESULTS OF INFORMATION LITERACY TEST
Results from the Educational Testing Service (ETS) indicate generally
poor performance on the organization's new test, the ICT Literacy
Assessment Core Level. ETS introduced the test to measure how
information literate and computer savvy students are. The test was
administered to volunteers at 44 institutions, including high schools
and two- and four-year colleges. Of the roughly 3,000 college students
and 800 high school students who took the test, only 13 percent were
deemed information literate. Officials from ETS noted that because the
test is new, the results are not authoritative or thorough but indicate
important trends. In general, they said, students could identify
relatively credible information from databases and knew that
information from .com Web sites is likely to be less reliable than
information from a .gov or .edu site. Students generally could not,
however, discern bias in online content and were overly willing to
trust suspect material.

CORNELL OPENS COLLECTION TO MICROSOFT
Microsoft has announced two partners in its book scanning project,
which will compete with Google's controversial Book Search program.
Cornell University will allow Microsoft to scan its library collection,
and Kirtas Technologies will provide high-speed hardware for the
scanning. Unlike Google's program, Microsoft's Windows Live Book
Search will only scan books in the public domain or those whose
copyright owners have granted explicit permission. Librarians from
Cornell will select texts to be scanned and will oversee quality
control for the process. Kirtas claims that its scanning machines are
capable of digitizing 2,400 pages per hour and are gentler that human
hands with the books.

WIKIPEDIA COFOUNDER LAUNCHES NEW SITE
One of the founders of Wikipedia has announced a new online
encyclopedia that he hopes will embody the foundation of Wikipedia
while overcoming some of its shortcomings. Larry Sanger's new project,
called Citizendium, will use a number of tactics to elicit credible,
useful content from a community of volunteers while avoiding the kinds
of intentional distortions that have been a problem for Wikipedia. On
Citizendium, contributors must register with their real names, and a
team of editors will enforce a set of community rules. Sanger said that
Wikipedia is an "amazing" resource but believes that "an even better
massive encyclopedia" can be produced by overlaying a system of "gentle
controls" on how content is developed and edited. The creation of
Citizendium will involve a "fork" of the existing Wikipedia content.
All current content from Wikipedia will serve as the basis for
Citizendium. From there, the two collections will evolve and diverge
based on their different approaches.

STUDY SHOWS EVIDENCE OF WEB ADDICTION
A study conducted by researchers at Stanford University indicates
considerable and rising rates of Internet addiction among U.S. users.
The study, which asked more than 2,500 people about their Web habits,
found that almost 14 percent said it was difficult to be offline for
more than a few days. Eight percent said they use the Internet as a
means to escape the real world, and a similar portion admitted to
hiding their Web habits from their partners. Researchers said these
kinds of behaviors are not unlike those exhibited by people with
problems such as alcoholism. According to the study, the profile of a
typical user who has problems with Internet addiction is a single,
college-educated, white male who spends more than 30 hours per week
using the Internet for "non-essential" purposes. Elias Aboujaoude, one
of the researchers in the study, said that it is important to remind
ourselves that despite all the benefits of technology, "it creates real
problems for a subset of people." Indeed, six percent of the
respondents said their addiction had adversely affected their
relationships with other people.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

Obviously the greatest headline news being avoided this week
by the major US media is the free press rating list of the
"Reporters Without Borders" based in Paris, France, since the
US has consistently fallen from its initial top 10% ranking
of 17th when the list started down to 53rd this year.

I did LOTS of search integration this morning and came up
with the following compilation from numerous sources, who
obviously dealt with tie scores in different ways, then,
if you want to skip my own compilation, I finally found
the entire listing, but without explanator notes as to
the scoring, which is included.

Paris-based Reporters Without Borders.


The US continues to fall from its initial 17th place,
edge of top 10%, to 53rd, edge of top 1/3, due to the
practice of jailing reporters for political reasons--
Joshua Wolf, who refused to yield a videotape of some
political protestors to a grand jury, not to mention,
of course, the whole Valerie Plame thing about a fake
weapons of mass destruction report concerning Iraq in
which a reporter spent her next half year in jail.

In addition, Sudanese cameraman Sami al-Haj who works
for Al-Jazeera has been held in Guantanamo since June
of 2002 without being charged and an Associated Press
photographer named Bilal Hussein is being held in the
Iraq jails by the US since April.

"National Security" and "The War On Terrorism" trumps
freedom of the press according to many reports.

Denmark dropped from tied for 1st to 19th because the
Mohammed cartoons were given a very bad time and some
police protection was required for the journalists.

DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

US Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert versus
those who say they told him about Rep. Foley.

/

"We will no longer say `We will stay the course.'"


*QUOTES OF THE WEEK

The above does well engouth.


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Halliburton will be found to have crossed many lines
clearly demarked, concerning where the billions went
and the hiring of coerced and indentured laborers.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

The Reporters Without Borders should get all the credit.

/

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
is obviously no longer 6% of the world.  In fact, rounding to the
nearest percent, the US will soon fall from 5% to 4%.]

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
