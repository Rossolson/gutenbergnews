  Results from the Educational Testing Service (ETS) indicate generally poor performance on the organization's new test, the ICT Literacy Assessment Core Level. ETS introduced the test to measure how information literate and computer savvy students are. The test was administered to volunteers at 44 institutions, including high schools and two- and four-year colleges. Of the roughly 3,000 college students and 800 high school students who took the test, only 13 percent were deemed information literate. Officials from ETS noted that because the test is new, the results are not authoritative or thorough but indicate important trends. In general, they said, students could identify relatively credible information from databases and knew that information from .com Web sites is likely to be less reliable than information from a .gov or .edu site. Students generally could not, however, discern bias in online content and were overly willing to trust suspect material.
