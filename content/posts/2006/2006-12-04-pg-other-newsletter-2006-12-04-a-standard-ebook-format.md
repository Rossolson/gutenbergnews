Subject: [PW]  A Standard eBook Format? - A Graduate Research Survey

My name is Edward Goas, and my graduate advisor has recommended that I ask for the assistance of librarians as I seek out information regarding digital books, or eBooks. I am pursuing a Master's degree in Technology Management at the University of Advancing Technology in Arizona. This survey will be used to forecast the success of a proposed eBook standard file format and whether a standard eBook format will solve any existing issues.

Estimated completion time of the survey is 5 minutes. Feel free to leave any answers blank and submit an incomplete survey. For those interested, I will happily provide my data and thesis upon its completion to anyone who submits a survey. I?ll provide it in any format you?d like.

The survey can be found at:

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks in advance to those who participate!

Sincerely,
Edward Goas
