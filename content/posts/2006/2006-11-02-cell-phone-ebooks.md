  Cell phone technology is moving in leaps and bounds and the price is falling as all other computer technologies. Bandwidth between phones and the web is also increasing, but the number of users using the phone to browse the web is not increasing as it should be. This is due to the excessive price that most phone operators charge for the download of data from web to phone. If there<br /> is a download plan it is usually for a tiny amount of data such as 8MB per month.

  So as things stand now, phone WAP [Wireless Application Protocol] and Web browsing are limited to wealthy phone users only. This is a very sad fact because cell / mobile phones can be used to receive and send information from anywhere at anytime without having to have a power hungry computer in front of you running down those big batteries.The cheapest way to read on cell phones is by loading the documents straight to the phone from the computer using cable, bluetooth, or infra red ports, NOT to pay through the nose for online billing charges that wildly exceed the costs of the same number of converation minutes.
