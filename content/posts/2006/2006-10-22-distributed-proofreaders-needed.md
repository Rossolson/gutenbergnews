  Please visit the site: <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/">http://www.pgdp.net</a> for more information about how you can help a lot by simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed, and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it, please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the Project Gutenberg collection. To see what is already online, visit <a href="http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL">http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL</a> (a text file) listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?</strong>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> High-speed scanning requires destruction of the book(s) which will not be returned. We have high-speed scanners currently located in the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive and please check them against David’s “In Progress” list at: <a href="http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html">http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html</a> to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the ‘OK’
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don’t have the time or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Just send us email telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help find a project you would like to work on.
