    A new report from Eduventures suggests that the market for online education has considerable room to grow. In a survey of 2,000 people who are planning to enroll in college, 19 percent were interested in an online-only program, 18 percent in mostly online programs, and 14 percent in programs that offer equal time online and face-to-face. The data show that students just out of high school are most interested in a traditional college experience. As age rises, up to the 35-55 range, students are more interested in online education, reflecting working adults' need for the convenience of online classes. According to Richard Garrett, author of the report, online education has failed to remove geography as a factor in educational choices, defying predictions of just a few years ago. Even when considering online education, he said, most students still express a preference for a local campus, at least one that is in the state where they live.
