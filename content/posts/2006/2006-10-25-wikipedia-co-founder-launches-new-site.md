  One of the founders of Wikipedia has announced a new online encyclopedia that he hopes will embody the foundation of Wikipedia while overcoming some of its shortcomings. Larry Sanger's new project, called Citizendium, will use a number of tactics to elicit credible, useful content from a community of volunteers while avoiding the kinds of intentional distortions that have been a problem for Wikipedia. On Citizendium, contributors must register with their real names, and a team of editors will enforce a set of community rules. Sanger said that Wikipedia is an "amazing" resource but believes that "an even better massive encyclopedia" can be produced by overlaying a system of "gentle controls" on how content is developed and edited. The creation of Citizendium will involve a "fork" of the existing Wikipedia content.

  All current content from Wikipedia will serve as the basis for Citizendium. From there, the two collections will evolve and diverge based on their different approaches.
