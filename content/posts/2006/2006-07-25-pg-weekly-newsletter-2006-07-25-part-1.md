<pre>From hart at pglaf.org  Tue Aug  1 10:06:36 2006
From: hart at pglaf.org (Michael Hart)
Date: Tue Aug  1 10:06:38 2006
Subject: [gweekly] Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.60.0608011005290.26061@pglaf.org&gt;


this is both parts at once


This first portion is estimates of progress since the
last of the Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletters, and
a few of the figures are accurate, some just guesses,
but I need something to start counting from, when the
normal weekly progression starts tomorrow.

I may not get ALL the figures updated below as I have
only half an hour longer before Geek Lunch.

Michael



Last Week, July 25, 2006
18,870 US  +375
    909 AU  +159
    330 EU    +4
  8,825 DP  +151

20,477 GT  +377
[note that previously PGAu was included here, not now,
hence the numbers don't add up this time, but a future
counting formula should work this out.  I am advised a
number of the PGAu eBooks are also counted in those US
numbers in the cataloging process if the copyright was
OK in both countries.  Perhaps someday we can find the
right kind of person to reconcile these figures.]

Weekly_July_25.txt
***The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, July 25, 2006 PT1*
*******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971********

*
This is my first attempt at a Newsletter on a new system, so please bear with
me as I try to learn a whole new bag of tricks to get these things written up
in a way that doesn't take me a whole day for each one.

This file contains the data up to about July 25, what would have been in this
Newsletter a week ago, but some of the data will just be approximations since
not all the numbers are kept on a daily or weekly basis.

Please also let me know if you think these Newsletters are a waste of time or
if you think I/we should keep doing them.

Thanks!

Michael

      ***584 eBooks Averaged Per Year Since July 4, 1971***

             17,416 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~261 eBooks per Month for ~66.80 Months

            2,336 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

           151 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
            ~8,800 total from Distributed Proofreaders
              Since October, 2000 [Details in PT1B]
              [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]

        We Are Averaging ~343 eBooks Per Month This Year!!!
                [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 80.5 eBooks Per Week In 2006

It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our 1st 10,000 eBooks

It took ~12.5 years from Jan. 1994 to Jun. 2006 to go from 100 to 20,100

It took ~32 months, from 2003 to 2006 for our last 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to 20,000

[The above changes due to the opening of Project Gutenberg
sites other than the original one at www.gutenberg.org]
[Now including totals from Australia, Europe and PrePrints]
[Apologies, it will take a while to integrate everything
not all statistics may be totally equalized yet]
[Daily PGEu stats at http://dp.rastko.net/default.php]
[Daily DP stats at http://www.pgdp.net]

BTW, we just started a new "PrePrints" site at PG,
so if you come across eBooks that aren't ready for
primetime, but that should be saved for upgrading,
we have a place to put them.

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

75,000+ eBooks at the PG Consortia Center

***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements


General Catalog of Old Books and Authors

http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm

which now indexes 24,000 books available free online, including all
PG(US) & PG(Aus)'s books, along with some basic date information
about them and their authors where you can find more.

Plus many books not available on line, a good place to search
for books by specific authors who you are interested in.

For information please contact Philip Harper
&lt;webmaster AT kingkong.demon.co.uk&gt;

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is an experimental online reader available.
Start from any bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject

and

The PG bittorrent tracker is up and running.
Aaron Cannon has placed the CD and DVD there if anyone wants to test.
You can access it by visiting
http://snowy.arsc.alaska.edu:6969

We're building a team to read our eBooks into MP3 files
for the visually impaired and other audio book users.

Let us know if you'd like to join this group.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

***

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.
We have regular need for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby AT pglaf.org&gt; ,
if you can help.

This is much more important than many of us realize!

of 18 collections. . .with this week's listing as:

=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~34,286 Unique eBooks

*

The new overall collection size, which has reduced the
need to account for duplications and eBooks with files
for each chapter, etc.
                                  75,000+ Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 25,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,700 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Statistical Review

In the 29 weeks of this year, we have produced 2336 new eBooks.
It took us from 07/71 to 11/00 to produce our FIRST 2336 eBooks!!!

          That's 29 WEEKS as Compared to ~29 YEARS!!!


FLASHBACK!

Here's a sample of what books we were doing around eBook #2336

Mon Year Title and Author                                  [filename.ext] ###

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet?

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,531,968,950 that would be 20,484 x 65,319,690 = ~1.34 Trillion !!!

With 20,484 eBooks online as of July 25, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.75 from each book.
[1% world population x #eBooks] 6,531,968,95 x 20,102 x $.75 = ~$1 Trillion
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]
[By the way, the US "popclock" is about to turn to 300 million people.]
[Just turned 299 million last month!]

*
6,531,968,950
65,319,690

A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.49 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 20,484 eBooks online as of July 25, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.49 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.60 when we had 16,842 eBooks a year ago.

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100,000,000 people.


At 20,484 eBooks in 35 Years and 00.60 Months We Averaged
       580 Per Year
        48 Per Month
         1.60 Per Day

At 2336 eBooks Done In The 209 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
    11.2 Per Day
      78 per Week
     340 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 298M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 1/6 the way to 299M, so
it will probably be 10 more weeks to 299M and 22 more to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

*

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]



U.S. LEGISLATORS MOVE TO BAN SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES

[My own comments about such politicking are included below,
but here it is obviously that it is a "bad thing" to let an
ordinary society of teens take place if we can't watch over
them to make sure others aren't watching over them, too.]

A bill introduced by Rep. Michael Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) that aims to
restrict social networking Web sites in schools and libraries passed
the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 410-15. The Deleting
Online Predators Act (DOPA) would require organizations that receive
funds under the federal E-Rate program to install Internet filters that
would block access to sites such as Facebook and MySpace. The FCC would
be responsible for defining what sites would be covered by the law.
According to the American Library Association (ALA), about two-thirds
of U.S. libraries would be subject to the law. Supporters of the
legislation said that children who use such Web sites become targets of
sexual predators. Opponents of the law said it is overly broad and
would prevent computer users from accessing a number of unrelated
sites, such as Amazon, blogs, wikis, and even news sites. Leslie
Burger, president of the ALA, said, "DOPA is redundant and unnecessary
legislation," noting that the Children's Internet Protection Act
already requires institutions to block Web content considered harmful
to children. The bill now goes to the Senate.

MTV ENTERS SOCIAL NETWORKING GAME
MTV is introducing a new cable channel and Web site designed to take
advantage of the immense popularity of social networking software.
Sites such as MySpace (which was recently purchased by Rupert Murdoch),
YouTube, and Bebo have large numbers of loyal users who go to the sites
to find others with similar interests, share content, and communicate
with friends through various means. MTV's social networking entry,
Flux, will combine online tools with a cable channel, allowing users to
select the videos that they see on the channel, upload multimedia
files, and talk with other users. The site also lets users interact
through avatars--animated figures that represent individual users. An
official from MTV said Flux puts control in the hands of users,
"challenging the status quo in TV programming."

PROVOSTS BACK OPEN ACCESS TO PUBLIC RESEARCH
An open letter signed by the provosts of 25 universities supports
passage of the Federal Public Research Access Act, which would require
federal agencies to publish their research findings online and free
within six months of publication elsewhere. Publishers, including
scholarly associations, oppose the bill, claiming that it could
endanger research and threaten many journals. The provosts' letter
encourages higher education to consider changing the way research
findings are disseminated while acknowledging that the bill would force
publishers and scholarly societies to consider significant shifts in
their publishing approach.

GOOGLE LAUNCHES SITE CATERING TO VISUALLY IMPAIRED
A new service from Google Labs promises easier searching for users with
visual impairments. Web sites full of graphics and animations are fine
for sighted users, but screen readers and other technologies that
assist the blind or visually impaired have considerable difficulty
rendering such sites in a way that can easily be understood. The new
service, called Google Accessible Search site, will evaluate how easily
assistive technologies are likely to be able to parse and present the
content of a Web page and moves those sites higher in the listing of
search results. According to T.V. Raman, research scientist in charge
of the service, the service is an "early-stage experiment" that he
hopes can be further developed and refined based on user feedback.

INDIA CLAMPS DOWN ON BLOGS
The Indian government has ordered the country's 153 ISPs to block
access to 17 Web sites, some of them blogs, causing an outcry among the
country's bloggers. The government issued a directive in 2003 noting
that it has the authority to restrict Web sites if they are deemed
threatening to the state or its relationship with other countries or
could potentially incite crime. The blogging community in India has
reacted strongly, criticizing the government for censoring free speech.
One blogger, Amit Agarwal, said his country has "joined the Internet
Filtering Club of China, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Ethiopia." Others
expressed fears that the government is trying to restrict all blogs in
the country, a charge the government denied.

CHINA SENDS INTERNET REPORTER TO PRISON
Chinese courts have convicted another individual of using the Internet
to distribute content deemed inappropriate and subversive. Li Yuanlong
was accused of writing essays critical of unemployment and rural
poverty and e-mailing them to Chinese-language news outlets based in
the United States. Charges filed in February against Li said the essays
"fabricated, distorted and exaggerated facts, incited subversion of the
state, and [sought] to overthrow the socialist system." The court found
Li guilty and sentenced him to two years in prison. Li's lawyer noted
that although he believes the ruling was unjust, the sentence could
have been much longer. Similar charges in other cases have resulted in
prison terms of five and even ten years for those found guilty.

CHINESE AUTHORITIES TO TIGHTEN CONTROL OF INTERNET ACCESS
Chinese authorities, keen to exert considerable control over access
inside the country to online content it finds objectionable, has
announced plans to increase restrictions on Internet and cell-phone
technologies. Among the proposals is a requirement that users of cell
phones would have to register themselves. Currently, Chinese citizens
can use cell phones anonymously, which allows many millions to access
and share information that would otherwise be prohibited by the
government. Search engines are another likely target for tightened
control. Despite recent agreements with major search engines operating
in the country, "more and more harmful information is being circulated
online," according to Cai Wu, director of the Information Office of the
State Council. The planned crackdown riled many Chinese bloggers, but
others, including Wang Yi, law professor at Chengdu University, were
more optimistic. Wang noted that each generation of new technologies
has been censored by government authorities but that new tools continue
to appear, staying one or two years ahead of the restrictions.

ACADEMICS SNEAK PAST CHINESE FIREWALL
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered a way to
circumvent the firewall operated by the Chinese government and also to
use it to launch denial-of-service attacks. Chinese authorities
implemented the firewall to try to prevent computer users in the
country from accessing any information deemed inflammatory by the
government. According to Richard Clayton of the university's computer
lab, the firewall allows packets in and out of the country, but, when a
packet contains prohibited information, the firewall initiates a reset,
which causes the connection between the sending and receiving computers
to fail. "If you drop all the reset packets at both ends of the
connection, which is relatively trivial to do," said Clayton, "the Web
page is transferred just fine." At the same time, spoofed return
addresses for Internet transmissions will cause the firewall to
temporarily block traffic to and from those computers. Clayton noted
that even with a single dial-up connection, a hacker could create a
very disruptive attack. The researchers have reported their findings to
the Chinese Computer Emergency Response Team.

LAWSUIT ALLEGES COLLUSION IN CHIP MARKET

[Didn't you wonder why RAM chips didn't go down as other chips did?
34 states' attorneys general wonder why, too. . .price fixing??]

Attorneys general in 34 states, led by California's Bill Lockyer, have
filed a suit alleging that seven makers of dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) chips conspired to artificially inflate prices between 1998 and
2002. The lawsuit contends that the companies named fixed prices,
limited supplies, and rigged bids for the chips. Makers of consumer
products that use DRAM chips, including most computer manufacturers,
were forced to pay inflated prices and passed those extra costs on to
consumers, according to the complaint. A federal investigation launched
in 2002 into chipmakers' practices resulted in fines totaling hundreds
of millions of dollars for the world's leading chipmakers. The current
suit was filed in California because that is the home of many of the
computer makers directly affected by the alleged scheme.

RICE PRESS REBORN AS ONLINE ONLY

[I remember when Rice was one of the most conservative about such matters]

Rice University will restart its press, which was closed in 1996, as an
online-only operation, publishing peer-reviewed books and monographs.
Faced with declining budgets, many libraries buy fewer books, leaving
academic publishers unwilling to publish books unless they can justify
the printing costs. Rice's model does away with printing, allowing the
press to publish texts not published otherwise while considerably
speeding up the publishing process. Because texts will be
peer-reviewed, organizers hope the reborn Rice press will be as
prestigious--and as valid for tenure or promotion--as a traditional
press. The press will operate through Connexions, a site that offers
course materials free of charge. Separately, Connexions will also begin
offering print-on-demand custom textbooks, assembled from individual
modules within Connexions. The textbooks are expected to cost
significantly less than comparable offerings from traditional textbook
publishers.

SQUABBLE OVER CELL PHONES IN SCHOOL GOES TO COURT
Parents of public school kids in New York City have filed a lawsuit to
overturn a ban on cell phones in schools. The ban, which was originally
put in place in 1988 and concerned primarily pagers, was not widely
enforced until recently, when schools added X-ray machines to help keep
schools safe. Under the ban, cell phones can be confiscated and only
returned to parents, who must go to the school to pick them up. Parents
objected, saying cell phones represent a safety issue for kids and that
the chancellor of schools overstepped his authority in banning the
devices. School officials said students use cell phones for cheating,
making drug deals, taking photos in locker rooms, and other
inappropriate activities. The parents hoping to overturn the ban are
looking to a case from the early 1990s in which the courts ruled that
the school system went beyond its authority in distributing condoms to
students. The argument, which the court accepted, was that such
activity is properly under the purview of parents, not the school.
Opponents of the cell phone ban contend that having a cell phone is
similarly the decision of parents rather than school administrators.

PENTAGON ACKNOWLEDGES MONITORING STUDENT E-MAIL
Surveillance reports obtained through the Freedom of Information Act
indicate that the Department of Defense monitored student e-mail as
part of its efforts to identify and track potential terrorist suspects.
The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network filed requests for the
information, and the reports released so far cover e-mail surveillance
at the State University of New York at Albany, Southern Connecticut
State University, the University of California at Berkeley, and William
Paterson University of New Jersey. Student e-mail was monitored when it
dealt with protests against the war in Iraq or against the military's
"don't ask, don't tell" program concerning gay and lesbian members of
the armed forces. Instances of monitoring were evidently prompted by
reports of suspicious behavior, but a Pentagon spokesperson would not
say who submitted the reports that led to the monitoring described in
the surveillance reports. Kermit Hall, president of SUNY-Albany, said
his institution is investigating the nature of the monitoring and how
it was conducted and would decide later how to proceed.

PARIS LOOKS TO INCREASE CITY ACCESS
The mayor of Paris has announced plans to significantly increase
Internet access in the city, through both wired and wireless channels.
Mayor Bertrand Delanoe said that the city will work with private
companies to establish a free Wi-Fi network across Paris by the end of
2007. The access points for the network would be located in parks,
squares, libraries, and other public areas. The city will also cut
taxes on fiber-optic cables in an effort to increase the availability
of high-speed connections to 80 percent of the city. Currently, 60
percent of Parisians have access to high-speed Internet, according to
Delanoe. Under the proposal, which Delanoe will submit to the city
council next week, fees for fiber-optic cable running through the
city's sewer system would fall by one-fourth. Additionally, companies
would be eligible for tax breaks as high as 90 percent on the first 400
meters of fiber-optic cabling that is installed to buildings that are
not currently connected to high-speed lines.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA



*DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

[This part from an earlier report, slightly modified. . .more below]

The Senate refused to repeal 100% of the estate tax that had been
vilified as "The Death Tax," by embattled White House guru Karl Rove,
but in the end it will cost the real taxpayers just as much, as the
deal is being engineered by repealing what may be all timber company
taxes to win over Senate votes from timber rich Washington State.

All in all The Estate Tax is being repealed for all but the richest
1% or less in the country, and it should be mentioned that that 1%
owns half of everything that can be owned in the United States.

Source:  The Washington Post

[I wonder how rest of the country would react to all this if that 1%
who own half of everything in the US actually lived on their blocks,
and owned half the land, half the cars, half the stock, bonds, cash,
boats, etc., while the next 1% owned half of what was left, the next
1% owned half of that, etc. . .leaving only a few percent for 90% of
the block's residents???]

[Meanwhile this week Congress approved a bill to finally increase an
entirely out of date minimum wage of $5.15 to $7.25 over three years
of phase in time, over objections from big business that this should
not be done because it would make the US non-competitive world-wide,
as they could not compete with globalization of sweatshop owners for
the world markets.  This was all in return for a quid pro quo voting
down estate taxes on the very wealthy.

It would appear that you can't get a vote for the common worker with
no return vote for the very rich in the current Congress.

In common parlance, this is known as

"robbing Peter to pay Paul."

For some reason this reminds me of our own local recycling tax, $24,
for a weekly pick up of certain materials, after years of politics--
including perhaps a million dollars in wasted money and productivity
on a "bottle bill" that was eventually passed by referendum, several
times for several areas, then voted on my multiple city council vote
taking after even more wasted time, then approved by one mayor, then
finally. . .after all that. . .the other mayor. . .having allowed us
to work through all those years of effort. . .

vetoed the bottle bill.

But we ended up with that $24 recycling tax and plastic bins for the
households to put out recycling materials in, bins that we never see
in use in front of the average house if you drive down the streets--
but we still have bottles littering more houses than use the bins.

See why I am apolitical to the point of being anti-political?

One last point. . .the Equal Rights Amendment. . . .

"Equality of rights under the law shall not be deined or abridged by
the United Sttes or by any state on account of sex."

That's the entire thing, other than two even shorter sentences for a
power to enforce and take effect. . . .

The Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced only 3 years after a
movement finally got women the right to vote in the United States.

35 states have ratified the amemdment.

The cost in money and time has been billions of dollars, if not from
all aspects a trillion dollars.

The text of the Equal Rights Amendment is simple. . . .

It's what is said ABOUT it that is not simple.

Some say that equal rights for too many is ruining the United States.

Just another reason to hate politicking.]

[Darn!  I thought I was done with politicking for the time being but
the radio just reminded me that we are going through a "prohibition"
stage with smoking that is becoming reminiscent of the "prohibition"
period concerning drinking.  This is particularly evident here, in a
state that proudly or not is the home of Al Capone, Roger Touhy, and
and host of other gangland legends involved in the prohibition era.

What is happening here is the same thing that happened with drinking
in that certain areas are becoming "dry" or "smoke free" with a wide
variety of laws prohibiting smoking.  However, where _I_ live, in an
odd community composed of two cities and a major university, the law
can get quite tricky when and if more than one jurisdiction takes an
action to enforce a law, which is usually the case, as follows.

Both city councils decided that smoking was a "bad thing" and should
be outlawed, at least in all locations they could manage.

However, due to "situational ethics" each community was afraid a law
passed by their city council but not by the other, would simply move
consumers. . .the God of any retail marketing society. . .to spend a
greater and greater proportion of their time in the other town and a
greater and greater proportion of their money. . .along with it.

This is particularly evident in some neighborhoods I have lived in--
where bars line one side of the street, while the other is dry, from
certainl laws that take effected here and there, and now and then.

The city councils were actively concerned with the same thing, and a
very public snafu ocurred when they couldn't get it together, read a
term equal to "conspiracy" but with no legal implications, since the
city councils are beyond that sort of thing.

However, eventually laws were passed that are supposed to shut down,
more or less, smoking within various city limits, including campus.

Obviously we will still see those adult delinquents still gathered a
bunch here and a bunch there, smoking furiously during coffee breaks
that may have the same effect when caffeine joins nicotine as banned
substances, since we never learned from alcohol prohibition.

No coffee.

No cigarettes.

No alcohol.

But wait, didn't they believe in having multiple wives?

They must be the most immoral of all!

[Ok. . .ok. . .more than enough about politics, and I do not want to
get into religion any more than I want to get into politics.  Having
made what I hope is a point about why, I retire from the scene until
something rears its ugly head that I can't ignore.]


*QUOTES OF THE WEEK

"We'll give you a ~$2 an hour pay raise over three years if you will
give us millions of dollars in tax cuts for the rich right now."


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

It will eventually be determined that there has been an overall
pattern of divulging the personal information of U.S. citizens,
as well as of the collection of information "above and beyond a
call of duty" by the United States since the start of the FBI,"
and well beyond the scope of the FBI.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

I interviewed a high level Washington source on location during
my tour of the East Coast and asked for just one thing I should
tell you that you won't find in the news media.

The answer?

"More people are dying than you know" in the various conflicts.

*

By the way, for those interested, the official U.S. population
estimates just passed 298 million, though many say estimations
of this nature leave out as much as 5% of the population, with
the obvious exclusion of the 11-12 million immigrant workers
now being mentioned so much in the news.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
is obviously no longer 6% of the world.  In fact, rounding to the
nearest percent, the US will soon fall from 5% to 4%.]

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
