  As part of its legal defense in a lawsuit over its book-scanning project, Google has sought information from other companies about similar projects. The lawsuit was brought by a group of publishers and the Authors Guild, alleging that Google violates their copyrights when it scans protected books. Amazon.com offers shoppers previews of books they are considering buying, and Yahoo and Microsoft are members of an alliance that is working to develop a vast online library, not unlike what Google is building with its Book Search program. Google believes that information about those efforts will bolster its defense.<br /> Following Amazon.com's refusal last month to provide Google with requested details, Yahoo has similarly declined to furnish Google with the information it seeks. In a letter explaining its decision, an attorney from Yahoo said, "There is simply no need for Google to be peering into the minds and computers of Yahoo employees."<em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 29 November 2006</em><br /> <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/1700AP_Yahoo_Google.html" target="_blank">http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/1700AP_Yahoo_Google.html</a>
