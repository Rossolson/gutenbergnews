    After lengthy delays resulting from security concerns, the United States has begun issuing passports equipped with RFID tags. The tags, which transmit data including the passport holder's photo and signature, are susceptible to illicit scanners that "skim" the information from unsuspecting individuals, according to those opposed to e-passports. The U.S. State Department said it has implemented measures to address security concerns, including a metallic mesh woven into the cover of the passport that "makes it nearly impossible to access the chip when the book is closed." Additionally, starting this week, all U.S. points of entry will have equipment to read and process information in e-passports issued by the more than two dozen countries in the Visa Waiver Program. All of those countries issue e-passports, and visitors from those nations are not required to obtain a visa to enter the United States. Critics said U.S. authorities have not addressed the problems associated with e-passports. Kevin Mahaffey of security firm Flexilis wrote a report indicating that despite the mesh in the cover, the passports can still be read if they are open "even a fraction of an inch."
