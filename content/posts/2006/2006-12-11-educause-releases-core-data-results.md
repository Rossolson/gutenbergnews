    EDUCAUSE has released results from its annual Core Data Service survey, which questions higher education information technology leaders about various aspects of IT on campus. According to the results, the percentage of colleges and universities that choose to contract any of several IT functions to outside vendors rose for the second straight year, to 57 percent, up from 53 percent last year. Other notable changes included a rise in the percentage of institutions that have deployed wireless connectivity on campus, particularly in libraries, and a rise in the percentage of campuses that have undertaken an assessment of computer security. Greater proportions of colleges said they track bandwidth usage this year than last year, and campuses also saw a rise in the number that installed ERP systems.
