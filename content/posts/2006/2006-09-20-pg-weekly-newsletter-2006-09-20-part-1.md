The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, September 20, 2006 PT1
*******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971*******

Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com

I'm likely to send this out a little early this week, just in case, as my
connection has gotten flaky a few times while editing this, and I am not
sure it will be good enough for fine tuning, not that I insist on a fine
tuning, you'll notice that I use statistics from several sources that
do not agree. . .even the counting of our eBook is off by a couple.


GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL! at the New York Musical Theater Festival
By Anthony King and Scott Brown. Directed by Dave Mowers.
Starring Chris Fitzgerald ("Wicked" / "Fully Committed"),
Jeremy Shamos ("The Rivals" / "Reckless") and Matt Castle
(John Doyle's "Company")

Johann Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1450. So Bud
Davenport and Doug Simon wrote a musical about him and they're
bringing it to Broadway. They don't have a cast, a budget, or a
producer . . . but they have a dream!

"A surefire hit ... it's so bang on the money that, were I a
speculative type, I'd almost be tempted to invest," The Daily Telegraph.

Gutenberg! The Musical! is Bud and Doug's backers' audition: a
tuneful, tasteless triumph, celebrating the monstrous success of
their idiocy. Since its sold-out January premiere in London,
performed by the authors, we've been polishing the script and
writing new songs. Now - with a fantastic creative team and hugely
talented new cast - we're bringing it home to New York.

"Utterly brilliant ... the funniest and cleverest spoof I've come
across ... Mel Brooks couldn't have done it better," Clive Davis.

Venue: Sage Theatre (711 7th Avenue, at Times Square).
6 performances only: Fri 22nd Sept (8pm), Mon 25th (4.30pm),
Wed 27th (8pm), Thu 28th (8pm) and Sat 30th (1pm and 4.30pm).
Running time: 90 minutes.

Tickets: $20.00.

To book: call 212-352-3101 or visit
http://www.nymf.org/index.php?module=ShowManager&func=display&sid=497


"Contains more wit and intelligence than three decades of megashows,"

Five Stars! The Times.

For now I am leaving PT1a and PT1b combined.

Please also let me know if you think these Newsletters are a waste of
time or if you think I/we should keep doing them.

Thanks!

Some Suggestions We Received For The Newsletters


0.
Several people have merely suggested to other readers
that they start from both ends and read to the middle
and thus they will get the highlights first, and then
the regular features, requests, etc. that stay pretty
much the same from issue to issue.

I would agree with this suggestion, and would simply,
for my own edification, also read the "Flashback," as
I find it interesting to see Project Gutenberg eBooks
as they appeared in our catalog x years ago.


1.
Divide the Newsletter in Web page URLs so the readers
could just jump to whatever portions they wanted.
[This would take some additional labor by someone who
was more familiar with writing web pages than I.]

You should already be able to jump to whichever parts
you want to read. . .simply use your search commands,
search for "*" plus the section header as outlined in
The Table of Contents.


2.
Redivide PT1 of the Weekly Newsletter into two parts.

[This would create a lot more work for whomever edits
the Newsletters, which probably wouldn't be so bad if
that were their only responsibility.  I work to point
of exhaustion nearly every single day, and I need for
things to become easier rather than harder.  Hence my
requests for anyone who would like to be editor:  the
format of the Newsletter would be their choice and we
could either turn over the statistics to them, or our
stats people could simply send in that portion, ahead
of the deadline by an hour or two.  We would continue
to encourage our readers to send in news items not in
the main regular media coverage.]


*

We are interested in increasing the "SF" available at Project Gutenberg of
Australia. To this end we are happy to receive donations of ebooks to add
to our collection.

SF, in this context can mean: Science, Speculative, Superhero, Swords,
Sorcery, Spies, Supernatural and Scary Fiction.

Of course, we are only able to accept works that are public domain in
Australia.

Generally speaking, this means that the author died in 1954 or earlier.

Please see our WANTED list at http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html for
authors and works of interest. If you have suggestions for authors or
works to add to the list, please let us know.  Do check first that
they are not already available at Project Gutenberg Australia or
Project Gutenberg, please.  Contact details are provided on the WANTED page.

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

As always, ebooks by Australian authors and of general Australian interest
are always greatly appreciated.

               [Please note we have several counting methods,
               and they often differ by several book that we
               have to hunt down by hand to reconcile.]
               [Pleast note there is some duplication between
               these various collections.  Volunteers needed
               to take these duplications into account.]

                ~13% of the way from 20,000 to 30,000

               80,000+ eBooks at the PG Consortia Center
               http://www.gutenberg.cc   [160,000 files]

[Please note that the four collections totals are eBooks that originated
as created, edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and
its 50,000 volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with
80,000+ eBooks contains entire eBook collections from 100+ eLibraries so
the production statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created
by the various teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share
the responsibility of maintaining.  The Consortia Center eBooks were and
are the responsibility of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy
to forward any suggestions for correction to those eLibraries, but those
eBooks must be edited by the donating parties, as per their requests.]

             18,242 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~266 eBooks per Month for ~68.50 Months

            3,162 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

            28 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
              9,066 total from Distributed Proofreaders
              Since October, 2000 [Details in PT1B]
              [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]
            [Note, PGDP mostly included in US eBooks]
         [Note, PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders
          whose total closely matches their grand total]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]


       We Are Averaging ~372 eBooks Per Month This Year!!!
              [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 85 eBooks Per Week In 2006
                        99 This Week
                       121 Last Week
                       220 This Month [Sep]

[Aug. was one of those months with 5 Wednesdays; our work week
runs from about noon Wednesday, Eastern Time Zone, for 7 days]


It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our 1st 10,000 eBooks

It took ~12.5 years from Jan. 1994 to Jun. 2006 to go from 100 to 20,100

It took ~32 months, from 2003 to 2006 for our last 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to 20,000

It took ~2.3 years from Jan. 2004 to Aug. 2006 from 11,000 to 21,000

Not counting the addition of The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center

*

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

General Catalog of Old Books and Authors

http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm

which now indexes 24,000 books available free online, including all
PG(US) & PG(Aus)'s books, along with some basic date information
about them and their authors where you can find more.

Plus many books not available on line, a good place to search
for books by specific authors who you are interested in.

For information please contact Philip Harper
&lt;webmaster AT kingkong.demon.co.uk&gt;

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is an experimental online reader available.
Start from any bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics

*Project Gutenberg Consortia Center Report

The PGCC collection at http://www.gutenberg.cc has doubled
in size from the listings below, but we don't have exactly
matching collection sizes yet for a new breakdown.

There are ~160,000 separate downloadable files,
and presuming 50% are reduntant or are required
at the level of more than one file per book:

The number of individual eBooks now is about 80,000.

Thus the grand total of eBooks at Project Gutenberg
is 21,000+ created by Project Gutenberg volunteers,
plus 80,000 donated from over 100 other eLibraries,
to create a downloadble library of 100,000+ eBooks

=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~34,286 Unique eBooks

*

The new overall collection size, which has reduced the
need to account for duplications and eBooks with files
for each chapter, etc.
                                  80,000+ Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 25,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 6,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES



Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet?

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,545,310,397 that would be 21,310 x 65,453,104 = ~1.39 Trillion !!!

With 21,310 eBooks online as of September 20, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.72 from each book.
[1% world population x #eBooks] 65,453,104 x 21,310 x $.72 = ~$1 Trillion
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]
[By the way, the US "popclock" is about to turn to 300 million people.]
[Just turning 299.8 million this week!]



A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.47 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 21,310 eBooks online as of September 20, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.47 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.58 when we had 17,167 eBooks a year ago.

[This is not counting the ~80,000 eBooks at http://gutenberg.cc which are
counted and maintained separately by their donating electronic libraries]

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100 million people.

Next Decade's Target:  15% Of The world Population = 1 billion !!! people.


At 21,310 eBooks in 35 Years and 02.50 Months We Averaged
       605 Per Year
        50 Per Month
         1.66 Per Day

At 3162 eBooks Done In The 259 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
    12.2 Per Day
      85 per Week
     372 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 299M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 80% the way to 300M, so
it will probably be 2 more weeks to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

*

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

RESEARCHERS ANNOUNCE NEW CHIP TECHNOLOGY
Researchers at Intel and the University of California, Santa Barbara,
have developed a new kind of computer chip that transfers data between
chips using lasers instead of wires, which have long been a bottleneck
in computing. Fiber-optic technology allows data to travel very fast
over long distances, but data-transfer rates remain a function of how
quickly data can travel over wires from chip to chip. The new
technology combines a silicon-based processor with a layer of
light-emitting indium phosphide. The result, said researchers, could be
an astounding increase in the speed at which data can travel. Such a
breakthrough could allow computer scientists to rethink how computers
fundamentally work and what they are capable of. For example, the new
chips, which could cost a few dollars, could deliver data-transmission
speeds 100 times faster than today's optical transceivers, which cost
several thousand dollars. The new technology is not expected to make
its way into commercial products before the end of the decade.

COURT IN BELGIUM ORDERS GOOGLE TO STOP REPOSTING NEWS
A Belgian court has ordered Google to stop using news stories from a
number of French-language newspapers on its Web site. An organization
called Copiepresse, which manages copyright for French and German
newspapers in Belgium, had complained that Google does not ask
permission to use the papers' content, nor does it reimburse the
papers, even though Google sells advertising and makes money from the
content it posts on its site. The court agreed and ordered Google to
stop using the disputed news articles. If Google does not comply, it
will be subject to a fine of US$1.3 million per day. Margaret Boribon,
general secretary for Copiepresse, said she would inform other news
organizations in Europe of the decision, which might allow them to
pursue similar injunctions in other markets.

NCSU PROFESSOR SUSPENDS SALES OF LECTURES
A communication professor at North Carolina State University (NCSU) has
suspended his practice of selling audio recordings of his lectures over
the Web after administrators raised questions about the practice.
Robert Schrag had been selling lectures since August for $2.50 each
through a Web site called Independent Music Online. Despite having
received approval from the head of his department to sell the lectures,
Schrag agreed to stop selling the MP3 files, at least temporarily,
after Toby Parcel, dean of the College of Humanities and Social
Sciences, expressed concerns about the appropriateness of the practice.
At NCSU, faculty own the course materials they produce, but some
students had objected to Schrag's selling his lectures, saying that
they should be available free for students. Schrag disagreed, saying
that tuition for the course does not necessarily cover such materials
as recordings of lectures. He said the recordings are intended for
motivated students who want to review materials after class, students
for whom English is not their first language and would benefit from
hearing lectures again, and students who would rather skip class.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK


I suppose at least some of the mention hasa to go to Pope
Benedict for his non-apology apologies.


*QUOTES OF THE WEEK

Pope Benedict said,

"Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there
you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command
to spread by the sword the faith he preached."

However, he was actually quoting a Christian Emperor from around
the times of The Crusades, though I know know which one.

[I found one reference to the Byzantine Emperor Manual II]


Later the Pope apologized for the effect of his comments,
but apparently not for making them, tho I can't find all
the exact words he used.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

The US population will hit 300 million in the next few weeks.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

1/6 of the entire United States GDP is health care,
yet the United States is the ONLY developed country
without a universal health care program. 47 million
are totally uninsured, out of 300 million.
*

By the way, for those interested, the official U.S. population
estimates just passed 299 million, though many say estimations
of this nature leave out as much as 5% of the population, with
the obvious exclusion of the 11-12 million immigrant workers
now being mentioned so much in the news.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
is obviously no longer 6% of the world.  In fact, rounding to the
nearest percent, the US will soon fall from 5% to 4%.]

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
