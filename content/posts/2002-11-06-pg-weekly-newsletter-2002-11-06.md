Requests For Assistance:



CIA FACT BOOK READY FOR FORMATTING  [Third Request]

The 2002 edition of the CIA World Fact Book is now
available at http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html
Project Gutenberg needs a volunteer to harvest and reformat
this work into plain text (HTML is optional).  See our previous
WFB's for formatting idea.  Interested?  Email gbnewby@ils.unc.edu

***

Second Request for Alice

If we could get a volunteer to scan them in a similarly large size
to the other Alice illustrations, then I could have a go at producing
an illustrated version of "Through the Looking Glass".
[This would require scanning about 50 illustrations]

***

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Third Request!

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the first 44 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,975 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,269 eTexts online as of Nevember 6, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.60 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.45 when we had 4006 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.85 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

MIT, HP UNVEIL DIGITAL LIBRARY
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Hewlett-Packard have taken
the wraps off DSpace -- a new system for electronically archiving books,
lecture notes and scientific data created by research institutions. MIT and
HP hope that the DSpace project will lead to the creation of a virtual
library that combines the collections of multiple research universities,
and MIT is already in discussions with Cambridge and Cornell to link their
libraries to the DSpace system. Corporations and government agencies have
also been in contact with MIT, says DSpace project director Mackenzie
Smith. Eventually, MIT's system, which currently can hold two terabytes of
data, will contain more than a petabyte, or a quadrillion bytes of data.
The project began about 18 months ago in response to the increasingly
unwieldy volume of data that universities must catalog and preserve. "Part
of the reason for doing this is that the faculty says, 'My stuff is too
hard to find.' ^EWe began this to get some kind of territorial control over
all of this research," says Smith. "If you're lucky, you can get some of it
on Google, but most of the stuff we are talking about is not indexed in any
way you can get it." (CNet News.com 4 Nov 2002)

Headlines From Edupage

EU, AFRICAN NONPROFIT LOOK TO LINUX
System integrator Netproject, a UK-based company, won a contract last
week from the European Union to study the feasibility of moving some
member countries' operating systems to Linux. Currently the countries
use Microsoft operating systems, but many involved have come to regard
Microsoft's pricing and short upgrade cycles as too expensive.
Separately, SchoolNet Namibia, a nonprofit trying to bring technology
to schools in Namibia, rejected an offer from Microsoft to switch to
Windows from Linux. A letter from the organization criticized the
software maker for suggesting that the nonprofit pay $9,000 for Windows
XP, even while offering a discount on Office. The two announcements
came as a number of Microsoft customers have raised concerns about
cost, pointing to open-source alternatives as significantly cheaper. A
spokesman from Microsoft argued that when all costs of ownership are
considered, open-source is not necessarily cheaper than Microsoft.
ZDNet, 4 November 2002
http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-964310.html

UC SANTA BARBARA BANS TWO VERSIONS OF WINDOWS
Campus officials at the University of California at Santa Barbara
issued a policy statement to students banning the use of Windows 2000
and Windows NT 4.0 operating systems on the school's network. The
statement blames the two operating systems for "hundreds of problems,"
some of which required temporarily shutting down the campus network. An
official from the university said that most of last year's security
lapses were traced to the 200 computers--of a total of 3,800 on the
network--that were running Windows 2000. A spokesman from Microsoft
said the university's problems stemmed from poor network management
rather than any problem with the operating systems. The university will
still allow certain systems to run Windows 2000, but only in
"controlled" environments where university officials can be certain
that the security settings are configured properly.
