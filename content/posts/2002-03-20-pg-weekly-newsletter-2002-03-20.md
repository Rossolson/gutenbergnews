- Requests And Announcements For Our Volunteers

New Site!

Frankfurt, Germany
ftp://pandemonium.tiscali.de/pub/gutenberg/
http://pandemonium.tiscali.de/pub/gutenberg/
The supporting organization is "Tiscali Business GmbH"
http://www.tiscali-business.de/ or http://www.tiscali.de/

*

We need volunteers to create some Project Gutenberg files
from the U. S. Census of 2000.

. . .

and in "life +50" countries to complete the works of
Edgar Rice Burroughs [Tarzan, the Mars series, etc.]

*

If any of you have any possible contacts with any of those
services that say they can "find anyone" please let me know.

*
It has been suggested that we should have a "PG Archivist"
collect the various Newsletters, Annoucements, and Articles
from our website and make them into an eBook. . . .  If you
would like to do this, or any of the other projects listed
here, please let me know.

*

As part of the changes required for Project Gutenberg to do
thousands of eBooks per year [yes, we are still on schedule
for this to be the first year we do two thousand] I need an
Executive Assistant.  Since I am currently only letting the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation send me a 1/8
portion of my salary, and not even cashing those checks, it
will start out as an upaid position, and if pay is needed I
will try to work it up to $10,000 per year.  This may be an
assignment best suited for someone in a major-metropolitan-
area who can get unlimited long distance service such as My
Blue Kiwi or something like that.  I *can* pay for that.  I
would guess a major part of the job would be contacting the
people and places we wish to send donation letters to.  The
job could be fun if you like talking to the rich & famous.

*

Speaking of sending out our donation letters, we have a few
people ready to send out about 100 letters per month, among
them, and we need help compiling mailing lists of:

Companies
  Computer 100
  Computer 200
  Fortune  500
  Fortune 1000
  Fortune 1500


Granting Foundations
  PBS List
  Top  100
  Top 1000
  Literacy Oriented:  Such As Coke's new initiative

Colleges and Universities
  Top  100
  Top 1000


Chambers of Commerce


Cities
Counties
States
Countries


If you would be able to help us prepare the mailing lists for
any of the above, please let me know.  There ARE just lists
already prepared in various electronic formats, and some may
be very inexpensive or free of charge, if we can find them.

*

We would like to prepare several different cover letters for
EACH of the categories, and then send each letter to perhaps
100 members of the relevant lists, and then track how well
they work so we can constantly improve them.

We also need to find grant writers, because most granting
agencies have their own particular ideal format for such.
I think we should send at least one cover letter to each
granting agency on our list, and wait for a reply before
we ask anyone to spend the time on writing any proposals,
as these proposals can be VERY time consuming. . ._I_ would
even have a second, more detailed cover letter to send them
asking for more detailed feedback and encouragement before
writing proposals. . .the people I know who write proposals
take a LOT of time and effort doing them, so I think we
should use these efforts very wisely. . .thus the two letters
we would like to send before asking anyone to take time time
to write a complete grant proposal.

DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory
B. Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;

- Information About Mirror Sites

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Choose a mirror of the Project
Gutenberg collection near you.

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

&lt;http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;
or
&lt;ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.

Note that updated etexts usually go in the original directory of
their assigned year of publication  (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 03/20/02**:  4,816
(This number includes the 56 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 11 weeks of the new year, we have produced 524 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1996 to produce our *FIRST* 524 eBooks!!!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,816 eTexts online as of March 20, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.08 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.04 when we had 3293 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.96 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 32% less a year later???

From Newsscan:

STATES PROTEST MICROSOFT'S MOTION FOR DISMISSAL
Thirty-four states have filed legal briefs protesting Microsoft's motion
for dismissal of its federal antitrust case on the grounds that individual
states should not dictate federal antitrust policy. Microsoft lawyers have
argued that the nine state attorneys general who refused to accept the
settlement deal the software maker negotiated with the Justice Department
did not have legal standing to continue their litigation. Those original
nine states had rejected the settlement as too lenient and full of
loopholes, and have now been joined in their objections by 25 other states
in a surprise filing that argues that previous legislation grants them
authority to continue a case, even when the federal government proposes to
settle. Microsoft continues to have high hopes it will prevail in getting
the case dismissed altogether: "Our argument is based on jurisdiction and
federalism," says Microsoft's incoming general counsel, Brad Smith. "We are
saying that the nine states should not have the authority to impose a
sanction that would have a countrywide effect. It would be like saying that
Greece, Denmark and Ireland had the right to make law that would affect the
whole European Union." (Financial Times 17 Mar 2002)

[Actually, Germany made a copyright laws the affected the whole EU,
and took a million books out of the public domain back under copyright,
and even pressured the US into adding 20 more years of copyright]

[What Did I Say About Things Becoming "Pay-Per-Whatever"?]

WEB INCHES ALONG FROM FOR-FREE TO FOR-FEE
Although the vast majority of content on the Web is still free, an
increasing number of sites are requiring visitors to pay subscriber fees
for at least some of the content they're providing. NASCAR races are no
longer offered free on the Web, and recently ABC News has ended its free
video; now CNN has decided to phase out free video clips on its news,
sports, and financial sites. The general manager of CNN rival Foxsports.com
is sympathetic with CNN's decision: "I don't think the future is too far
off where most sites will turn off a lot of the freeness. The big companies
that support Web sites are going to take a very hard look -- can we afford
to continue losing $100 million to $150 million a year on this thing?" (USA

FCC NIXES MORE CABLE BROADBAND REGULATION
The Federal Communications Commission ruled that Internet access via
high-speed, interactive cable modems should be classified as an
"information service" rather than a "telecommunications service," a
decision that liberates cable companies from the more stringent common
carrier regulations that govern most telecom companies. The agency also
ruled that cable modems did not qualify as a "cable service," which
prevents local governments from creating and selling separate franchises
for cable ISPs or levying higher fees on cable companies that market
broadband services. Consumer groups protested the decision, saying that it
could lead to cable company control over pricing and over the content their
customers can receive via broadband. (Financial Times 14 Mar 2002)
http://news.ft.com/news/industries/internet&e-commerce

ICANN REJECTS BOARD MEMBER ELECTIONS
ICANN, the international nonprofit group that sets policy for the
Internet's "domain-naming" (i.e., addressing) system, has decided against
electing its board members by general elections, at least for the time
being. In an ICANN meeting in Ghana, board chairman Vinton Cerf said, "It
is obvious to all of us after carefully examining the issues that we're not
doing elections now" -- and ICANN chief executive Stuart Lynn said the
reason for the decision was that most board members feared general
elections could be marred by fraud and dominated by special interests.
Board member Karl Auerbach dissented vehemently from the group's decision:
"ICANN made a great leap backwards. It repudiated the compact on which it
was formed -- an agreement that ICANN would, being a public and tax-exempt
entity, allow the public to meaningfully participate." The acronym ICANN
stands for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. (AP/San
Jose Mercury News 14 Mar 2002)
http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/2861182.htm

[From previous articles it would appear ICANN might be in exactly the
categories it says should be kept out of possible board elections.]

[Hmmm. . .I wrote that earlier, but it appears I wasn't alone. . . .]

ICANN SUED BY ONE OF ITS BOARD MEMBERS
ICANN dissident board member Karl Auerbach is suing to gain access to the
group's travel records, payroll figures, and other information he says he
needs "to exercise independent judgment and fulfill my duties as director."
ICANN staff have refused to provide him that kind of information unless he
first signs a confidentiality agreement, but he has attacked them for being
secretive and unaccountable to millions of Internet members. In his
lawsuit, Auerbach is being represented by the civil-libertarian Electronic
Frontier Foundation. (Reuters/USA Today 18 Mar 2002)

NANOTECHNOLOGY USED FOR FUTURISTIC COMBAT UNIFORMS
Supported by a five-year $50-million grant from the U.S. Army, the
MIT-affiliated Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies is developing new
combat uniforms with embedded particle-size materials and devices
("nanotechnology") that could detect biological or chemical threats, detect
bleeding, and apply pressure. Using nanotechnology, shoes could be designed
to give soldiers enough extra energy to allow them to jump over 20-foot
walls, and their combat fatigues could contain light-deflecting material
that would make combatants blend in with their environments to become
almost invisible. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 13 Mar 2002)

[Invisibility Suits Are On Their Way. . . .]

[Not To Mention Invisible Newsrooms On The Evening News]

VIRTUAL NEWS SETS
More than 40 U.S. television stations and many production studios are now
using virtual newsrooms that give the impression that newscasters are
broadcasting from gigantic, futuristic sets when the truth is that they are
actually in cramped, narrow rooms. How is it done? Just about everything in
the room is painted a certain shade of blue, and when the TV camera records
that particular color it substitutes digital imagery to make people and any
objects not in that color appear superimposed on the digital set. So when
you see a news anchor standing in front of a huge wall of video monitors,
you're just seeing "smoke and mirrors" (or maybe just mirrors -- unless the
anchor's excitement set his pants on fire). (New York Times 14 Mar 2002)

CARLY CLAIMS VICTORY, HEWLETT SAYS IT AIN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER
Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina says she's been assured by HP's proxy
solicitor that the votes are running in favor of the proposed merger with
Compaq, but it will still take several weeks to determine the official
result of what appears to be the closest corporate election in years.
Meanwhile, HP director Walter Hewlett is refusing to concede victory,
saying the vote is still too close to call. Hewlett maintains that HP is
paying too much for Compaq and that the deal will mire HP in the low-margin
PC business. In anticipation of merger approval, Fiorina and Compaq CEO
Michael Capellas are drawing up plans to integrate the two companies and
say that together they can dramatically improve their end-to-end packages
for corporate customers, improve their PC divisions, and generate $2.5
billion a year in cost savings. (AP 20 Mar 2002)

COMPUTER COMPANIES SEEK SOLUTION ON PC RECYCLING COSTS
Consumer electronics manufacturers have taken a step closer toward
developing a plan to incorporate the costs of recycling obsolete equipment
into the pricetags of new PCs, peripherals and TVs. The National
Electronics Product Stewardship Initiative (NEPSI) is backed by a group of
high-tech companies, government agencies, and others, and is calling for a
"front-end financed system" to support the collection, reuse and recycling
of electronic devices. NEPSI is still deliberating an appropriate cost
structure for the program, and notes that current product recycling
programs run by individual companies such as HP, Sony and Best Buy charge
about $30 or less to dispose of older machines. (CNet News.com 19 Mar 2002)

FCC DECLARES CABLE INTERNET AN INFORMATION SERVICE
A decision Thursday by the Federal Communications Commission
classifies high-speed Internet access as an "information" rather
than a "telecommunications" service. The ruling, which came in a
3-1 vote, means that cable companies offering high-speed access
can sell their services without first opening their networks to
competitors. Opponents of the ruling, including rival ISPs and
telephone companies that offer DSL service, say the deregulatory
approach will limit competition in the market rather than
increasing it, and will reduce customer choice and access to
competitive services. Public comments are being accepted on the
ruling for 60 to 90 days.

LAWMAKERS CRITICIZE NET GOVERNANCE RESTRUCTURING PLAN
Some influential members of Congress are criticizing ICANN's
decision to abandon the establishment of permanent elected board
members and to create a committee that will explore how to
restructure ICANN. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman
W. J. Tauzin (R-La.) and ranking Democrat John Dingell (D-Mich.)
have told U.S. Commerce Secretary Donald Evans in a letter that
"the [Commerce] Department should not allow ICANN management to
retreat on any future prospects for open, democratic, private
sector-led management of certain limited technical Internet
functions." Several U.S. representatives have also signed the
letter. ICANN President Stuart Lynn defended the board decision
in a conference call with reporters, saying that radical new
proposals always draw fearful responses and that "ICANN is not
a global democracy."

THE WHOLE CRITTER CATALOG
The creators of the All Species Inventory project have set a
25-year deadline to catalog all living species on the planet
using the latest technology, thus closing a serious gap in human
knowledge, according to project co-founder Stewart Brand. The
project has an ambitious goal: to provide a Web page for every
species. Project directors envision tools such as pattern
recognition software, the Internet, global positioning systems,
and DNA analysis speeding up the identification and classification
of species. There are currently only about 10,000 taxonomists
active around the world, so directors are hoping that All Species
will swell their ranks with amateur naturalists by making
classification technology available to them. Others say the
technological aspects of All Species could help retool the
field's old-fashioned image, which has led to a cooling of
public and private support.

SUPPORT FOR ID CARDS WANING
National support for ubiquitous ID cards is beginning to taper
off after initial demand following the Sept. 11 attacks. In a
recent survey, Gartner found that just 26 percent of Americans
now support the idea and 41 percent oppose it. The week after
Sept. 11, the Pew Research Center found 70 percent backed a
national ID to help identify terrorists, a sentiment bolstered
by the fact that 11 of the hijackers used false IDs. The Gartner
poll found subtle differences in the way people perceived national
IDs, depending on what they would be used for. For airport
security, the IDs are largely supported, but not for use in
conjunction with health care or financial services. Most
respondents said that private industry should administer the
system if it is implemented. Critics of a national ID scheme
say the knee-jerk reaction to the terrorist attacks is giving
way to a more reasonable, calculated mentality that recognizes
the inherent flaws in any system. Privacy advocates had said
a national ID was one step closer to a police state where
government would be able to monitor citizens' movements and
activities.  (Wired News, 13 March 2002)

MORE WEB SITES CHARGING ACCESS FEES
The number of Web sites charging visitors for access to their
content is increasing, particularly as Web advertising sales
remain sluggish and venture capitalists are still reluctant to
invest. Although some online content is still free, it is being
used as an enticement to customers so that they will pay for access
to more extensive features. American Greetings has garnered almost
1 million subscribers since it implemented access fees for its
popular card sites. However, AmericanGreetings.com President
Michael Fink said the sites' traffic has decreased about 30
percent as customers defect to Yahoo! and Hallmark.com for free
cards. Still, Yahoo! is also moving to subscription services and
expects 50 percent of its revenue to come from subscribers in 2004.
