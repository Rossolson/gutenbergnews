*Headline News from Edupage

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

SUFFOLK CONSIDERS COUNTY-WIDE WI-FI
Suffolk County, in New York, is considering installing a free wireless
network that would fully cover the county's 900 square miles, offering
Internet access to 1.5 million residents. If built, the network would
be one of the largest in the nation, though officials in Chicago are
considering an even larger network, 940 square miles, that would cover
5 million people. Suffolk County includes considerable waterfront, and
county officials are considering having the network extend over the
water as well. Steve Levy, Suffolk County Executive, proposed the idea,
saying that a private firm would be contracted to develop and maintain
the network. Funding would come from advertising or from fees charged
for higher connection speeds. Because the project would be sponsored by
the county government, the proposed network has further fueled the
debate over whether governments should be involved in such projects at
all or if they should be taken up by commercial vendors.

COMMITTEE KILLS NET NEUTRALITY BILL
The House Energy and Commerce Committee has killed an amendment
designed to guarantee net neutrality. The amendment would have
prevented Internet service providers from delivering different content
at different speeds based on content providers' having paid extra
fees. Supporters of the amendment, including Microsoft, Amazon, and
Google, argued that the Internet was built on ideas antithetical to the
notion of paying fees to have content available to consumers. They
called on Congress not to drop the issue but to "enact legislation
preventing discrimination" against certain content providers. Opponents
of the amendment, including cable and phone companies, suggested that
the landscape of online content, including such material as
movie-quality video, could be available to consumers if content
providers paid a surcharge for it. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the
committee, commented that net neutrality is "still not clearly defined"
and that he doubts the dire predictions of the amendment's supporters.

DIGITAL DIVIDE SHRINKING
According to a study conducted by IBM and "The Economist" magazine,
although the digital divide remains considerable for some countries,
the gaps are shrinking. The study assessed both availability and use of
technology in 68 countries and assigned each an "e-readiness" score on
a scale of 1 to 10. The gap from the top of the list (Denmark, 9.00) to
the bottom (Azerbaijan, 2.92) is indeed significant, but in certain
regions of China and India, connectivity rivals that of developed
nations, according to Peter Korsten, European director at IBM's
Institute for Business Value. The study noted that nearly every
country's score improved from last year but that countries nearer the
bottom of the list saw greater gains than those in the upper tiers,
indicating a shrinking digital divide overall. Beyond the issue of
connectivity lies the question of what efforts each country makes to
use technology. As Korsten said, "It's up to governments to take
advantage with education and other initiatives."

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

[As requested adding sources, etc., when possible.
Remember, the subject is not the article's subject,
the subject is the manipulation of the world news.]


EXXON Is Buying Up Their Own Stock With Huge Profits

15% of profits to shareholders
Under 15% spent on search and research on new oil
40% of profits spents on buying back their own stock

ABC, NBC  April 27, 2006

Hendrick Hertzberg reported the "South Americanization"
program that somehow slipped by the US Supreme Court,
but I couldn't find and details on the PBS story, sorry,
not one hit.

RFID Tags Being Considered For Human Beings

You've all heard of the RFID [Radio Frequency ID] tags
used to track all sorts of wild animals, but now these
are being used more and more in urban environments and
are even now being advertized on commercial media from
the point of view of the pet owner who wants to find a
missing pet.  No mention is made of the high prices to
get your pet back when the pound or Humane Society has
them in their possession.

However, the REAL NEWS that no one is talking about is
that these RFID tags are being considered as mandatory
for people.  Obviously this is starting of low key, in
other countries, where societal pressures are greater,
but the truth is that these RFID tags, along with GPS,
Global Positioning Satellite gear in cell phones, were
being discussed by Western governments as well.

Expect a school near you to start requiring children's
parents to make sure they have a working RFID tag, and
that they will be sent back home if without one.  This
will start out with wrist bands that can be taken off,
then to something that can't be taken off, and finally
we will be treated like pets, and the RFID tags are to
be inserted under the skin, eventually at birth.

Big Brother will know where you are all the time.

You won't be able to turn the lights off in your cars,
but Big Brother won't have wear RFIDs and THEY will be
able to turn THEIR car lights off.


*DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

Oil reserves are at an 8 year high, but the oil companies are
telling us that the prices are being driven up by low supply.

It would appear that Sony BMG is telling their iTunes patrons
that they have a "license" for their music, which would allow
for about $.30 of the $.99 paid to go to the artists, but the
artists are being told it is a "sale" which gives them $.045.

In case you have heard of Gerrymandering, but don't know what it is,
the latest round of Gerrymandering is reported to have been to put a
majority of 80/20 in Democrat's districts and 60/40 for Republicans.
The result is that with the same number of votes, more Republicans--
but these reports should include that the Democrats have tried to do
the same thing at times, just weren't as good at it.

*STRANGE QUOTES OF THE WEEK

"Disgruntled" seems to be the quote of the week about the CIA leaks,
not to mention "retirement," forced or unforced.

Too many sources to name, just Google "disgruntled"


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

There will be 1/2 million free eBooks on the Internet, July 4, 2006


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

1/4 to 1/3 of major city shooting cases involved witness intimidation.

CBS News "Conspiracy of Silence"  April 27, 2006

*

All sorts of reports are coming out that say unemployment is down,
but none that tell how many jobs from above the old median incomes
have been replaces by jobs where your primary function is to say:

"Would You Like Fries With That?"

Real wages are still falling, even with two jobs in replacement.

One reference made to this was that the $400 million severance pay
to Exxon's CEO Raymond cost every one of the US driving households
$400 extra dollars at the gas pump.

They say that CEO compensation is over 400 times the average wage,
but in this case, that would mean the average severance pay was an
estimated million dollars for Exxon workers.

Obviously Exxon does not fall any where near the averages.

was playing the part of newsman, while Brokaw and Jennings WERE.]

133,000 U.S. women graduate from college for every 100,000 men.

*

Only 7% of U.S. prison inmates are women.

*

By the way, for those interested, the official U.S. population
estimates just passed 298 million, though many say estimations
of this nature leave out as much as 5% of the population, with
the obvious exclusion of the 11-12 million immigrant workers
now being mentioned so much in the news.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
is obviously no longer 6% of the world.  In fact, rounding to the
nearest percent, the US will soon fall from 5% to 4%.]

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.

POEM OF THE WEEK


Strolling Down the Avenue

On my right there are these tall white buildings
that place me back under the gate of time
where the old ladies and the old men of my dreams
are still incurable lovers
holding hands.  In the lady's eyes there are always these beautiful,
raw, surrendering to the earth colors
a charmed bouquet of lilac and lilies-of-the-valley

On my left there are the dim alleys of your thoughts
winding, meeting, melting into a green scent
that boldly ascends high above the tin roofs
towards the boomeranged moon

Behind me there are the shadows
creeping into the twilight of our mystified day
to which we patiently, but painfully paid a homage
of giving, taking, memories, and dust
like all the other old souls before us
with certitude, grief, horizon wide hopes, and elation

Ahead lies the Avenue
big, broad and bold, guarded by strongly built chestnut trees
the stature of the buildings that they veil, and just as steady.
White-pinkish flowers lay sprinkled by the wind for our bare feet,
as for all the other bare feet that walked this road before us
