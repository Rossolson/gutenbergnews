Subject: June Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
To: Michael Hart &lt;hart@pobox.com&gt;
Date: Wed, 4 Jun 1997 18:03:12 -0500 (CDT)


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for Tuesday June 4, 1997

With this issue we have reached Etext #933, though we were a little
behind all of the month of May, we managed to catch up just in time.

*

Try "transend.com.tw:/mirrors/gutenberg/etext"
We have a new Etext site up and running in Taiwan, and are working,
hopefully to be ready in a month or two, on a site in Australia.

*

We really NEED some serious volunteers who are willing to help with
Etexts in other languages. . .this is VERY difficult for dyslexics,
such as myself, who normally use only Plain Vanilla ASCII programs.

*

IP freak) it's in /home/ftp/mirrors/gutenberg

Larry Owens, who is handling DNS for the Sailor Network, has pointed out
to me that all DNS-related problems and requests should be addressed to:
   dns-admin@sailor.lib.md.us.
This includes DNS items for gutenberg.org .   If you do a 'whois' on
gutenberg.org, you'll see that this is the address for the technical



www.ul.cs.cmu.edu  These will also be available via FTP.


ftp://ftp.ihug.co.nz/pub/mirror/gutenberg
Adam Moore &lt;sickboy@ihug.co.nz&gt; and Sydney
