HERE'S THE NEWS FROM PG CANADA FOR AUGUST.


We published a total of 12 ebooks during the month: we have now published a
cumulative total of 164 ebooks.

The New Releases section at the top of the PGC main page always gives the
details of new releases for the most recent three months.

LANGUAGES:
- 7 titles were in English
- 5 were in French

GENRES
- 6 of the books were novels
- 3 were children's books
- 2 were collections of short stories and novellas
- 1 was non-fiction: a collection of essays

One of PG Canada's objectives is to have a strong collection of ebooks in
French.  We were delighted that this month almost half of the new titles we
offered are in French!

Only one of our books this month was by a Canadian, but it is a very special
ebook.  Pamphile Le May's "Contes Vrais" included not only Le May's celebrated
short stories, but includes illustrations by no fewer than twelve famous
Quebec artists of his period!  It is in effect a gallery of Quebec's artists
of the time.

We published two new titles in our series of novels by English novelist Sheila
Kaye-Smith (1887-1956), and three new titles in our series of novels by Henry
Gr√©ville (1842-1902).

Authors and illustrators new to PGC this month included:

Lee, Vernon [Paget, Violet] (1856-1935) [English novelist, essayist, and poet]
Mann, Thomas (1875-1955) [Romancier allemand] Weir, Harrison William (1824-
1906) [English author and illustrator]

Thanks as ever for your support!
