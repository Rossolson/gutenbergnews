Mark from PG Canada sent through his monthly newsletter covering the activities for August 2008.

With 12 new eBooks released in August (7 English, 5 French) the total number of PGCA titles now reaches 164!

GENRES

  * 6 of the books were novels
  * 3 were children's books
  * 2 were collections of short stories and novellas
  * 1 was non-fiction: a collection of essays

One of PG Canada's objectives is to have a strong collection of eBooks in French, with almost half the new titles this month in French they are certainly achieving this goal.

The New Releases section at the top of the [main PG Canada page,](http://www.gutenberg.ca/ "Visit the PG Canada website") gives up-to-date information on all the newest releases during the last three months.

In the newsletter Mark commented on a special release of Canadian author, Pamphile Le May's "Contes Vrais" including not only Le May's celebrated short stories, but with illustrations by no fewer than twelve famous Quebec artists of his period! It is in effect a gallery of Quebec's artists of the time.
