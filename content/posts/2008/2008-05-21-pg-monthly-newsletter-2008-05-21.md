<pre>/The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter, May 21, 2008/
e-Books Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971

55 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring!

This leaves 4 7/12 years, 18 1/3 seasons, or 55 months.

Not to worry.  I will still make predictions further on.



Chinese Moves Up!

Please note the number of our original Project Gutenberg
eBooks in Chinese has moved over 300 books, and thus has
now taken over the 5th place of books in languages other
than English.  List of Top 10 or so is below.


Spanish and Russian

We need to make a concerted effort to bring more eBooks,
of all kinds, to our readers of Spanish and Russian.

HEADLINE NEWS


As of today:  May 21, 2008:  "Original Project Gutenberg
eBook" site totals have reached 28,000, details below.

Please do not forget the 1600+ from PG of Australia, the
~500 from PG Europe, and the ~100 from PG Canada, with a
detailed list included below.  Not to mention the sites:
http://www.gutenberg.cc with 75,000+ eBooks, and Project
Runeberg with eBooks in the Scandinavian languages.


Please note:  the figures presented here are usually the
more conservative figures people have presented, but the
date of our eBook #25,000 was said to have been slightly
earlier than reported.  Personally, I would prefer to be
a little cautious about reporting the numbers of eBooks,
but if anyone would like to help us with the accounting,
that would be GRRRREAT!!!



As we have seen, our current batch of volunteers for the
Project Gutenberg Newsletters is now down to about zero,
so Greg Newby, PG CEO and I are working up a revival; so
if you would like to contribute or take over, email us.

I will continue to create The Monthly Newsletter, and to
get it out around the 21st of each month, counting down,
month by month, to the end of the Mayan calendar date of
December 21, 2012.


Note:  There won't be any new postings from PG Australia
for the rest of April, May, and possibly June.

Requesting A Third Time!

If there are any experts out there in Perl or Excel, you
would be greatly appreciated in helping us with numbers;
daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.  We can provide data,
and hopefully you can provide us with weekly, monthly or
yearly totals for these Newsletters.

If you would like a complete listing of each book title,
and the accompanying data, we do have a daily listing to
subscribe to, which also includes additional data on the
book as it is uploaded for final preparation.


Requesting A Second Time


I need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.


In addition, I will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and
totals from PG of Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at:
