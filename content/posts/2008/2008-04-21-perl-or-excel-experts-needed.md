If there are any experts out there in Perl or Excel, you would be greatly appreciated in helping us with PG statistical numbers; daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. We can provide data, and hopefully you can provide us with weekly, monthly or yearly totals for the Newsletters.

If you would like a complete listing of each book title, and the accompanying data, we do have a daily listing to subscribe to, which also includes additional data on the book as it is uploaded for final preparation.
