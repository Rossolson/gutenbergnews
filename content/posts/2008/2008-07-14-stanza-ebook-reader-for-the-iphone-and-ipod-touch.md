<span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE:</span> Stanza is no longer maintained so I’d recommend you try out Bluefire Reader. Checkout my <a style="color: #e5554e;" href="https://www.epubbooks.com/ereaders/apple-iphone-ipod-touch" target="_blank">iPhone review</a> or <a style="color: #e5554e;" href="https://www.epubbooks.com/ereaders/apple-ipad">iPad review</a> over on epubBooks for some more information on reading EPUB books on the iPhone with Blurefire and other apps.

If you are looking for a free eBook reader for your [Apple iPhone or iPod Touch](/20081031/apple-iphone-touch-stanza-and-project-gutenberg/ "Apple iPod Touch/iPhone Review") then you might want to try the new Stanza reader from Lexcycle.

I don't have an iPhone or iPod Touch myself so have no first-hand experience, but Feedbooks co-found Hadrien Gardeur, has made a post over on mobileread.com that Stanza [link removed] has the ability to download ePub books directly from FeedBooks.com using their API. FeedBooks have many of the top classics found at gutenberg.org, from Jane Austin to Alexandre Dumas to Jules Verne.

For those of you who don't know, the IDPF ePub format is an open standard eBook format that is fast being <a href="http://blog.epubbooks.com/10/penguin-uk-release-their-books-in-epub-format" target="_blank">adopted by many big name publishers</a> including Penguin UK and O'Reilly as well as projects such as Feedbooks.com.

Over the coming months we are likely to see a number of iPhone apps that will allow you to read those free, public domain eBooks from Project Gutenberg, and Stanza will certainly continue to be one of the top ones. So, if you want to read Project Gutenberg books on your iPhone, then just stop by the app store and download Stanza now.
