RIP ROBERT MARQUARDT, PG-SF BOOKSHELF CREATOR

Robert Marquardt, PG's wiki sysop, died this morning [2007/12/29]. His work
must remain unfinished and questions to him will remain unanswered. This was
his last will. This info was added by his brother Rolf Marquardt today
at PG's wiki.

Robert joined Project Gutenberg in December 2006 to create the Science Fiction
Bookshelf. He has completed the Project Gutenberg Science Fiction CD, which
was a tremendously huge success. He also made a promotional video for PG in
Esperanto. He was now working in other bookshelves.

Robert always worked very hard at PG, even while he was doing his hard cancer
treatments.

I'm sure that these are sad news to all volunteers. PGLAF should perhaps take
some symbolic condolences action.

END OF 2007 PG STATISTICS

Another year is over for Project Gutenberg and as always it has been a busy
one. Although we started out a little slow we had a great charge in the last
few months, yet again our volunteers posted over four thousands new titles.
We hit some impressive milestones along the way and also welcomed some new
projects; PG Canada and DP Canada.

The combined PG projects have now produced a total of 26,161 titles, a
fantastics effort by all involved and I don't see any reason why we won't
reach the 30,000 mark before the end of 2008!

The usual newsletter statistics are presented as normal but I would like to
outline a few interesting numbers here [I've also created a nice graph which
can be found on the gutenbergnews.org website].


The most number of books posted...
 ...in one day was 65 on the 26th December
 ...in one week was 151 in Week 18 (week ending 9th May)
 ...in one month was 477 in November

We averaged 338 books per month, 78 per week and 11.13 per day.

99 titles have been REposted to the new filing system, bringing us almost
to the 2,000 mark...not too bad but I am sure we can do much better for 2008!


Here is a small selection of project milestones;

TOTAL Project Gutenberg e-Texts
 * 26,000 on 2007/12/24
 * 25,000 on 2007/10/12
 * 24,000 on 2007/07/10
 * 23,000 on 2007/04/15

PG-US
 * 24,000 on 2007/12/27
 * 22,500 on 2007/09/09

PG-AU
 * 1,500 on 2007/04/07


Thanks to all our volunteers and good luck in 2008.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
