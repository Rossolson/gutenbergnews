FEATURED NEWS

NEWSLETTER EDITORS REQUIRED

I'm sure many of you read the post from Michael Hart that I am having to step
down from the editor position. Since moving to Germany my new job and life has
made it difficult to keep on top of the editors responsibilities. Although it's
not an especially time consuming position it does require a certain
reliability, which I am finding difficult to provide.

Since Michael's request we've had several people showing an interest. Perhaps
it is time to create a 'team' of editors - with the number of interested
parties we have, now could be a great time to try this new approach.

Therefore we are looking for any interested persons to bring forward their
ideas for contributes to the weekly newsletter. We know this new direction
will produce a really fantastic newsletter!

(The 'team' idea is not fixed and we could still stay with the one editor
formula.)

You can contact us by emailing editor@gutenbergnews.org OR hart@pglaf.org

The PG-News site will stay live and I will continue to update it with news
and stats from the newsletters, along with adding to the newsletter archives.

All the best

Michael Cook

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
