<pre>/The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter, Aug. 21, 2008/
e-Books Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971

52 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring!

This leaves 4 1/4 years, 17 1/3 seasons, or 52 months.

Not to worry.  I will still make predictions further on.





Requesting A Second Time


I need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.


In addition, I will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and totals from PG of
Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at:
