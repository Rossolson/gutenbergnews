<pre>The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter, April 21, 2008

e-Books Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971

56 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring!

This leaves 4 2/3 years, 18 2/3 seasons, or 56 months...

Not to worry.  I will still make predictions further on.



HEADLINE NEWS

As of today, April 21, 2008, original "Project Gutenberg
eBook" site totals have reached 25,000, having passed on
from 24,998 in the period since yesterday's totals for a
new total of 25,004.


eBook #25,000 is:

Thanks to Suzanne Lybarger, Jane Hyland, Brian Janes and
the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at

Please do not forget the 1600+ from PG of Australia, the
~500 from PG Europe, and the ~100 from PG Canada, with a
detailed list included below.


Exact figures follow the rest of the Newsletter.



As we have seen, our current batch of volunteers for the
Project Gutenberg Newsletters is now down to about zero,
so Greg Newby, PG CEO, and I are working up a revival so
if you would like to contribute or take over, email us.

I will continue to create The Monthly Newsletter, and to
get it out around the 21st of each month, counting down,
month by month, to the end of the Mayan calendar date of
December 21, 2012.


Note:  There won't be any new postings from PG Australia
for the rest of April, May, and possibly June.

Second Request!

If there are any experts out there in Perl or Excel, you
would be greatly appreciated in helping us with numbers;
daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.  We can provide data,
and hopefully you can provide us with weekly, monthly or
yearly totals for these Newsletters.

If you would like a complete listing of each book title,
and the accompanying data, we do have a daily listing to
subscribe to, which also includes additional data on the
book as it is uploaded for final preparation.


First Request

I need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.


In addition, I will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and
totals from PG of Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at:
