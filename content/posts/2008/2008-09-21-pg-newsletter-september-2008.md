Project Gutenberg founder, Michael Hart, has now sent out the latest PG newsletter. We are just about to reach a new milestone;

> We are rapidly approaching 30,000 eBooks in the originating Project Gutenberg collections...we should pass 30,000 before the end of the year.

It's interesting to note that eBooks in the Chinese language are coming in fast, placing Chinese in the top 5 language list. There are still 307 titles on the PrePrints site, which need to be catalogued so anyone who can work in Chinese is encouraged to look in the [PrePrints directory labelled _china_](http://preprints.readingroo.ms/china/ "Chinese folder at PrePrints") â€“ a .zip file containing all the files is available. Once all 307 titles are online the total will be 627, then placing Chinese second in our non-English languages collection.

**Project Gutenberg Conferences**

Early spring 2009 will see Michael Hart give a presentation in Buenos Aires for a new internet effort called "Both Americas." The goal for this is to bring Spanish to the "Top 5" of the language list; Spanish is currently placed 8th in the PG archives and does not represent the volume at which it is spoken throughout the world.

The full newsletter can be found in the [2008 Newsletter Archives](/20090107/pg-newsletter-archives-2008/ "PG 2008 Newsletter Archives").
