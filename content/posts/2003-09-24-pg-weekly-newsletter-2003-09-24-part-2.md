Editorial

Hello,

A short little number this week. I think we must have used up all the
special material in the past few weeks. However, I know that there are
some superb books in the pipeline, and I also know that we are now
looking at the possibility of hitting that 10,000 mark by October
15th. I saw a message on a volunteer board earlier that said 'surely,
it can't be that easy'. Gentle reader, I leave it to you to decide.

Happy reading,

Alice

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

2) News and Comment

Other news items this week


Music - Help with Finale and Sibelius

Joel Erickson* is trying to convert the current music files in PG from
Finale format, into Sibelius format. There's only one problem. He
could really use help from someone who has a copy of Finale 2002
(apparently, 2003 just doesn't cut the mustard) to do this. If you
think you can help Joel in any way, please mail him at Joel at
oneporpoise.com, or mail us here at the newsletter and we will pass
your message along.


-----------------------------

Project Gutenberg is interested digitized music in all forms.  We
have a large-format scanner suitable for sheet music, and have
released musical scores in Finale and MusicXML formats.  We would
welcome MIDI, Lilypond, and other formats (Photoscore (.opt),
NIFF(.nif), SCORE page(.mus, .pag, .pge) and Sibelius 6/7 (.s7)), as
well. Visit:
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music
for our current sheet music offerings and files available for
processing.  Contemporary scores (with copyright permission) and
older musical plays would also be of interest.  As for all
Project Gutenberg items, the first step is to get copyright
clearance (http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html).

3) Notes and Queries, Reviews and Features

F Scott Fitzgerald

What happened to the Jazz-Age generation? A newspaper reporter once
asked Francis Scott Fitzgerald. He answered "Some became brokers and
threw themselves out of windows. Others became bankers and shot
themselves. Still others became newspaper reporters. And a few became
successful authors."
Nowadays he fits completely into the last category. Faulkner,
Hemingway and Fitzgerald are symbols of American Literature in the
20th Century. But in the year 1940, when he died in Hollywood from the
heart attack provoked by prolonged alcoholism, the obituaries were
mourning more about the unfulfilled promises than about the premature
death of the genius.

F. Scott Fitzgerald went to Hollywood in 1937, when his life was
 already reaching its nadir. His wife Zelda was permanently in
 psychiatric hospitals, his financial situation was not far from
 catastrophe, he was a heavy and unhappy drinker, already buried by
 critics as another gone-off talent and literature has-been. His
 self-characteristic in his 1935 'Crack-Up' essays was a -cracked
 plate. And the typical passage from this depression stimulated work
 is "Now the standard cure for one who is sunk is to consider those in
 actual destitution or physical suffering. This is an all-weather
 beatitude for gloom in general, but at 3 o'clock in the morning the
 cure doesn't work-- and in a real dark night of the soul it is always
 3 o'clock in the morning."

 'Tender is the Night' published a year before the essays (and entered
 to PG Australia this week) despite its calmer and more uncertain
 ending, has the same air of decline, since the troubles and
 unsettledness were marked his life a for long time. You can find
 those black marks during 7 long years in Europe, which ended with his
 wife Zelda's breakdown in 1930. Customary debts and broken friendship
 were another American literature pillar of 20th century living at
 that time in Old World. The Fitzgeralds sailed to Europe in 1924 in
 search for new excitements and a hopefully less expensive life. They
 deliberately took the unlicensed ship and on its sober boards the 30
 years old Francis, yet full of energy and willpower, finished the
 'The Great Gatsby'. But again it already was not a very happy time -
 the debts were deep, and the failure of the play 'Vegetable' in 1923
 followed the reasonable success of 'Tales of the Jazz Age' in 1922.

And even in 1920, immediately after the tremendous success of his
first big work 'This Side of Paradise', Fitzgerald was traveling along
Broadway in an open-top car. It was a warm, still night, and he was in
a heightened state of drunken exhilaration. The future seemed
infinitely inviting. Then, bafflingly, he began to cry - because "life
would never be so sweet again".  Was it the self-fulfilled prophecy or
just normal reaction of sensitive nervous system to the alcoholic
intoxication, I can not say. It was hard to foretell the twillight in
1920 - he was 23 years old, praised by all critics and public as the
most promising contemporary American author and living the life as far
away from the grey surviving routine as possible. Same year he has
married Miss Zelda Sayre, daughter of Anthony D. Sayre, an Alabama
Supreme Court Justice, the girl who previously had broken their
engagement, due to fear of underfinanced life with young and poor
Francis. But strangely his words did came out true - the most
enjoyable years of his life were already over. Those were years spent
in the army (1917-1919) and before that in Princeton (1912-1917),
where he concentrated on the playwriting and having good time in
general. The constant shortness in finances was always in the air, but
the energy and talent were abundant, so the sorrows were sweet, the
nights tender and the conversations full of hidden sense and open fire
- Back there, on Christmas parties in 1914, 18-years old Francis met
and fall in love with lovely Ginevra King - future prototype for all
those witty, joyful young ladies dancing and flirting with southern
accent in his stories. He was 'handsome, insouciant and possessing
unusual gifts for story telling'.

Here I want to stop and let him stay at this moment of his life, as he
always wanted, instead of describing the childhood of a son of serial
bankrupt growing up in the wealthy neighborhood of St. Paul. Let's
leave it to the real biographers and just go and greet today the
Mollie McQuillan-Fitzgerald and Edward Fitzgerald with the birth of
their son Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, named so after the famous
ancestor from Mollie's side - Francis Scott Key, composer of "The Star
Spangled Banner. The newborn is screaming and others are smiling. And
actually they are right - the great talent was born today - on 24th of
September 1896 in the privet home at 481 Laurel Avenue, St. Paul.

Internet:
http://www.sc.edu/fitzgerald/ - has many interesting documents,
including obituaries, voice and film clips etc. Amongst them the test
of 'Romantic Egotist' - the novel that Fitzgerald wrote during the
service in the army and which was then transformed to 'This Side of
Paradise'. It has also lovely small collection of his short stories
(follow the writings link for this
http://www.sc.edu/fitzgerald/writings.html ), that will bring the
splash of the hot lazy wind of South on your face chilled under the
air-conditioner.

The sunlight dripped over the house like golden paint over an art
jar, and the freckling shadows here and there only intensified the
rigor of the bath of light. The Butterworth and Larkin houses flanking
were intrenched behind great stodgy trees; only the Happer house took
the full sun, and all day long faced the dusty road-street with a
tolerant kindly patience. This was the city of Tarleton in
southernmost Georgia, September afternoon.

Up in her bedroom window Sally Carrol Happer rested her
nineteen-year-old chin on a fifty-two-year-old sill and watched Clark
Darrow's ancient Ford turn the corner. The car was hot-- being partly
metallic it retained all the heat it absorbed or evolved -- and Clark
Darrow sitting bolt upright at the wheel wore a pained, strained
expression as though he considered himself a spare part, and rather
likely to break. He laboriously crossed two dust ruts, the wheels
squeaking indignantly at the encounter, and then with a terrifying
expression he gave the steering-gear a final wrench and deposited self
and car approximately in front of the Happer steps. There was a
plaintive heaving sound, a death-rattle, followed by a short silence;
and then the air was rent by a startling whistle.

Sally Carrol gazed down sleepily. She started to yawn, but finding
this quite impossible unless she raised her chin from the window-sill,
changed her mind and continued silently to regard the car, whose owner
sat brilliantly if perfunctorily at attention as he waited for an
answer to his signal. After a moment the whistle once more split the
dusty air.

"Good mawnin'."

With difficulty Clark twisted his tall body round and bent a distorted
glance on the window.

"'Tain't mawnin', Sally Carrol."

"Isn't it, sure enough?"

"What you do in'?"

"Eatin' 'n apple."

"Come on go swimmin'-- want to?"

"Reckon so."

"How 'bout hurryin' up?"

"Sure enough."

Sally Carrol sighed voluminously and raised herself with profound
inertia from the floor, where she had been occupied in alternately
destroying parts of a green apple and painting paper tops for her
younger sister. She approached a mirror, regarded her expression with
a pleassd and pleasant languor, dabbed two spots of rouge on her lips
and a grain of powder on her nose, and covered her bobbed corn-colored
hair with a rose littered sun bonnet. Then she kicked over the
painting water, said, "Oh, damn!" -- but let it lay-- and left the room.
