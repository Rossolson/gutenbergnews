Today marks the fourth anniversary of the launch of Project Gutenberg Canada on July 1st 2007.

We launched PG Canada to give Canadians full access to online versions of works in our public domain that are under copyright in other countries, notably the United States and the European Union. These countries have foolishly extended their copyright durations; Canada has defended its citizens' ownership of the public domain by leaving copyright durations largely untouched. The range of our titles reflects this.

But PG Canada has grown far beyond its modest beginnings. Our catalogue now includes more than 800 titles, from Canada and other countries, in French and English, but also in other languages. Many of our titles are from the twentieth century; but some of our Canadian historical titles date back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The first four years have far exceeded our most optimistic projections. And our future is bright.

_Please note that the [800th eBook](http://www.gutenberg.ca/ebooks/innis-historyofthecpr/innis-historyofthecpr-00-h.html) presented by Project Gutenberg of Canada is a GREAT history of building the transcontinental railroad!  Well worth a look, even if only to scan the high points.  A major accomplishment!_
