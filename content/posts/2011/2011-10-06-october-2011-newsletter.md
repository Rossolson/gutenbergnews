As many people are aware, Project Gutenberg's founder passed away on September 6.  Information about the life and legacy of Michael Hart is online here: [www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael\_S.\_Hart](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart)

Thanks to the many fans, friends, and eBook enthusiasts who shared in our sadness of this sudden loss.  Michael will be remembered fondly, and there is no doubt that his leadership in digitization and free distribution of literature has had a lasting impact.  Part of that legacy is the ongoing activity of Project Gutenberg, which continues unabated.

I do intend to maintain this monthly newsletter, and as always the newsletter welcomes contributions of all types.

## New Mirroring Service

Project Gutenberg now offers mirroring capability for our generated content.  This consists of epub and other file formats which are not created "by hand," but automatically produced.  These formats are well-suited for eBook reader devices, and quite popular.  This new offering is for people who want to do massive downloads of these files, including creating your own copy of the Project Gutenberg collection: [Mirroring How-To](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Mirroring_How-To)

## Get Involved

Want to help create new eBooks?  The easiest way to get started as a Project Gutenberg volunteer is with Distributed Proofreaders.  Visit: [www.pgdp.net](http://www.pgdp.net).
