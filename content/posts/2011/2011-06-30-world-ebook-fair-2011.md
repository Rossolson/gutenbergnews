Come join the celebration, "It's the Year of the eBook!"

We should be adding thousands of books, new and old, to the following libraries every single day for an entire month of July 4 to August 4, 2011 at our 6th annual [World eBook Fair](http://www.worldebookfair.org).

All are welcome!

We will have three eLibraries each with over a million books:

  * [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org) is approaching three million books.
  * [World Public Library](http://www.worldpubliclibrary.org) already has two million.
  * [WattPad](http://www.wattpad.com) has 1.6 million new modern eBooks.

In addition to the 6.4 million items above, we will have some very impressive collections from:

  * [Gutenberg Consortia Center](http://www.gutenberg.cc) with 75,000 classic .pdf eBooks.
  * [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) with 40,000 multi-format classic and 1,000 new eBooks.
  * 80,000 music scores, etc. at the [IMSLP/Petrucci Music Library](http://imslp.org).

We are also working on an additional large library collection and could easily pass 7.5 million items during this event.<!--more-->

Disclaimer:Â  _As with all large book collections, many titles appear in more than one edition thus the same edition may be in multiple collections. In this case there is even more duplication than usual since several of these eLibraries work for the same ends and from the same materials. Thus you should expect that out of a 6.5 million grand total we have several million duplicates. While no one is suggesting that half were dupes, the highest estimates do approach half. The fact is that materials are coming in so fast that we are having trouble keeping up so you may note slight discrepancies in the totals above._
