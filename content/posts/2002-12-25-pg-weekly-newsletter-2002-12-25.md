Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!


Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


We will also have this
new address in Chicago!


Charles Aldarondo
701 Riverside Drive
Park Ridge, IL 60068


Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

From: Miranda van de Heijning &lt;m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com&gt;
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

Planetary scanning help needed in Yorkshire, England for fragile 19th
century books of A'bp Whately     Please contact:  david@whateley.org
We need a non-destructive method of scanning this delicate material.]

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the first 51 weeks of this year, we have produced 2,336 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our *FIRST* 2,336 eBooks!!!

            That's 51 WEEKS as Compared to 29 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,583 eBooks online as of December 18, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.52 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.36 when we had 4232 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.77 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 6583 eBooks in 31 1/2 Years We Averaged
    209 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     17 Per Month
     .6 Per Day

At 2283 eBooks Done In 2002 We Averaged
      6 eBooks Per Day
     46 eBooks Per Week
    198 eBooks Per Month !!!

[WARNING!!!]
POP-UP ADS 'KICK THROUGH'
Pop-up ads are becoming increasingly annoying, and the latest twist will
make it harder for Web users to simply ignore them. A new technique called
"kick through" enables advertisers to direct a person to another Web site
if they simply move their cursor across the ad -- no clicking is necessary.
Many people are complaining that the new ads are overstepping the
boundaries of an already intrusive form of online advertising. "When I
tried to close the window it kicked me to the site, which is really
annoying when I have six windows open and three of which were not by my own
doing," says one irate victim. Orbitz, which appears to be the only
advertiser currently using the kick through, defends its strategy: "The
enormous success for Orbitz is directly related to these pop-unders.
There's an enormous segment of the population that are appreciating these
ads," says Mark Rattin, creative director for Otherwise, which devised the
ads for Orbitz. He says there's only a 30% chance that viewers will be
kicked through to the Orbitz site by rolling over the ads. (CNet News.com

RUSSIAN FIRM CLEARED IN U.S. COPYRIGHT CASE
ElcomSoft Co. Ltd., based in Moscow, has been found not guilty of criminal
charges that it violated the 1998 U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act by
selling a software program designed to circumvent the digital locks used to
enforce copyright protections on Adobe Systems e-book software. The
two-week trial was the first criminal prosecution under the controversial
DCMA, which prohibits the sale of technology that can be used to break the
code that "locks" digitally formatted movies, music and other software. The
case hinged on whether ElcomSoft had "willfully" violated U.S. law, an
intent the defendants denied. "They never intended to violate the law,"
said defense attorney Joseph Burton. ElcomSoft president Alexander Katalov
pointed out that the program was legal in Russia and was not meant to be
used for electronic books that had not been legally purchased. He said he
didn't know that the software was illegal under U.S. law.(Reuters 17 Dec 2002)

AOL PATENTS INSTANT MESSAGING TECHNOLOGY
AOL Time Warner has quietly won a U.S. patent for its ICQ instant messaging
technology, representing a potential goldmine for the media giant. The
broadly worded patent defines AOL's IM application as one that enables users
to chat with and identify one another across a specific "communications
network," opening up the possibility for AOL to collect royalties from
rivals. ICQ, which was developed in the mid-1990s by a group of Israeli
scientists at a company called Mirabilis, was the first breakthrough chat
application. It filed a patent for its technology in 1997 and was acquired
by AOL in 1998 for $287 million. (Reuters 19 Dec 2002)

SUN'S CHRISTMAS COMES EARLY IN VICTORY OVER MICROSOFT
A U.S. district court judge ruled Monday that Microsoft had violated Sun
Microsystems' copyright for its Java software and ordered the software
giant to include Sun's version of Java with its Windows operating system,
handing Sun a double-barreled victory over its high-tech rival. The case
stems from Sun's claims that Microsoft dropped Sun's Java software in favor
of its own variation, which Sun alleges is incompatible with its
technology. "Unless Sun is given a fair opportunity to compete in a market
untainted by the effects of Microsoft's past antitrust violations, there is
a serious risk that in the near future the market will tip in favor of
Net, that it is impossible to ascertain when such tipping might occur in
time to prevent it from happening, and that if the market does tip in favor
of .Net, Sun could not be adequately compensated in damages," wrote Judge
J. Frederick Motz in his decision. Microsoft says it plans to appeal the
decision. (CNet News.com 23 Dec 2002)

GERMAN STATE PLANS TO BLOCK U.S.-BASED NEO-NAZI SITES
The German state of North Rhine-Westphalia plans to require the Internet
service providers located within its jurisdiction to block two U.S.-based
neo-Nazi Web sites. Government official Ulrich Shiefelbein says: "We don't
want such content to be available to everyone." Internet service providers
in the state are appealing the decision of a court that approved the plan,
and are threatening to leave North Rhine-Westphalia for other German states
that don't have such requirements. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 19 Dec 2002)

ACADEMICS PUSH FOR FREE, ONLINE ACCESS TO JOURNALS
Since the advent of the Internet, many academics have complained about
the practice of charging for online access to scientific journals, as
is done by many high-profile publications, including Science and
Nature. Now, a $9 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation will support a new organization that will publish two new
online journals, one on biology and the other on medicine, that will be
entirely free. The Public Library of Science will be led by Dr. Harold
E. Varmus, a Nobel laureate in medicine and president of the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Varmus, one of the critics of charging
for online access to scientific articles, said, "The written record is
the lifeblood of science." Dr. Donald Kennedy, the editor of Science,
defended the subscriptions, however, noting that the publication's
standards and costs are high. He said that the number of downloads of
articles relative to the subscription fee indicates that each article
is being accessed for just a few cents each.

ORGANIZATIONS ASK FOR COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS
Several organizations, including the American Library Association, the
Association of American Universities, and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, will file paperwork with the U.S. Copyright Office
requesting exceptions to the copy-protection provisions of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The groups argue that electronic
measures to prevent copying also limit protected fair use rights to
make copies for backup and educational purposes. Most observers, and
many representatives of groups that otherwise might file similar
requests, admit that the odds of being granted an exception by the
Copyright Office are extremely remote. Nevertheless, these and several
other organizations are expected to file the requests, which are due today.

ELCOMSOFT ACQUITTED OF COPYRIGHT VIOLATION
The Russian software company ElcomSoft, Ltd. was acquitted by a
California federal court for copyright violations. The Justice
Department took ElcomSoft to court, in the first such case to go to
trial, for having developed a program that disables security features
of e-book software from Adobe Systems. ElcomSoft's application allowed
e-book users to make copies of those books and to read them on other
devices, actions which are generally protected as "fair use." The
Justice Department, citing the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA), said the application could also allow piracy of the e-books.
ElcomSoft argued that its application was not intended to support
piracy and that the application is not illegal in Russia. The jury
agreed with ElcomSoft, but experts nevertheless expect more such
prosecutions under the DMCA.
