MARKETINTELL NOW: EBOOKS POLL

Project Gutenberg recently received an email from MarketIntellNow,
(http://www.marketintellnow.com) a Maryland-based, six-year old market
research firm that focuses on nascent niches. They do a lot of polling using
a methodology called "ANWO", they then blog about the results at a high
level (for free) while selling the resulting report in their eStore.

Of late they have started examining the world of eBooks and just recently
polled 5,000 Netizens on the subject.

I emailed them back to see if they could pass along some insights on what the
poll told, here is their response;

eBooks has to date been all ranch, no cattle. That's about to change;
here's why:

Amazon and others are about to deliver a dizzying array of e-titles of all
types. Sure, there's still the format issue (Sony Reader unwisely landlocks
users with their BBeB format) but this will wash out fast, because the revenue
opportunity is vast. Never underestimate America's slavish love of speed and
convenience; our survey of 5,000 Netizens shows that a big reason eBooks is
at the inflection point is because readers want what they want
instantaneously.

...and talking of Polls...

Some time back I started a poll to see how many e-texts from the PG archives
our visitors have read. As there was almost no response for this I decided to
leave the poll running.

Now though, I think it is time to wrap this one up. So, if you have not
already voted then visit www.gutenbergnews.org and place your vote now!

Here are the current results;

How many e-texts have you read from the PG archives?
 * 26% -- 200+
 * 21% -- 1-10
 * 18% -- 10-20
 * 13% -- 50-100
 * 11% -- 20-50
 * 11% -- 100-200

Total Voters: 38

This poll will close in two weeks and the results will be shown in the
21-November-2007 Newsletter.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
