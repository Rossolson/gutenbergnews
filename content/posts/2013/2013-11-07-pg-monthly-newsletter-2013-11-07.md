* Notable new book series: Warren Commission

Volumes 1-12 of the Warren Commission report have been released by
Project Gutenberg.  This helps to commemorate the 50th anniversary of
the death of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963.  Michael
Hart, Project Gutenberg's founder, told me the story of how he met
President Kennedy briefly when he was running for office.  This
happened on the quad at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign.  Michael told me he was impressed by JFK's strong
presence, keen intellect, and razor-sharp attention. (gbn)
