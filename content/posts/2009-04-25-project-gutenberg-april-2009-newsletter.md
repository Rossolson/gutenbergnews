Just recently Project Gutenberg had a major crashe of their hardrives and subsequently lost some data and the newsletter lists were destroyed. They are currently using some ancient backups but most people should still be on the list.

A number of poeple have been asking how to subscriber/unsubscribe from the Project Gutenberg mailing list. Full instructions can be found at [www.gutenberg.org/howto/subscribe-howto](http://www.gutenberg.org/howto/subscribe-howto "Project Gutenberg mailing list instructions") but here is a quick overview;
