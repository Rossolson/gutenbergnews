Project Gutenberg is thrilled to achieve the milestone of eBook #50,000. In honor of Project Gutenberg's founder, Michael S. Hart, a special title was selected. "_John Gutenberg, First Master Printer, His Acts, and most remarkable Discourses, and his Death_" is now available at [www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50000](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50000).

Johannes (or John) Gutenberg is best known for introducing mechanical movable type printing to Europe. This brought about a revolution in printing, which was a key event in shaping today's information and knowlege-based society.

Michael Hart invented the electronic book in 1971, launching what would become his life's major calling. He named his effort "_Project Gutenberg_," to recognize the impact of Johannes Gutenberg and in anticipation of electronic books helping to transform society by bringing cost-free literature to all people. Free literature, and the freedom of thought and freedom of expression it fosters, is key to growth of literacy, opportunity and enlightenment.<!--more-->

You can read more about Michael Hart at [www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael\_S.\_Hart](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart) or in [this Wikipedia article](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart).

To join in celebrating the great gift of free literature, please read a book. Or share a book. Or share a whole collection of books. Michael was proud of all efforts to give books.

On behalf of Michael Hart, and of Project Gutenberg, my huge thanks and appreciation to all the volunteers who have helped to achieve this milestone. I invite you to join Distributed Proofreaders at [www.pgdp.net](http://www.pgdp.net), to assist in digitizing a future Project Gutenberg eBook.
