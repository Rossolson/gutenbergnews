               DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS ANNOUNCES 10,000TH EBOOK
                                (Michael Hart)

CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!

In a serious move to release eBooks in a number of fields on this momentous
occasions, The Distributed Proofreaders have surpassed the great milestone of
10,000 eBooks, long thought to be dividing line between feasibility study and
the real thing.

Well, Distributed Proofreaders is definitely a real thing in terms of being one
of the most successful projects the Internet and World Wide Web have ever seen,
taking a five year term since getting up to speed and parlaying it into an
electronic library second to none in the world.

Without any more funding than a few nice scanners and the other necessities of
virtual life, some 50,000 volunteers have worked to bring these 10,000
electronic books to the world at large. . .all free for the downloading.

From rare languages to Linnaeus on species to children's, and other classics,
including Shakespeare in French, this group is involved in the extension of
libraries beyond an imagination of just a few years ago.

These works include fundamentals in many fields across an impressive set of
subjects from agriculture to an example of the finest from The Golden Age of
Science Fiction with the first installment of the famous "Lensman Series."

Also included are ethnology reporting to the Smithsonian, along with a folk
history of American slavery, and shanty songs sung by sailors on the open seas.

This small collection that puts Distributed Proofreaders, and their army of
volunteers, across the 10,000 book mark includes works in handful of languages,
both in originals and also in translation. . .a fitting example of the list of
the 10,000 eBooks already prepared, and those to come.

Again Congratulations!!!

                  DP PRESS RELEASE: DP RELEASES 10,000TH BOOK

Today Distributed Proofreaders &lt;http://www.pgdp.net&gt; (DP) posted a package of
texts that takes us over 10,000 completed titles. I'm very proud of our
community of volunteers who have accomplished this beautiful number. The 10K
package (listed below) showcases the wide range of our volunteers' interests and
talents.

There are examples of a number of our on-going large projects including the
Slave Narratives (now over half done), the Bureau of American Ethnography
reports, periodicals (this issue of Punch is the 280th that we've done), and the
beginning of a new project, Linnaeus' Species Plantarum. Children's literature
and Science Fiction are two popular areas and both are represented on this list.
Shakespeare in French and John Evelyn's classic work on the trees of England
represent the classics. The Shanty Book has music to listen to, and the
Encyclopedia of Needlework deserves its name, being so large and full of
illustrations.

It's hard to argue which of these titles is the most significant, but I lean
towards The annals of the Cakchiquels. Here is what one of the people involved
with its production told me about it, "The Annals of the Cakchiquels contains
the text and translation of a document written in the 17th century in Cakchiquel
Maya, a Mayan language of highland Guatemala. The document begins with a history
of the Cakchiquel people and continues with the history of the writer's family
through the arrival of the Spanish in the area and to the date of the writing.
It is one of the few documents written in Mesoamerican indigenous languages that
contain the history of the people before the Spanish Conquest. The author,
Daniel G. Brinton, was an early archaeologist, ethnologist, and linguist."

There are thousands of DP volunteers who have made this milestone possible. They
all deserve thanks for their contributions!

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Grand Total and not the overall PG-EU
total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
