The <a title="Amazon Kindle Reader" rel="external nofollow" href="/out.php?id=amazon&s=1&t=amazon-kindle&c=post236">Amazon Kindle</a> is not only the latest E-Ink book reader to hit the market it also one with the highest profiles. A couple of the biggest differences of the Kindle over other readers such as the [Sony Reader (PRS-505)](/20071003/sony-reader-digital-book-prs-505/ "Sony Reader (PRS-505)") and the Cybook Gen3, are that the Kindle has wireless connectivity and a mini-keyboard.

This wireless connectivity allows the user to access books without the need of a PC, certainly a big plus for the more _non-tech_ of consumers. Using the same 3G network as advanced cell phones, the Kindle delivers content using the Amazon Whispernet wireless delivery system. Unlike WiFi, you’ll never need to locate a hotspot. There are no confusing service plans, yearly contracts, or monthly wireless bills—Amazon take care of the hassles so you can just read.

Along with regular books this new service will allow you to have your newspaper subscriptions delivered via wireless each morning along with magazines. There is also an option for receiving your blog feeds.Becuase all this extra technology will hit the battery life, it may not be for everyone. Without a doubt, the keyboard will be a huge plus for many users.

> Three years ago, we set out to design and build an entirely new class of device—a convenient, portable reading device with the ability to wirelessly download books, blogs, magazines, and newspapers. The result is Amazon Kindle.
