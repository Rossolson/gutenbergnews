Books Index update from #240 to #251.

Project Gutenberg has been bringing you Free Electronic Texts since 1971
when there were only about 100 people on the Internet, we hope for more.

Project Gutenberg has reached number 250 in its goal to bring you 10,000
Etexts through the Electronic Public Library Association on the Internet
and off. Many of the books we were planning on bringing you were voided from
the Public Domain by the 1975 US Copyright Act, and we were told we would
have to wait an additional 19 years for them at that time.

For instance, both Winnie-the-Pooh and Hemingway came out in the middle-
1920s, and should have entered the Public Domain no longer than 56 years
later under their orginal copyrights. However, before that could happen in
the early 1980s, things were changed after the fact to make copyright on
these works last for an additional 19 years, for a 75 year total.

House Bill 989 and Senate Bill 483 are once again seeking to extend this
effort to keep materials out of the Public Domain, this time for another
20 years in addition to the first 28 year extension, the second 19 year,
and now another 20 years, for a total of 67 years of extensions on those
original 28 year copyright terms.

Enough said, it should be obvious that if laws such as this continued to
be passed every 20 years or so, that nothing will ever enter into Public
Domain status again and the work of people such as the Internet Wiretap,
the Online Book Initiative, and Project Gutenberg will soon be over, and
no literature or information newer than 1919 will ever be free to send a
whole world of people over the Internet.

Now that we finally have the capacity to create and distribute all these
materials for Unlimited Distribution, it is obvious there are efforts to
keep anyone from doing it. As I have said so many times before, "We are all
going to have the ability to store the Library of Congress on drives that
will be available during our lifetimes. . .but I am not sure that a society
based on Limited Distribution will let us do it."

You may notice that the newest item on this list may help you to voice a
personal opinion about this to Congress, and I urge you to do so whether
your vote is pro or con.

I have just completed 24 years on the Internet, and 48 years on Earth; I
would ask any of you who would be willing to give me a birthday present,
on having completed 2/3 of my expected lifetime, to make some effort for
the continuation of works such as Project Gutenberg in our future. This will
do more to improve the human condition than anything else I can do.

Please try to find a site close to you for accessing Project Gutenberg Etexts.
mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu is getting clogged!!

Here is a partial listing of some of the ftp sites and BBS's carrying the
Project Gutenberg Etexts. As always, the final authority is mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu,
but we would thank you to try at lease a couple of these before trying us
because this site is getting grossly overloaded sometimes, and even I can
not get in all the time to put in the new Etexts.

New Listings:

http://www.technet.sg/singapore-server.html

http://www.np.ac.sg:9080

nptn.org cd /pub/e.text/gutenberg 192.190.49.8

The College Board BBS in Sunset, SC (803) 878-7340?

This list is far from complete, and undoubtedly inaccurate!! Any corrections,
additions or deletions would be appreciated very much, and included in later
listings. Locations of the servers would be nice, so people could increase
efficiency a little bit for the Internet as whole. I have entered some--
but don't know them all.

Included first are US ftp sites, then world ftp sites. Next are BBSs for
the US and the world.

If anyone would care to volunteer to maintain this list just let me know.
