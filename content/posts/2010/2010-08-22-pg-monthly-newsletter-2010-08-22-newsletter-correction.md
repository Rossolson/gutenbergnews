<pre>The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter Extra--Aug. 22, 2010
eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


The cd at pglaf.org address was discontinued as it was getting too much spam.

The best way for someone to get a CD or DVD is to visit

http://gutenberg.org/cdproject

They should only email cd2010 at pglaf.org if they have a problem with
the web-based request form.
