<pre>The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter Extra--Aug. 16, 2010
eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971

As we progress through our 40th year of Project Gutenberg eBooks
we would like to hear from you [now, if possible], what you want
Project to have done by our 50th year, and perhaps even beyond.


Thanks so much!!!
