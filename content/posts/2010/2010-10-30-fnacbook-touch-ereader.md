The biggest bookstore chain in France is about to release their very own eReader. Although not the first eReader to come from France (Cybook has that honor), the <a title="New fnacbook Touch eReader" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gutenbergnews.org/out.php?id=fnacbook-touch&c=post1143">new <em>Fnacbook Touch</em></a> is the first to be released solely into the French market.

The hardware will seem pretty familiar to most; 6-inch E-Ink touch screen, WiFi and 3G, but the design is quite different; the looks are more playful than they are _sleek design_, and I have to say it looks pretty cool!

To coincide with the launch, fnac will be making 80,000 French titles available, which will cost around 20-30% less than their paper counterparts. Like Amazon, fnac will also be releasing an iPhone app (November) and an Android app in the first half of 2011.

Fnacbook is being released on November 10<sup>th</sup> for 199 euro, around $277 USD. Quite a high price tag, although there are more expensive eReaders out there.
