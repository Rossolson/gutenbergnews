40th Year Special Project!!!


Not Whitewashers. . .maybe blackwasher???



Improved Support For Our Project Gutenberg Volunteers


As a tribute to our volunteers we would like to make an
extraordinary effort to thank them for all their effort
over these four decades with a program to make the work
less onerous and more easy to do.

If you, or anyone you know, has any suggestions, of how
we can make the work go more smoothly, more easily, and
improve things for our volunteers in any manner, please
answer this Newsletter and let us know.

As one particular part of this program I would like for
us to create a new kind of "Blue-washers" group for the
specific purpose of helping our volunteers with problem
areas specific to them.  i.e. some volunteers just have
one or two specific production areas at which they balk
at certain procedures that are insisted upon and that's
all the prevents them from being *perfect volunteers.*

If any of you are willing to help me help them overcome
such problem areas, I would be extremely grateful!!!

Sometimes these are a simple as helping someone who has
their margins counted in millimeters instead of inches,
or who simply can't get their mind quite wrapped around
certain details our post production people insist upon;
other times it might just be a language gap where these
volunteers don't quite have the same command of English
as those who are trying to teach them.

If you feel you have the ability to make up for some of
these or other small difficulties that are all the keep
some of our volunteers from really taking off, you will
be more than welcome.


Thank you so much!!!

Project Gutenberg,
Inventor of eBooks


PS  The term "Blue-washers" is a combination of terms:

"Blue Pencil" is the publisher/editor term for comments
to writers about how to improve various article, essay,
or even book length submissions.

"Whitewasher" is a term I invented long ago to name the
people who supported me in my Project Gutenberg efforts
after I realized I could not continue being the last of
the editors to see each and every book and to put these
all online myself after about #4,000.

NB  Two people, including our CEO tried to help me with
this this for about a month at a time, but each said it
not something they ever wanted to do again.  So, kudos,
and plenty of them, to those who are willing to be last
in the lineup to take the ultimate responsibility of an
eBook's final content, format and appearance!!!

However we should add that Greg Newby and I have always
championed the fact that some of our volunteers should/
would/could be able to have their eBooks published with
no interference from anyone else, rules or not, with an
exception for obvious spelling and formatting errors.

We have always had a few such volunteers that we took a
personal hand in helping through the process, for those
various reasons listed above, or many others.

We have some who submit perhaps one book per month, and
others that take a year or longer between books.

Please let me know if you are willing to help.




We are currently giving away about 100,000 books a week
Just through the one single site:  http://gutenberg.org
About 3 million eBooks per month or 36 million per year


300th Spanish eBook is coming up!!!

Please send in your suggestions for title #300!!!



Please note TWO new Project Gutenberg web pages below--
new features, new search engines, etc.  Please test and
make comments, suggestions, etc.



31 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring
on December 21, 2012 [some now saying October 11, 2011]

Leaving 2 years 7 months, 10 1/3 seasons, or 31 months.
[Leaving 1 year 5 months, 5 2/3 seasons, or 17 months.]
[All bracketed figures minus 10 days, of course.]

Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions,
such as that there will be affordable petabytes [2021],
and enough eBooks to fill an entire petabyte around the
same time.  Current long range prediction for drives:
1 petabyte drives in 2025, possibly even in 2022, along
with 1 terabyte solid state drives [SSDs].  1 petabyte=
enough storage for every word ever published, 1 billion
books of 1 million characters each.

May 21, 2010 to December 21, 2012 is 31 Months.

May 21, 2010 to October 11, 2011 is 17 Months -10 days.






Request:

1894 Dr. Johnson Edition of:
The Complete Works of Shakespeare collection.
Missing volumes 2 & 6.  Got all the other volumes for a
couple dollars at a garage sale, but will pay 20 dollars
each for for volumes 2 & 6.





GENERATION CHANGE

I got a book this week called "Generation Change," that
lists "150 Ways We Can Change Ourselves, Our Country,
and Our World."  Most of these 150 items come with some
suggestion of sites to visit on the Internet.  #1 is:

PROJECT GUTNBERG!!!!!!!

"Generation Change" is available from:

http://www.skyhorsepublishing.com





Help create the  "http://m.gutenberg.org"  web pages!!!

We are working on making all our eBooks optimized to do
their best on iPads, iPhones, iPods, cellphones and PDA
devices, and to do our web pages to the same degree.

Let us know if you have any of these and can test them,
or would like to optimize for any other devices.

There are 4.5 billion such devices in the world, versus
only 1.15 billion computers, and more and more readers,
in spite of what the pundits say, are surfing, reading,
and everything else on such mobile devices.

More and more such devices will ONLY surf to "m" sites
such as "m.gutenberg.org"



In Our Own News Bin


New Project Gutenberg Web Pages


We have two new Project Gutenberg web sites up for testing.

I think you will find some interesting additional searching
and expanded lists of other eBook sites worth trying out:

http://gutenberg.trulymail.comi


and another new effort at:


http://domainunltd.weebly.com/

Details:

The goal I'm aiming at with this initiative is twofold.

I'd like to provide as much useful information as possible
about e-books (freely) available on the web, where to find them.

And secondly, to offer people the opportunity to help out,
producing e-text for PG, in first instance by doing a first
round of proofreading on texts I deliver.

People who want to do more are welcome to and can count on help
in going through the process from start to finish.

Experienced proofers who enjoy working on a complete book
are also very welcome.

APPROACHING NEWS. . . .


ONGOING U.S. COPYRIGHT EXTENSIONS

U.S. COPYRIGHTS TO BE EXTENDED TO 115 YEARS,
DECADE BY DECADE FROM THE ORIGINAL 14 YEARS!

THE SUPREME COURT SAYS IT NEVER HAS TO STOP!!!

Suggestions are more than welcome how to publicize this
upcoming event before it even starts to happen!!!


Apparently everyone is keeping silent about the various
copyright extensions coming up in Canada and the U.S.

In just a few years yet another bill will be introduced
in the U.S. Congress to extend copyright that has quite
literally been extended from 14 years to 115 years.




Here's Why We Need To Start Before The Issue Arises!!!



When the last Australian Copyright Act was discussed in
Parliament, they passed a resolution stating they would
NOT extend copyrights.

Really.

However, just three years later, under economic warfare
from, shall we just say, outside sources, they crumbled
to the pressure and gave in.


The Canadian Parliament is currently in that position--
and while some tell me they have enough signatures from
those against any extensions, I will bet you lunch that
they, too, crumble before it is over.

I would gladly lose every one of those wagers!!!



Further Information


As you may already know, any time the copyrights in the
characters Winnie the Pooh [1926], or The Mouse [1928],
start coming close to expiration The U.S. Congress will
be sure to start a very quiet frenzy of copyright bills
that are designed to go into effect before anything can
happen to those two copyrights.

As I understand it, Disney(R) made a huge lobby effort,
successful, to create the 1976 U.S. Copyright Act; paid
as a result an additional $200 million for the right to
another 20 years of Winnie the Pooh, and still made the
fabled laughing trip to the bank as a result, since the
effective date of 1978.

As a result I have to imagine their sales of The Mouse,
Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, etc., must have been predicted
to be so terribly large as to devour Avatar's gross.

Given that next bill passed right in the middle of what
must have been the busiest day in Congress for the last
few decades, the impeachment of President Clinton, this
means we should expect something of equal secrecy quite
soon, as the current copyright extension runs out 2018.

Usually they would make an effort to pass the new one a
session or two early, such as in 2016, but given that a
snag or two has hit before, we should probably look out
starting in 2015, though it will be hard to see.

Why?

Even during the election just before the last extension
I went to ask televised press conference questions on a
new U.S. Copyright Act I had heard about, but candidate
responses were uniform. . ."I know nothing."

I would have to expect that even if the big anchors ask
the same question in 2015 they will get that answer.

Or non-answer.

&gt;From what I have heard there is an ever larger movement
to keep everything copyrighted permanently, and to make
all media as pay-per-view as possible, to the points of
making all broadcast television pay-per-view on a first
viewing premise [except public stations].

We are very likely to see a dissolving out boundaries--
cable products showing up on network television and the
opposite direction as well.

What else CAN we expect when Comcast cable has been the
allowed buyer of NBC?

If you think programming won't leak over:

Consider what happened when Disney took over ABC.

Not only did Disney flood ABC with their own programmed
output, but they killed off the best of all cartoons.

Anyone remember Reboot?


I can put you in touch with many copyright experts, and
I fear that all of them underestimate the power working
to make copyright permanent, in spite of the fact words
"limited time" are the U.s. Constitution's description.

However, the U.s. Supreme Court decided that limited is
really unlimited in "Eldred v Ashcroft."



Welcome To Our Newest PG Mirror. . .In Africa!!!

Continent: Africa

PROJECT GUTENBERG TAG CLOUD

We invite interested persons to visit a tag cloud visualization and
search system at www.bookdownloadlibrary.com

This is updated weekly, from the Project Gutenberg catalog.


iPHONE SOUGHT

Project Gutenberg is seeking donation of an iPhone, and perhaps
other modern cell phones and eBook readers.  We are working on some
new versions of content at www.gutenberg.org

These need to work, including in Europe , but without having a paid
cell phone plan.  In other words, they need to be unlocked or
unlockable.  We are particularly interested in devices that have
built-in WiFi, so they can access content at www.gutenberg.org
without using the cellular network at all.

Project Gutenberg is a charitable 501(c)(3) organization in the US.



Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!


FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The ideal piece around which to center this collection is
one of the 8 megabyte USBs.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the
Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems
and these were OEMed by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular
in a recognizable fashion because their snapon connectors
resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

We received two examples of RAM actually labeled "Flash,"
for the H-P 95 pocket DOS machine from 1991, and a sample
of Fairchild bubble memory, as well, from down under.

Thank you, Mate!



POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.





Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and
totals from PG of Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at
