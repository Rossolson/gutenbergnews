Latin Is A Dying Language???
Latin Library (www.thelatinlibrary.com) died,
and was resurrected recently, bring attention
to the fact that we need to save these files,
find matching paper editions, and be sure the
files don't disappear.

If you would like to help with Latin eBooks,
please let me know.

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to only ONE DVD burner, on a laptop
belonging to a personal friend.  If you have a DVD burner
or plan to get one in the next 6 months, please email me,
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November while
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

We are seeking pro bono or very cheap legal assistance to pursue
Project Gutenberg trademark infringers and similar issues.  Please
email Michael Hart &lt;hart@pobox.com&gt;.

[We received 3 replies from the US, 1 from Australia, but
may need more around December 10.]

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 28 weeks of this year, we have produced 1962 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 1962 eBooks!!!

         That's 28 WEEKS as Compared to 28 YEARS!!!


With 8,705 eBooks online as of July 16, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.15 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.80 when we had 5556 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 8,700+ books each costing $.65 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 8,700+ books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 8705 eBooks in 32 Years and 00.50 Months We Averaged
    272 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     23 Per Month
    .75 Per Day

At 1962 eBooks Done In The 196 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     10 Per Day
     70 Per Week
    302 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.
This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[Editor's Comments In Brackets]

From Newsscan

FREE SPAM BUSTER TOPS CONSUMER REPORTS LIST
Consumer Reports has rated a free program distributed by an obscure
California startup as its top pick among the spam-blocking software it
recently tested. SAProxy, developed by Stata Labs, earned a near-perfect
score in correctly identifying nonspam messages and directing them to
users' in-boxes. But the software was slightly less accurate in blocking
unsolicited junk e-mail, earning an 80% accuracy rate. Some of the other
software tested edged toward 90% accuracy in that category. The magazine
looked at nine add-on programs and two e-mail programs with built-in
spam-blocking features, and devised tests using 500 spam messages and 225
nonspam messages. The runners-up were SpamCatcher Universal, Spam Sleuth
and Symantec's Spam Alert. The testing methodology didn't allow testing of
the spam-blocking features in AOL, MSN and Yahoo. In general, the winning
feature in the best spam-blocking programs tested was "the ability to rate
messages based on a variety of criteria rather than narrow criteria," said
Dean Gallea, who led the tests. (Wall Street Journal 9 Jul 2003)

SENATE PUTS THE SQUEEZE ON TIA FUNDING
U.S. senators deliberating over next year's defense budget have proposed
eliminating all funding the Defense Department's Terrorism Information
Awareness project. The TIA project, under the supervision of retired Adm.
John Poindexter, seeks to develop computer software capable of scanning
vast public and private databases of commercial transactions and personal
data around the world to ferret out possible terrorist activities. The
committee's proposal "reflects deep, deep skepticism in Congress of the
Pentagon's assurances about this system," says a spokesman for the Center
for Democracy and Technology. "There appears to be some spillover
skepticism from Iraq where they voted to go to war and now are questioning
whether that was based on clever use of words or selective use of
intelligence." (AP 15 Jul 2003)

BUY.COM'S NEW MUSIC DOWNLOAD SERVICE
Buy.com, a mainstream Internet shopping site, will soon be offering a new
music download service that (like the Apple iTunes Music Store) will sell
individual music tracks without collecting an up-front monthly subscription
fee. Since Apple has not yet developed a Windows version of its service,
the PC music market offers a broad target for a company such as Buy.com,
which will try to surpass its much larger rival, Amazon.com, which has 34.5
million monthly visitors compared to Buy.com's 3.1 million, according to
Nielsen/NetRatings. (San Jose Mercury News 16 Jul 2003)

TALKING CLOTHES: HARMLESS CHIT-CHAT OR VICIOUS GOSSIP?
RFID technology (the acronym stands for "radio frequency identification"),
which embeds tiny computer chips and radio antennae into products and
transmits inventory and supply-chain data to manufacturers and retailers,
is being criticized by Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center: "Simply stated, I don't think most people want their clothes spying
on them. It's also clear that there could be some very invasive uses of
these techniques if merchants use the tracking technology to spy on their
customers after purchase." In rebuttal, Ron Margulis of the National
Grocers Association says that privacy concerns are far outweighed by the
benefits of RFID, which could help retailers respond much more quickly to
product recalls and prevent people from becoming ill from tainted products:
"You do give up a bit of privacy but the benefit could be that you live."
(AP/USA TODAY 9 Jul 2003)
http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-07-08-rfid-chip_x.htm

WAL-MART CANCELS 'SMART-SHELF' TRIAL
Bowing to criticism from consumer privacy groups, Wal-Mart has canceled
what was billed as the biggest trial yet of a so-called smart-shelf system
that would use RFID sensors to pick up data transmitted by microchips in
partner Gillette's product packaging. The system would then alert store
managers via computer when stock was running low or when items may have
been stolen. A Gillette representative declined to comment on Wal-Mart's
decision, but said it plans to focus on helping UK supermarket chain Tesco
and German retailer Metro conduct similar trials in Europe. Meanwhile,
Wireless Data Research Group analyst Ian McPherson says privacy advocates'
concerns were likely overblown: "Consumers that are aware of RFID and
privacy feel it is very significant, and they are probably more concerned
than they should be. The likelihood that people can be tracked beyond the
check stand is very low." A recent Gartner poll showed 55% of the consumers
polled said they would shop in stores using RFID technology if it meant
faster checkouts, and only about 16% said they would probably or definitely
stop shopping at such a store. Twenty-eight percent were undecided. (CNet

DELL REVAMPS RECYCLING PROGRAM
Bowing to criticism by environmentalists and workers rights groups, Dell
Computer has overhauled its PC recycling program, and is now charging as
little as $49 to dispose of computers safely, without dumping hazardous
materials in U.S. or developing countries' landfills and without using
prison labor. Up until last week, Dell shipped used computers to UNICOR,
which uses prison laborers to disassemble the machines. As part of the
recycling process, Dell will also strip the hard drives of confidential
data in a process called "three times data override." Customers who need
further protection -- such as hospitals or banks -- may pay extra for the
hard drives to be destroyed. (AP 10 Jul 2003)

A SEARCH ENGINE FOR THE WORLD'S POOR
Researchers at MIT are designing a search engine geared to the needs of
computer users in the world's disadvantaged countries, most of whom have
only sporadic access to the Web at what are often less-than-optimal
bandwidths. "Let us assume you are in Malawi," says professor Saman
Amarasinghe of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science, "and the computer lab
does not have access to the telephone line all the time. If you want to
find some new information about malaria, you are prompted with a message
that says 'we are going to send a query through e-mail, is it OK?'. At
night, when the phone line is available, the teacher can dial out and send
the queries." The request is routed to computers at MIT, which then perform
the search and filter the results, choosing the most relevant. These
results are then sent back to the computer in Malawi. "Next morning the
teacher can connect, download that e-mail and when the students arrive,
they can browse through those pages the way they would if they had full
Internet connectivity." Amarasinghe says most search engines are geared
toward Western users who are cash-rich but time-poor. "The idea is
that developing countries are willing to pay in time for knowledge.
In the West when we surf we want the information in the next two seconds.
We are not willing to wait."

ISPS, MARKETERS OPPOSE ANTI-SPAM LEGISLATION
Some Internet service providers (ISPs), including Microsoft and America
Online, have lobbied against passage of tough anti-spam laws, while
direct marketers have threatened court challenges of such legislation.
Despite the pressure, members of Congress say they are determined to
pass an anti-spam bill this year, although some bill sponsors admit
they wish their bills had stronger provisions. Of the dozen or so bills
under review by Congress, many include an opt-out provision for
consumers who do not want to receive messages from a particular sender.
Critics object to this approach, preferring an opt-in provision. ISPs
and direct marketers also oppose creation of a Do Not Spam list, which
would allow e-mail users to opt out of receiving any unsolicited e-mail.

SENATE ALLOWS NO FUNDS FOR TIA
The U.S. Senate may effectively kill the controversial Terrorism
Information Awareness (TIA) program (formerly the Total Information
Awareness program) through a budget that forbids funding the program.
Republican Senator Ted Stevens spearheaded the addition of language to
the Senate's defense appropriations bill that explicitly disallows any
money to be used for the program, which has been criticized from
privacy groups as well as legislators on both sides of the aisle. The
bill is likely to pass a Senate vote, at which time a committee will
attempt to reconcile the Senate's appropriations bill with that of the
House, whose version does not include the ban on spending for TIA.
Observers expect that opponents of TIA will succeed in killing the program.

SENATE PUTS THE BRAKES ON CAPPS II
The Senate Appropriations Committee has voted to restrict all funding
for the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II)
until the General Accounting Office provides evidence of the program's
impact on privacy. The CAPPS II program was designed to perform
background checks on all airline passengers, including looking at
criminal records and credit reports, and to assign each passenger a
threat level. Depending on the level assigned, some passengers would
undergo increased screening at the airport, while others would not be
allowed to fly. Opponents of the program argue that it opens to door to
violations of individuals' civil liberties and their personal privacy.
In March, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced legislation requiring
government officials to investigate those concerns. The Department of
Homeland Security has reportedly stopped its testing of the CAPPS II
program pending an internal review of privacy policy.
