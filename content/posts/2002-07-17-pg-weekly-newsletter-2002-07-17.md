Announcements:

I have about 15 books in French fresh from the Smithsonian research
rooms ready to go to anyone who can scan them and proof them.

To whom should I send them?

It might be worth noting that the texts are most French grammer
books or early readers, so it is not exactly thrilling material.

In the first 28 weeks of the new year, we have produced 1,264 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,556 eTexts online as of July 17th, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.80 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.73 when we had 3664 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,555 books each costing $.93 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,555 books each costing 30% less a year later???

At 5556 eBooks in 31 Years We Averaged
  179 Per Year

At 1264 eBooks Done In 2002 We Averaged
  200 eBooks Per Month!!!

[My Comments In Brackets]

Headlines From Newsscan

THE AMAZING SHRINKING WARRANTY
It's not just your imagination -- planned obsolescence has become a firmly
entrenched marketing strategy for most makers of electronic equipment. "We
joke that we design landfills," says a senior industrial engineer at
Pentagram Design, which builds portable devices and computers for companies
like Hewlett-Packard. In the past year Dell Computer has slashed warranty
periods from three years to one, and Apple's iPod digital-music player
features only a 90-day warranty. Sony requires buyers to fill out a lengthy
questionnaire in order to qualify for a full year of support on a Clie
organizer -- otherwise they get only 90 days. At the same time, companies
are making it more difficult to get items repaired, even if the customer is
willing to pay for it. Many PDAs from companies such as Handspring, Palm
and HP have built-in rechargeable batteries that generally can't be
replaced without shipping the whole unit off to the manufacturer -- a
"feature" that lands many of them in the rubbish heap. Part of the problem
is a much shorter new-product cycle, which has sharply reduced the amount
of time allotted for testing. The result is that things break much more
often. Add to that today's much lower prices combined with prohibitively high
repair costs, and many customers just opt to replace anything that breaks.

WEB RADIO STATIONS OBJECT TO PAYING ROYALTIES
Told last month by a federal court that they would have to pay seven
one-hundredths of a cent in royalties to record companies every time one of
its listeners hears a copyrighted song transmitted over the Web, a group of
radio stations led by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and
Clear Channel Communications is appealing that ruling to a higher court.
The appeal challenges the right presumed right of the Copyright Office to
set the royalty rates. (Bloomberg/New York Times 17 Jul 2002)

THE NEW LANGUAGE OF THE WEB
An e-mail security filter used by Yahoo has spawned a bizarre revision of
the text in hundreds of Web sites by deleting letter combinations that
could be used by hackers and replacing them with innocuous words. For
example, "eval" has been converted to "review", so that the word "medieval"
now appears as "medireview" on many sites. A recent search conducted by
British Internet site NTK found that 640 different Web sites now contain
the word "medireview" in place of "medieval." The offending words, which
also include "mocha" (changed to "espresso") and "expression" (replaced by
"statement"), are blacklisted because they could be used for cross-site
scripting -- embedding potentially dangerous code into a Web page or an
e-mail message written in HTML. (New Scientist 15 Jul 2002)

SHA-MAIL
Cell phone photos ("sha-mail," from the Japanese word shashin for
photography) are all the rage in Japan, and the Sharp Corporation, a
pioneer in camera-equipped cell phones, is leading the industry. ING
analyst Hitoshi Hayakawa says, "Whether or not a handset has a camera
attached is a major factor in purchasing decisions. Choosing camera phones
over non-camera phones is becoming the leading trend in the industry." The
expectation is that by March 2003 one in every three handsets in Japan will
have a camera attached. (Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 16 Jul 2002)

DVD STATS
A trade association for the video software industry has released the
billion; DVD sales passed VHS tape sales, which fell 9% to $4.9 billion;
renters spent $7 billion on tapes, down 26%, and $1.4 billion on discs, up
100%;  and just 25% of homes have players, with that figure expected to
reach 35% expected by year's end. (USA Today 16 Jul 2002)

FTC 'TEASER' SITES TAKE AIM AT UNWARY CONSUMERS
The Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission
have teamed up to create some number of "teaser" sites that pop up among
the results on search engines when users type in requests for everything
from "free vacations" to "erectile dysfunction cures." The teaser sites
open with a page featuring "too-good-to-be-true" offers, and then when the
unsuspecting user clicks for details, the screen switches to a young man
holding out his hand to say "Stop!" with the headline "You could get
scammed!". FTC attorney Eric Wenger says the ads represent the agency's
attempt to reach consumers before they are victims of fraud. "We want to
try to reach out to them and give them information that they can use to
critically evaluate offers that they are receiving. And allow them to
recognize and avoid deception before falling victim to it." He says the
sites are designed to educate and empower consumers, not to make them feel
silly or like they've been "had." The sites also provide links to complaint
forms and tips provided by the FTC at www.ftc.gov. (CNN.com 11 Jul 2002)

PRETTY POOR PRIVACY FROM NETWORK ASSOCIATES
A computer security company has uncovered a flaw in PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) -- a freely distributed, public key encryption system that's used
to scramble e-mail messages -- that could allow malicious users to
unscramble sensitive messages. The flaw is found only in PGP plug-ins for
Microsoft Outlook users distributed by Network Associates. "The PGP
vulnerability enables an attacker to send a specially crafted e-mail to any
Outlook address enabled with the PGP plug-in, which will in turn give them
access to that system," says eEye Digital Security, which discovered the
problem. EEye chief hacking officer Marc Maiffret says the flaw allows an
attacker to do "anything a user of that machine could do -- copy files,
delete files, install a backdoor." Gartner research director for Internet
security John Pescatore says, "This vulnerability means people using [the
affected] version of PGP actually are less secure than if they weren't
using security at all. It's always a really, really bad thing when a
security product has a bug." (NewsFactor Network 11 Jul 2002)

CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS GOOD, NOT BAD
Defending well-connected Stanford University president John Hennessy from
critics who charge him with having conflicts of interests, venture
'greasing' metaphor, but that's the way the world works. Conflict of
interest is good, it is not bad." Tight connections are in fact what have
allowed Silicon Valley to achieve the level of success envied throughout
the world. Hennessy stresses that there's an important distinction between
merely "perceived" or "possible" conflicts and actual actions that conflict
with the interests of his employer. "University policies require you to
disclose possible conflicts. That is exactly the method I use." Ethicist
encourages the careers of people they know. And if they're doing well, they
invest in them... I don't see any conflict of interest of significant
concern here." (San Jose Mercury News 11 Jul 2002)

SEARCH ENGINES SLOW TO IDENTIFY SPONSOR-DRIVEN RESULTS
A new survey by the Associated Press has found that most search engines,
with the prominent exception of Google, have not met the Federal Trade
Commission's guidelines for building "clear and conspicuous" distinctions
between fee-based results and those produced by objective formulas. Only
Google met all the FTC criteria for clarity and openness. Search engines
that failed to meet one or more of the criteria included Alltheweb, AOL,
AltaVista, AskJeeves, Hotbot, Looksmart, Lycos, MSN, Overture, Netscape,
and Yahoo. Gary Ruskin, the executive director of the consumer watchdog
not their search results are being bought by big business."

of history and science (a knowledge of production) for knowledge
of products and how such products interlock to form coherent
social patterns (a knowledge of consumption). James B. Twitchell

RECYCLING LAW COULD MEAN PRICEY PCs IN EUROPE
The price of computers in Europe could rise by $50 apiece once new
environmental laws are enacted that mandate the recycling of old machines.
"IT directors should be warning the board that they will be expected to pay
for this in their acquisition costs," says Gartner researcher Brian
Gammage. "People will start looking at leasing options and per seat
options, especially in larger companies, as a way to overcome these costs."
Meanwhile, a director of one recycling firm says problems could emerge
because manufacturers aren't yet ready to deal with the huge numbers of old
computers they'll have to handle when they sell new ones to large
companies. "What will happen to the equipment that corporations are getting
rid of? Because they will be getting rid of thousands of machines at a
time." (BBC News 11 Jul 2002)

more protection from the Net problems such as virii, spam, etc....]

Headlines From Edupage:

COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION WOULD LIMIT RIGHTS
Reps. Howard Coble of North Carolina and Howard Berman of California
have drafted a bill that could potentially put severe limits on fair
use while giving Webcasters something of a reprieve. Currently, the
doctrine of fair use allows consumers to make copies of copyrighted
content for specific purposes, including educational and other
nonprofit activities. The bill, as currently drafted, would end the
exemption that allows this copying. But the bill would make legal the
temporary copies that Webcasters must use to broadcast files over the
Internet. Some groups have complained that these temporary copies
violate copyright. Civil rights and academic groups oppose the
restrictions on fair use in the bill, and some noted that the exemption
for Webcasters would be moot if Congress enacts a royalty schedule,
which could force many Webcasters out of business.
CNET, 11 July 2002

FLAW EXPOSED IN PGP
Researchers at eEye Digital Security Inc. have revealed a critical flaw
in the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook. Marc Maiffret of
eEye said the flaw is fairly inconspicuous, but it could allow a hacker
total access to a user's system. The problem is that PGP mishandles
certain types of e-mails. By sending an e-mail with the necessary
malicious code to Outlook users with the plug-in, hackers could execute
harmful programs, read victims' e-mail, access encryption keys for
other data, or, as Maiffret said, "do whatever you want." Maiffret
taken extra steps to be secure. Network Associates, which until
recently distributed PGP, has posted a free patch on its Web site
(http://www.nai.com/).

STANFORD PRESIDENT LINKS STUDENTS WITH INVESTORS
John Hennessy has a long history of involvement with technology
start-ups and venture capitalists. As the current president of Stanford
University, situated in the heart of Silicon Valley, Hennessy uses his
connections and influence to connect student and faculty projects with
potential investors when he sees a project he considers promising. But
because Hennessy invests his own money in some of the venture capital
firms involved with student and faculty projects, some have complained
of potential conflicts of interest. According to critics, even the
perception that Hennessy might profit from his position casts a shadow
on his credibility. Hennessy and the chairman of Stanford's Board of
Trustees dismiss the complaints, saying that Hennessy complies with all
of the disclosure regulations. They also said that the potential for
conflict is quite small, given that Hennessy's investments are with a
diverse portfolio of clients, not tied directly to any specific project.
