  The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation plan to donate at least $60 million over the next three years to improve schools in third-world countries. The Gates Foundation will give $40 million to the Hewlett Foundation, which will contribute $20 million to the project. Said Hewlett Foundation President Paul Brest, "It is the first time in our history that we have received a grant from another institution." Sylvia Mathews, president of the Gates Foundation global development program, said that the grant is the largest they have given another grant-making organization. She said her foundation was eager to bolster education in developing nations but realized they would be more successful if they worked with an organization that already had expertise in the field.<em>San Jose Mercury News, 18 December 2006</em><br /> <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/16266719.htm" target="_blank">http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/16266719.htm</a>
