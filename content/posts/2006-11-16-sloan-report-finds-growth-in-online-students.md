    The latest survey of online learning by the Sloan Consortium reported that about 3.2 million students took at least one online course from a degree-granting institution in fall 2005, double the number who did in 2002. The report, issued jointly by the Sloan Consortium and the College Board, defines an online course as one in which at least 80 percent of the content is delivered over the Internet. The rate of growth of online students slowed from 2003 to 2004 despite a continuing upward trend. In contrast, only one in four academic leaders said their faculty have embraced online education, a number that has persisted through four surveys.
