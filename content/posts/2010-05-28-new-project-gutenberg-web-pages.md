We have two new Project Gutenberg web sites up for testing. I think you will find some interesting additional searching and expanded lists of other eBook sites worth trying out:

http://gutenberg.trulymail.com

and another new effort at:

http://domainunltd.weebly.com/

### Details

The goal I'm aiming at with this initiative is twofold.

I'd like to provide as much useful information as possible about e-books (freely) available on the web, where to find them.

And secondly, to offer people the opportunity to help out, producing e-text for PG, in first instance by doing a first round of proofreading on texts I deliver.

People who want to do more are welcome to and can count on help in going through the process from start to finish.

Experienced proofers who enjoy working on a complete book are also very welcome.
