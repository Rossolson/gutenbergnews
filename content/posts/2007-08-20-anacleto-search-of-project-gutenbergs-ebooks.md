Gutenberg volunteers & other interested folks: Here's something new to try. It's a search engine that includes fielded searches, plus text, for the PG content. It enables searching the files (as Google does), and parses the catalog for database-style searches (like our Yahoo search). It's fresh.

Please email Anna Tothfalusi (atothfalusi@tesuji.eu) with any feedback or questions.

**The site:**

<a href="http://bookmine.tesuji.eu/gutenberg/" target="new">bookmine.tesuji.eu/gutenberg/</a>

The interface is sparse, but the "help" link shows syntax examples..."Advanced search" offers some drop-downs. Ideas for the interface, search functionality, etc. would be welcome.

I hope to make this one of the PG search options at gutenberg.org.

Thanks in advance for feedback & ideas.

â€” Greg
