    Upon signing up for an e-mail subscription, the reader receives a chapter a day with the option to read further on the ArcaMax website. The email subscriptions can be adjusted to match the place in the book so the reader can go further and have the next email adjusted accordingly. This feature is also useful for a reader who may fall behind in the book (based on the default reading schedule of one chapter per day).

      While the ArcaMax books by email function has been around for only a year, ArcaMax Publishing (<a href="http://www.arcamax.com" target="_blank">http://www.arcamax.com</a>) has been sending out newsletters by e-mail since 1999. Sending classic books by email was a natural transition for the company.

        All ArcaMax content (including classic books) is advertising supported, which allows for content to be provided at no cost to the reader. The company also offers email without advertising for readers who may prefer to have no solicitations anywhere near the text.
