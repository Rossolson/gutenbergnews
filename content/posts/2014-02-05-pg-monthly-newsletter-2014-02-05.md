CONTENTS

* Missing newsletter

This is an abbreviated newsletter for January/February 2014.  We had a
disk failure in late January that displaced my newsletter notes
containing the new content I had intended to share, but I have no
excuse for missing the January newsletter.

Below are the new eBook listings for December 2013 and January 2014,
with thanks to Larry for assembling these listings.

And, with great thanks to the wonderful readers and volunteers of
Project Gutenberg.  Visit www.gutenberg.org to find great books.
Visit www.pgdp.net, the Project Gutenberg Distributed Proofreaders, to
help produce our future eBooks.
