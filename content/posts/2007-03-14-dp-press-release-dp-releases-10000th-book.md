Today the Project Gutenberg [Distributed Proofreaders](http://www.pgdp.net) (DP) posted a package of texts that takes us over 10,000 completed titles. I'm very proud of our community of volunteers who have accomplished this fantastic number. The 10K package (listed below) showcases the wide range of our volunteers' interests and talents.

There are examples of a number of our on-going large projects including the Slave Narratives (now over half done), the Bureau of American Ethnography reports, periodicals (this issue of Punch is the 280th that we've done), and the beginning of a new project, Linnaeus' Species Plantarum. Children's literature and Science Fiction are two popular areas and both are represented on this list. Shakespeare in French and John Evelyn's classic work on the trees of England represent the classics. The Shanty Book has music to listen to, and the Encyclopedia of Needlework deserves its name, being so large and full of illustrations.<!--more-->

It's hard to argue which of these titles is the most significant, but I lean towards The annals of the Cakchiquels. Here is what one of the people involved with its production told me about it, "The Annals of the Cakchiquels contains the text and translation of a document written in the 17th century in Cakchiquel Maya, a Mayan language of highland Guatemala. The document begins with a history of the Cakchiquel people and continues with the history of the writer's family through the arrival of the Spanish in the area and to the date of the writing. It is one of the few documents written in Mesoamerican indigenous languages that contain the history of the people before the Spanish Conquest. The author, Daniel G. Brinton, was an early archaeologist, ethnologist, and linguist."

There are thousands of DP volunteers who have made this milestone possible. They all deserve thanks for their contributions!
