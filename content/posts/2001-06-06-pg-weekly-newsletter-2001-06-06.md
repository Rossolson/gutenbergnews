Subject: [gweekly] Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
To: "Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter" &lt;gweekly@listserv.unc.edu&gt;
Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2001 11:05:00 -0500 (CDT)


WARNING:  THIS IS A TEST OF THE NEW PROJECT GUTENBERG NEWSLETTER SERVERS
[This is the first day Newsletters are being sent in this manner, and we
hope to have a majority of any bugs worked out by our July 4th edition.
Please let us know of any suggestions or comments you may have. . . .]
[If you get an extra you didn't get before, or don't see copies in the
usual locations, please let use know!]

Some people have asked that the monthly Newsletter contain ALL of the
information contained in the weekly Newsletters, but I'm not sure this
is going to work out. . .we can certainly include all the listings for
new and revised Etexts. . .but I'm not sure if we can include all the
quotes from Newsscan and Edupage. . .and obviously some of the request
for assistance messages will be out of date if we include them.  Open
to suggestions on this, as well as the entire new formats. . .sorry I
haven't had time to really polish these up yet. . .and I felt I should
strip today's issues down to the bare minimum in case there are errors
that result in you getting extra copies. Michael S. Hart/hart@pobox.com

ENGLISH STILL RULES ON WEB, BUT TIMES ARE CHANGING
As Internet use grows worldwide, global companies will have to
start offering their Web sites in multilingual formats to reach
non-English speaking consumers as well as non-English speaking
business partners. In fact, 66 percent of e-commerce dollars
will be generated outside the U.S. over the next two years, and
non-English speaking users will be the majority on the Internet
by 2005, according to the research firm Aberdeen Group. Yahoo!
has expanded its reach to broadcast in languages native to Latin
America, China, Europe, and India. Computer Economics analyst
Michael Erbschloe argued that global companies "have no choice
but to approach it from a multiple language point of view" and
believes global business supply chains will have to operate on
a multilingual Net soon. The Aberdeen Group says 57 of U.S.
Fortune 100 companies ran multilingual sites during 2000,
nearly twice as many as in the previous year.

[As I have been predicting, the world is going to "pay per view."
Soon you won't EVER be able to OWN *ANY* copy of copyrighted materials,
and the extinct DIVX format will be reintroduced with no other option.]

"SUBSCRIPTION MODEL" THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE
Microsoft and eBay are among the first of what will become a long line of
technology companies to adopt a "subscription model" that moves away from
the idea of selling software for a one-time fee. A GigaInformation Group
analyst says, "The trend is undeniable - it's just a question of how long
it's going to take. The existing model isn't working. You can certainly try
to live in the past, but whether you're a Microsoft or an eBay, you're
probably going to get bypassed." And Arthur Newman of ABN Amro explains: "I
think the Internet over the last few years has spawned a whole generation of
people who expect to get everything for free and forget you have to pay for
services. If people can't make money providing them, they're going to stop
providing them. There's a limit to good will. Ebay is hardly alone in
starting to charge for things." (AP/Los Angeles Times 1 Jun 2001)

A Few Questions About Pay-Per-View [from various sources]

Suppose someone wants to run some searches on a pay-per-view book,
does each search consitute one reading of the book?

What if someone wants to run a concordance program on this book?

Does a word frequency test count?

What if someone wants to compare two pages over and over again in
extreme detail to see if they reinforce or contradict each other
in specific instances?

Suppose someone wants to do a thesaurus search on marriage, so a
search is done on:  wed, wedded, wedding, unwed, marriage, marry,
matrimony, marry, married, unmarried, union etc., etc., etc.

Does each search count as one "view" to be paid for?

How would one go about becoming an expert, or even more, a scholar,
of material that is released only in pay-per-view formats?

I've closed down gutnberg (it responds with a message giving
instructions on gweekly and gmonthly if anyone tries to subscribe),
and populated gweekly and gmonthly with all the subscribers.

I will send out info to both lists on how to unsubscribe etc.

Here are the new instructions you asked for:

-------- mailinglist-howto.txt

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

  gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
  gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

	subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

	subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

	unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
would like more information about Project Gutenberg, including an easy
search tool to find and read our etexts, visit the Official Web Pages
at http://promo.net/pg
