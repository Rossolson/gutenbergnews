## The TPP is signed, not yet ratified

Project Gutenberg is concerned about the negative impact of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on the public domain.  If this
international treaty is ratified and enacted, the TPP will effectively
halt growth of the public domain in most signatory countries.  There
are many other questionable aspects of the TPP.

Learn more at www.eff.org/issues/tpp and via topics presented at
Project Gutenberg of Canada, www.gutenberg.ca

There is still time to make your lawmakers aware of concerns you may
have about the TPP.
