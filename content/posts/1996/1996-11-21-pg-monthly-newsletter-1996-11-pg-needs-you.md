<pre>PG NEEDS YOU! NOVEMBER 1996

PG NEEDS YOUR HELP MORE THAN EVER

Please send your feedback directly to
Michael S. Hart hart@pobox.com

I have never been good at asking for help, but we need the help more than
ever before as you will see if you read on.

We need to get incorporated. [Therefore we need lawyers.]

25 years ago Project Gutenberg started putting information on the Internet,
years earlier than any other providers of general information, at a time
when the only people on the Internet/ARPANet were paid professionals.

[Today their continued presence on the Net is threatened.]

At that time only the geekiest of the geeks understood any of the messages
posted in the Net, and Project Gutenberg's unpaid volunteers, the first Plain
Vanilla Netizens, would change the face of the Internet forever with postings
that everyone could read and understand, for decades to come.

[And we would very much hope to continue, with your help.]

Next week Project Gutenberg plans to release #700 in their series, and at
the moment of this writing #696 has already made its way around the world;
by the time you are reading this, it is likely that #700 will already be
posted, as we are a few days ahead of schedule.

[And in only four more months we hope to be posting #1000]

While Project Gutenberg has managed to roll out book after book on schedule.
. .official release date is midnight the last day of each month. . .on time
and "under budget". . .

[From our earliest files that were limited to about 5K, to some of our most
recent files that are 45M of text, nearly 10,000 times as large as our original
files.]

BUT. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . !

the fact is that this is not likely to be able to continue without your support
because the support we used to get is changing for the worse as the old
information pathways our work created have become paved, re-paved, and finally
they have become marked with those signs that say NO PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC,
NO MOTOR DRIVEN CYCLES, NO FARM IMPLEMENTS and no anything else other than
high-cost, high-maintenance, cost ineffective behemoths in full motion video,
stereophonics, and point and click interfaces.

Let's face it. . .books on computers do not require higher technology than
was available fifteen years ago. . .unless you are searching large books.
. .but for just reading and writing books, the oldest, slowest PC is just
fine.

This kind of traffic is the most efficient for information transmission,
far more efficient than movies or markup, in that it not only reaches a wider
audience but that it also takes much less storage and bandwidth.

While Project Gutenberg has been a leader in developing an Internet philosophy
that benefits all the fact is that the "bells and whistles" of the cutest
new Internet things are getting all the money and attention, but they are
not very effective in creating a new generation of people who would be considered
free of ignorance and illiteracy. We need a bit of that money and attention,
and we think of no better possible investment than in placing the great books
of the civilizations of the world into the hands of everyone, for the rest
of history. PLEASE HELP US HELP THE WORLD!

However, all the new "bells and whistles" and repaving the Information
Superhighway in ways that eliminate all but an entirely "new order" of
information providers: commercial in nature, or, perhaps even worse,
non-commercial sites in direct imitation of the commercial sites.

The new proposals for Internet traffic are supposed to put books and other
text on the sidings, while express trains, full of Hollywood imagery, flash
by while the script words just lie there and wait.


I am afraid the situation is much worse that I am willing, it takes more
courage than _I_ have, to describe in detail that I have had to live with
every day for half a year.

Here is part of it:

Problem #1

1. As many of you have heard, the University of Illinois, where Project Gutenberg
was founded in 1971, has decided a continued support of Project Gutenberg
is not in line with a new stiff political policy, to keep out all unauthorized
users, and as part of this policy to eliminate that access Project Gutenberg
has had, authorized but unofficial.

Just part of the new paving process. . .sorry. . .but your access has become
just another roadkill in our efforts for the creation of a mirror-surfaced
Information Superhighway whose mirror will now only reflect authorized
information.

Problem #2

2. What you have not heard is that due to tough financial situations, that
Illinois Benedictine College, [now called Benedictine University] which is
our "official sponsor" is no longer able to provide even the minimal financial
which kept us going through the period when Project Gutenberg in essence
became a full-time job.

Problem #3

3. In addition, our third major means of support, a CDROM made by Walnut
Creek, has had several problems, including, but not limited to, change of
high-level personnel, CDROMs reportedly selling less this year for the first
time, with accounting problems on top of that.

1-2-3. . .just like that, all three of our major supports, cut drastically,
for most of the past year. . .and we have still kept producing Project Gutenberg
Etexts on schedule.

Solution #0

0. The fourth leg of support for Project Gutenberg is, as always, you, the
people. When I started Project Gutenberg, I obeyed that law "Never Quit Your
Day Job for Shareware". . .a law that was not in existence at that time.
. .but as time passed, doubling in output every year took more and more of
my time, I was not able to continue to work as a consultant AND Gutenberg
all at the same time, and Project Gutenberg was too important, is too important,
to let go of. It is VERY hard to stop-- when I think of the fact that if
I can just hold on 1 more year. . .we can multiply our total productivity
by 2.

However, the truth is, that even without my going out from task of actually
getting the books on line to go shmoozing to get support from corporate sources,
even with a request to you for donations in every book we post, the truth
is-- that most of our donations have come from corporations.

A wonderful thing. . .when you think about it. . .but none the less, not
something we can depend on for the future as we never know when these are
going to happen.

If anyone reading this is the sort of person who is happy, even just satisfied,
working with grants, requests, etc, I would welcome your help extremely
gratefully, as I am not, at least never have been, the kind of person who
will stop working on something to get support for that work.

I feel that if the work is really worthwhile and _I_ think Project Gutenberg
is the MOST WORTHWHILE activity I can do . . .then the work itself will create
the needed support-- if not, perhaps I am suffering under delusions.

However, even at that, recent events have conspired to set my mind on getting
Project Gutenberg incorporated, and you are invited to help as much as you
can. These events have shown that it is possible for three independent structures
of seemingly permanent support to all fail simultaneously.

I would very much like to see Project Gutenberg survive to continue after
I am gone, but I realize now that it is not likely that I will be able to
find someone to take over in the same function I have had, which I define
as merely the hub of the wheel, so I have to consider institutionalizing
something that has always been just the raggedy collection of interested
parties, something that could not be without the Internet, and perhaps something
that should never have been able to come into existence at any other time
than it did. . .especially if they continue running over us with a continually
New and Improved Superhighway Steamroller.

So. . .after all that. . .what do we need:

Solution #1

1. We need to get incorporated, hopefully non-profit. This will finally allow
us control over our own finances-- right now the Benedictine University is
in its first years under a new accounting system which has no way to take
any account of something like Project Gutenberg, even though a very expensive
review of the University began with a first line of: "Project Gutenberg is
the only thing you can NOT afford to lose."

Such are the perils of large organizations.

We need to be able to pay our bills in ways that are not a maze of paperwork
so intense that I mostly decide to pay a bill myself rather than do the
paperwork. If Gutenberg is a survivor, I will be repaid. . .if not. . .then
it cannot really matter.

Solution #2

2. We need to gain some kind of financial base. For most of the 25 years
of Project Gutenberg I have paid, usually not terribly large amounts, for
all the expenses-- though in 1989 things really took off and not only did
the expenses go up but I also started spending so much time on the project
that I didn't have much time for much else.

However, two things happened then that allowed me to set a pathway that proved
fairly secure. One was that my father died, and left me just enough money
to either pay off that nasty mortgage on my house, or to invest enough in
Project Gutenberg to keep it running for the foreseeable future.

The other thing was that Illinois Benedictine College, now Benedictine
University, took a great interest in person of their new Vice President,
Bob Preston. However, he is now President of a different college.

Therefore, if you have any abilities at all in the dealing with large
corporations and foundations we would certainly appreciate your help, or
even if you just want to learn to do such things. I, myself, am merely the
kind of person a world would think of as a workaholic with an idea that may
be able to change the world for the better, I am not in an even remotely
true sense any kind of salesman or shmoozer.

I just like doing the work and seeing it do more work.

We have seen a BILLION dollars earmarked for an Electronic Library. . .from
all the major foundations. . .yet when it comes to talking to them about
it. . ._I_ find myself in a drowning in barnyard material when I approach
them. Help!

Solution #3

Anything possible to keep us alive and functioning.

I had planned to leave my house to Project Gutenberg, as I have just barely
managed to finish paying it off, but I am perhaps forced to consider once
again doing the mortgage-- though when I realize how much I could have saved
it I had paid it off back in 1989. . .

If you have any ideas, suggestions, places to try, we hope you will contact
anyone you know on our behalf, you are as much part of Project Gutenberg
as anyone. . . !

I have considered just publishing a list of foundations we think should be
interested in Project Gutenberg and having you write letters directly to
them, in addition to whoever might do any independent contacting.

Conclusion

While it doesn't take much money to keep Project Gutenberg running, probably
only $2,000 per month, you might be very surprised that the over 5,000 newsletter
subscribers might send in an average of only one cent per month each. These
contributions are gratefully accepted, and all are send an email or snailmail
thank you, but they only add up to less than $50 per month. The Benedictines
used to pay for half of our expenses, but they can't afford it any longer.
The several dozen commercial providers who sell access to text files we create,
either online or via disks, don't send us a cent, other than the Walnut Creek
CDROM company, but the situation there is not something we can rely on to
keep us going on more than a day to day basis, as sales are down.

While it is not quite time to PANIC!. . .it is getting all too close. . .and
I certainly would not expect a volunteer army to pop out of the woodwork
on a moment's notice, so I am sending this out a month or two before my
prediction of when it will be time to panic.

I am pretty sure I can last until the holidays, but I will certainly ask
you all to put us on your holiday gift list.

In addition to all of the above, we also plan to keep up a policy of doubling
our production every year, and thus for two books per day during 1997. As
long as we survive, the work should continue to get done on schedule, providing
we double the number of Project Gutenberg Volunteers, too.

It is amazing when I look back on it, but a year ago, from right now, we
were just posting

Etext #350. . .

and now we are posting #700. . . .

If it weren't for the facts that we are in so very serious trouble in our
support structure, we should celebrate in a great fashion that we have once
again managed not only the survival of another year but the creation and
distribution of as many Etexts in the past year as we managed to get on line
in the 24 years before that.

Hopefully next year we will get to celebrate Etext #1,000, in a slightly
less reserved tone.

For now, you can help us in several ways:

1. Get financial donations sent to "Project Gutenberg/BU" at POBox 2782,
Champaign, IL, 61825-2782.

2. Volunteer to help create new Etexts by subscribing for this as follows:

email to listproc@prairienet.org

[no subject required, the only content needs to be]

subscribe gutnberg [firstname lastname]

subscribe gutvol-l [firstname lastname]

If you don't want to volunteer, just subscribe to gutnberg and don't subscribe
to gutvol-l.

Please also send a copy [cc:] to hart@pobox.com, and I can make sure your
subscriptions go through.

If you want make sure you are also on our old listservers, you can also send
the above email to:

listserv@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu

Once again I thank all of the 700 volunteers who have been responsible for
the creation of the 350 new Etext sent out to the world last year, and I
will hopefully be thanking a group of 700 more volunteers over the next year,
as it may still take us an average of two volunteers to create every book
we manage to complete. We would also love to do more books in other languages!!!

Wishing you all the best,

Michael S. Hart
