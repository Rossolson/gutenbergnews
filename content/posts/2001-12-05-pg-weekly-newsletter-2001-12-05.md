Project Gutenberg depends on leverage, the leverage of using the Internet
to multiply the efforts of our few thousand volunteers to get that effort
to a few hundred million people.  Your efforts through Project Gutenberg,
simple as though they may appear. . .typing, scanning, proofreading or an
assortment of other pieces required to get eBooks to the masses. . .are a
powerful beacon to people all over the world.

People ask me how I managed to keep working on Project Gutenberg during a
long initial period of 17 years before anyone ever had any response other
than that it was crazy to put Shakespeare in a computer. . .the answer is
that I could see every word I typed being read by 100,000,000 people.

Your work, on your favorite books, is VERY likely to reach 100,000,000 in
today's world, and even more likely in the world of tomorrow.  Recently I
noted in our Newsletter that the world population has reached 6 billion--
meaning that we only had to reach 1.67% of the population to have reached
our target audience of 100,000,000 people.  When Project Gutenberg began,
the population was around 3.678 billion, which meant we would need to get
our eTexts to 2.72% of the population to reach 100,000,000 people and the
percentange we need to reach to achieve our goal of 100,000,000 people is
continuing to drop, and will be closer to 1% than to 2% before population
is recorded at 6.7 billion, probably before we reach 2009.

Thus, even if your work only reaches 1% of the population, you will still
be able to reach 100,000,000 people. . .Wow!  Talk About Leverage!!!!!!!

So. . .think about this while you are creating eBooks for the world. . .a
little effort on your part, perhaps spread out over days, weeks, or, even
months or years, could easily bring advancements in literacy, information
and the general standard of living to ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE.

That, in a nutshell, is the goal of Project Gutenberg.

For the first time, we have produced 1,000 eBooks in a single year, which
means we have to become even better at supporting you, our volunteers.  I
welcome your suggestions and your efforts as to how to accomplish this.

Wishing You The Very Best Of New Years For 2002!

Michael S. Hart
Founder
Project Gutenberg

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 12/04/01**:  4,161
(This number includes the 27 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

Thru 11/28/01:  48 Weeks & 2 Days (338 days)
                1,103 total new etexts, yr-to-date.
                Weekly avg.:  22.98
                Daily avg:     3.26

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,103 For 338 days,
this is 3.26 per day or 98.04 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1,190 For The Year. . . .
We are about 48 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.

The most recent list we received indicated these were all "life +50"
countries for copyright expiration:

Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize,
Benin, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech
Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Ghana, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan,
(South) Korea, Latvia, Lebanon, Malawi, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Oman, Pakistan, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Qatar, St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia,
and Ukraine.

Works which are in the public domain in Australia and other "Life +50"
countries may remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not
download, or read online, such books if they are in a country where
copyright protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death.
The author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral
rights to oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot
of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary
works of the twentieth century.

EXCITE SEVERS AT&T USERS, CUTS TENTATIVE DEALS WITH CABLES
Excite@Home cut off 850,000 subscribers to AT&T's high-speed Internet
service, casting doubt on AT&T's plan to buy Excite's network assets. The
move came Friday after negotiations for a new service agreement collapsed,
following a bankruptcy court ruling earlier in the day that allowed Excite
to cancel such contracts with the cable operators that used its network.
Meanwhile, negotiations with Cox Communications and Comcast continued, and
service to their customers wasn't disrupted. Both companies have now signed
a non-binding letter of agreement that ensures Excite will continue to
carry their customers until they can migrate them to their own broadband
networks. Cox had announced plans last week to build its own network, but
said it could take some time until all its customers could be moved.
Charter Communications was able to transfer 90% of its Excite customers to
its own network and will resume talks with Excite to establish an interim
contract to service Charter's 14,000 customers in Washington and Oregon,
who have not yet been switched over. AT&T says it has now restored service
to some 225,000 customers by moving them onto its own network, and the
company says it could take as long as 10 days to fully restore service to
its other subscribers. Competitors were quick to seize advantage of the
confusion -- Qwest announced it could migrate AT&T customers to its own
network and give them $300 in free services, and Covad offered a special
promotion to Excite@Home customers to use their dialup services while
waiting for their DSL installation. DirecTV made a similar offer.

EXCITE THREATENS TO CUT OFF BROADBAND SERVICE
More than a third of all U.S. residential broadband users face having their
service cut off at the end of this week unless a dispute between the cable
companies offering the service and Excite@Home, which provides the network,
is resolved. Excite's creditors have asked a California bankruptcy judge to
shut down the service if the cable companies that rely on Excite's network
don't agree to change their contracts with the company. Excite's biggest
customers are AT&T, Comcast and Cox. The creditors have also demanded that
AT&T, which controls Excite, increase its bid for Excite's network assets
from $307 million to more than $1 billion. More than 3 million U.S. homes
with broadband access rely on Excite's service. (Financial Times 28 Nov 2001)

CALIFORNIA SELLS BIRTH DATA TO PRIVATE WEB SITE, 'RAISES RED FLAG'
The State of California has sold the birth data of California residents to
a privately operated genealogy Web site that can now be used to retrieve
such personal data as someone's place of birth or mother's maiden name --
information frequently used as identifying information for purposes of
accessing bank accounts and making various kinds of financial transactions.
State Senator Jackie Spier (D, San Mateo) warns: "The time has come for us
to recognize that identity theft has become a big problem. The fact that
this information is public should raise a red flag." (San Jose Mercury News

GOVERNMENT ALREADY MONITORING MODEMS
Administration officials have revealed that they are making good
use of the new electronic surveillance powers granted them under
the USA Patriot Act recently signed into law. Speaking at a
Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, assistant attorney general
Michael Chertoff said the new powers to obtain information
without court order have allowed the Justice Department to
investigate more thoroughly. He added that the new law also was
helping to bring law enforcement and intelligence investigations
closer together. Cable modem users can now be monitored without
requiring the permission of a judge. Section 211 of the act
alters federal law so that cable operators can disclose
subscribers' personally identifiable information to government
agencies. Chertoff said the government also has the power to
obtain court orders for logging information from out-of-district
ISPs.  (Wired News, 28 November 2001)

WHY COPYRIGHT LAWS HURT CULTURE
Speaking at the Darklight Digital Film Festival in Dublin,
Stanford technology law professor Lawrence Lessig said that
American copyright laws no longer serve artists, acting instead
for the advantage of copyright holders. This control is causing
culture and intellectual history to decline and is stifling
technological innovation, he concluded. People now need
permission to create derivative works of copyrighted material,
shifting the power to build culture into the hands of the
property owners, Lessig said. He believes digital and Internet
technologies have the potential to diversify and open up culture,
giving artists more control over their creations and breaking
the power of monopolistic companies. Already, corporate copyright
"hoarders" are fighting technological breakthroughs such as
peer-to-peer communications programs that bypass copyright
controls, Lessig noted. Furthermore, Lessig declared that the
younger generation of "netizens" is characterized by indifference
and non-involvement in politics, significantly handicapping
efforts to change the system.  (Wired News, 27 November 2001)

WINDOWS XP FAILS TO SPARK DEMAND FOR PCS
Microsoft's Windows XP operating system has not spurred PC sales,
which are currently in the doldrums due to the economic slump and
the war against terrorism. Consumers and businesses are waiting
for the economy to bounce back before they purchase new systems.
NPD Intelect estimates that PC sales experienced a 1 percent
increase in the week following the debut of XP and a 2 percent
increase the following week before falling behind. Analysts are
not expecting holiday sales to be much of an improvement. Gartner
expects the majority of business PCs to be running Windows 2000
next year, while only 16 percent will be running Windows XP.
Nevertheless, PC manufacturers and retailers are planning to
boost sales by offering special deals to shoppers who purchase
systems with Windows XP. (USA Today, 26 November 2001)

RED HAT COUNTERS MICROSOFT'S EDUCATION OFFER
Microsoft has proposed settling over 100 private antitrust
lawsuits by pledging to donate more than $1 billion in hardware,
software, services, and training to the poorest schools in the
United States, but Red Hat has put forward a counter-proposal. It
will offer its open-source Red Hat Linux operating system to all
U.S. school districts free of charge, and has suggested that
Microsoft concentrate solely on purchasing new hardware. In this
way, more computers could be made available to schools and
Microsoft's monopoly would not be extended further into the
education sector, says Red Hat CEO Matt Szulik. He estimates
that over one million computers could be allocated to schools
under the new proposal, compared to 200,000 under the old one. In
addition, Szulik says that Red Hat will provide free software
upgrades and license renewals in perpetuity, whereas Microsoft
would only provide such services for five years.

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

  gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
  gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

        subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

        subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

        unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
