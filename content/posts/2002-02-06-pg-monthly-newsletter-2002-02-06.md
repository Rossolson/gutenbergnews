DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory
B. Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 02/06/02**:  4,492
(This number includes the 40 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

In the first month of the new year, we have produced 200 new etexts!!!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.
Monthly production is based on Etexts announced since the previous
gmonthly newsletter.

With 4,492 eTexts online as of February 6, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.23 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.17 when we had 3150 Etexts A Year Ago

These statistics are calculated based on full weeks of production,
each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting with the first
Wednesday in Jan.  Monthly production is based on etexts announced
since the previous gmonthly newsletter.

Just 7 years ago:
On Feb 1, 1995, Project Gutenberg announced eBook #239.
