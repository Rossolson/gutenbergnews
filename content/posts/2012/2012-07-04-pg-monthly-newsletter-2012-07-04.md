* Birthday of the eBook

Today is July 4.  It is the Independence Day holiday in the United
States, and marks the 41st birthday of electronic books.  On this day
in 1971, in Urbana Illinois, Michael Hart had the opportunity, insight
and inspiration to digitize and share the United States Declaration of
Independence.

You can read this eBook today at www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1

Here are Michael's notes from our eBook #1, from an updated re-release
in 1993:

====================
The United States Declaration of Independence was the first Etext
released by Project Gutenberg, early in 1971.  The title was stored
in an emailed instruction set which required a tape or diskpack be
hand mounted for retrieval.  The diskpack was the size of a large
cake in a cake carrier, cost $1500, and contained 5 megabytes, of
which this file took 1-2%.  Two tape backups were kept plus one on
paper tape.  The 10,000 files we hope to have online by the end of
2001 should take about 1-2% of a comparably priced drive in 2001.

This file was never copyrighted, Sharewared, etc., and is thus for
all to use and copy in any manner they choose.  Please feel free to
make your own edition using this as a base.

In my research for creating this transcription of our first Etext,
I have come across enough discrepancies [even within that official
documentation provided by the United States] to conclude that even
"facsimiles" of the Declaration of Indendence will NOT going to be
all the same as the original, nor of other "facsimiles."  There is
a plethora of variations in capitalization, punctuation, and, even
where names appear on the documents [which names I have left out].

The resulting document has several misspellings removed from those
parchment "facsimiles" I used back in 1971, and which I should not
be able to easily find at this time, including "Brittain."
====================


* Grand opening of self.gutenberg.org

We are very happy to announce a new Project Gutenberg service, the
Project Gutenberg Self Publishing Portal.  The Portal is online
at http://self.gutenberg.org

This site offers some much-desired features for contemporary authors
who want to freely distribute their works.  It is offered as a easier
to use and more suitable venue for such works, with greater
flexibility than www.gutenberg.org.

Visit http://self.gutenberg.org to view the collection, and learn
how to contribute.


* EBook #40000

With little fanfare, Project Gutenberg reached #40000 in its eBook
series recently.  Visit it online at www.gutenberg.org/etext/40000

This eBook includes some beautiful color plates.  It was produced by
Chris Curnow, Keith Edkins and the Online Distributed Proofreading
