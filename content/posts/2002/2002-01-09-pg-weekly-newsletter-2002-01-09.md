The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, January 9, 2002

*Last week ended our 52nd week of production for 2001, now on to 2002*

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
Main URL is promo.net Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
Check out our Websites at promo.net/pg & gutenberg.net. . .for INSTANT
access to this files, please see below, as our Chief Cataloguer is in
the Eastern Hemisphere for the next few weeks, so you will need to find
the new files with the filenames rather than our search engines. . . .

***43 New Listings This Week***

With 4,335 eTexts online as of January 9, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.31 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

This "cost" is down from $3.23 when we had 3100 Etexts on Jan 3, 2001!

Counting our great reduction in *reserved* numbers this means you have
1258 new Project Gutenberg eBooks coming to you over the past 52 weeks.

Please let me know how much information we should include here about a
variety of things about our production schedule.  Should we put all of
these statistics in a separate Newsletter, include them in the weekly
or monthly Newsletters. . .how much should we include?

***

Welcome to another new year at Project Gutenberg!!!

This year I am hoping we will achieve the following goals:

1.  Reach eBook #5000 by our 31st Anniversary on July 4, 2002.

2.  Succeed in republishing several lost collections of eBooks
    from other sites.  Those of you who volunteered for the
    "Raiders of the Lost Art". . .please ask me for details!
    [We also need several volunteer coordinators for these.]
    Even for eBooks of unknown origin, all we have to do is
    proofread the first and last pages of each chapter against
    a clearable paper edition. . .if you are willing to do it,
    then we could literally double our production this year,
    and save large eBook collections from disappearing.

3.  To finally get Project Gutenberg properly funded!
    Let me know if you are willing to write even the simplest
    grant proposals, funding letters, or make any contacts,
    or help us create lists of potential donors, similar to
    the lists used by PBS, etc.

    [If you are already on our Letters Team, you are in here]

4.  To make the Project Gutenberg Newsletter independent!
    Let me know if you are interested in being an editor,
    proofreader, or statistician!!!  Also, let me know if
    you would prefer any change in how we present records
    of our weekly, monthly, yearly or total production.
    We need people who can run spreadsheets or databases!
    Any subscribers to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, etc?

5.  To scan and publish the logs of Captain James Cook,
    who explored and discovered a wide range of places.
    Sam Cook has graciously accepted our request to do
    these and present them to the public, but we need
    some recommendations on planetary scanners, etc.
    This could be a high visibility project.

6.  There is also an outside chance that we will reach #6000
    by this time next year. . .I will keep you posted.

***Requests For Assistance***

Proofers are needed for reading chess board formations using
FEN notations.  The proofers would need to verify that board
positions are indeed in checkmate.  This task will progress
from 3 pieces (two kings and some other piece) on up to the
full complement of chess pieces.  Each file contains the
possible checkmates for the given number of pieces.  While this
task starts small, the total number of board positions will be
staggering, so the more proofers the better!

The Online Distributed Proofreading Team proudly announces another record
high month; in December we completed 18,903 pages!! December also included
our new record high day with 1,195 pages completed on the 5th!!!!!

How high can we go?! Stop on by and give us a hand!

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

&lt;http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;
or
&lt;ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  You can choose a mirror of the
Project Gutenberg collection nearest you.  These sites and indices
are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be done by our professional
Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the world for the next week
or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

***

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 01/09/02**:  4,335
(This number includes the 37 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

In our first week of the new year, we have produced 43 new etexts,
which would yield 2236 for the year 2002 with this as our average.

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday.  Years end
with the first Wednesday in January.  In 2002, January 2nd was the
1st Wednesday, so January 9th is the end of our 1st production week,
and the 52nd week will end January 1, 2003.  Next year will run from
January 2, 2003 to January 7, 2004 and thus will include 53 weeks.

BILL AIMS AT PROTECTING RIGHT TO COPY DIGITAL FILES
Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) says he will introduce legislation that would
amend the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to protect consumers' right to
make copies of digital files, such as songs on a CD. Boucher also has
written a letter to the Recording Industry Association of America,
suggesting that copy-protected CDs may violate the 1992 Audio Home
Recording Act. Under that law, consumers pay a few cents extra each time
they buy a blank CD, with the money going toward the recording industry to
compensate them for potential losses caused by unauthorized copying.
Boucher says, "I am particularly concerned that some of these technologies
may prevent or inhibit consumer home recording." (Los Angeles Times 8 Jan 2002)

MICROSOFT'S PRACTICE OF NOT PAYING DIVIDENDS EARNS NADER'S IRE
Consumer activists Ralph Nader and James Love have written a letter to
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates in which they call Microsoft's "failure to
pay dividends year after year" an "inappropriate and we believe unlawful
device" to shield Microsoft's profits from taxes. Microsoft is currently
sitting on a cash pile of about $36 billion, which has caught the attention
of some analysts and investors who say that it's simply too much, and
should be put to better use, including a possible dividend payout. "It's a
tax-avoidance scheme for the big shareholders," said Nader in an interview.
"This thing is out of control. Has any company in history ever accumulated
so much cash?" Microsoft said in a statement that the U.S. tax code
"recognizes the need for companies to retain cash to fund their businesses,
and high-tech companies commonly maintain significant cash balances to
support their business objectives." (Wall Street Journal 7 Jan 2002)

AOL TO BUY OUT BERTELSMANN STAKE IN AOL EUROPE
AOL Time Warner is paying cash to buy out Bertelsmann's $6.75 billion stake
in AOL Europe in response to Bertelsmann's decision to exercise its option
to sell its stake for the pre-arranged amount. AOL plans to pay in two
tranches -- $5.25 billion in January and $1.5 billion next July. "AOL's
shares have been under pressure and there's quite a bit of volatility in
the stock, so AOL Time Warner looked at its bank facility and decided it
could absorb a cash payment comfortably," said one source close to the
deal. (Reuters/CNet 7 Jan 2002)

INTEL INTRODUCES TWO NEW PENTIUM CHIPS
Intel is introducing two Pentium 4 chips that will run at speeds of 2.0
gigahertz and 2.2 gigahertz, support a more common memory standard (DDR, or
digital data rate), and be designed using the 0.13 micron technology that
allows a greater number of transistors to be placed on each chip. The chips
were previously code-named Northwood. (San Jose Mercury News 7 Jan 2002)

HOME PCs -- THE NEXT HACKER TARGET
Computer hackers are turning their sights to the humble home PC, which is
now faster, more powerful and less secure than ever before. Fueling the
onslaught are several factors, including the trend toward home-based DSL or
cable connections that are "on" all the time, and the lackadaisical
attitudes of most home PC owners who generally don't keep up to date with
the latest antivirus and firewall software. In addition, many home users
are naive about the potential threat and willingly click on unsolicited
e-mails that could be infected with malicious programs. "Home users have
generally been the least prepared to defend against attacks," warns
Carnegie Mellon's Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center. "In
many cases, these machines are then used by intruders to launch attacks
against other organizations." Antivirus firm Message Labs reported that it
detected one virus per 370 e-mail messages in 2001, double the rate of the
previous year. Meanwhile, Amit Yoran of computer security firm Riptech says
the advent of wireless networking will increase the risk of attack
significantly: "The standard itself is insecure."  What we're faced with is
the widespread adoption [of wireless networks] throughout corporate America
and throughout consumer markets and people haven't really thought through
how to protect." (AP/Wall Street Journal 4 Jan 2002)

SEND ME ASCII: A DAY IN THE WIRED LIFE
Sun chief executive Scott McNealy, like the rest of us, gets a lot of
e-mail messages: "I get hundreds a day, I review them all, answer many,
forward many for response, hate the junk, I type really fast, ignore
perfect grammer and typin, getting more over time, but can read e-mail from
any browser, have T1's into my homes and read all that is left from the day
before I go to sleep after the boys go down and get up before they do to
read what came in while sleeping... I HATE attachments, MSFT docs are the
WORST! I send them back. Send me ascii." (USA Today 4 Jan 2002)

APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS ANTI-SPAM LAW
Commercial e-mails, or spam, must contain valid return addresses
and other identifiers that make it easier for consumers to remove
themselves from mailing lists, according to a ruling upheld
recently by a California appeals court. The defendants in that
case, two Palo Alto-based companies, had argued that the previous
ruling violated the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.
Because Congress has yet to settle on any comprehensive anti-spam
law, consumers must rely on state law. But that could result in
a hodgepodge of restrictions on legitimate Web-based businesses.
The California ruling requires that commercial e-mailers also
mark their messages with an "ADV:" in the subject heading, and
a special "ADV:ADLT" for messages linked to adult content. The
Supreme Court in October refused to hear a challenge to a
Washington state law that stringently regulates spam in that state.

["Big Brother Is Watching YOU!"]
JUDGE OKAYS FBI KEYBOARD SNIFFING
U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan ruled that the FBI acted
legally when it installed a keystroke logger in the PC of alleged
mobster Nicodermo S. Scarfo in order to root out a password needed
to decrypt confidential business data. Within the encrypted file
is evidence of a gambling and loansharking operation, according
to the Justice Department. Scarfo's defense contended that this
constituted a violation of both wiretap law and the Fourth
Amendment's outlawed "unreasonable" searches, but Politan's
decision upheld assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Wigler's argument
that neither was circumvented. Wigler said this is the first case
of its kind to employ the keystroke logger, but privacy advocates
are worried that the judge's decision will expand the government's
surveillance powers over its citizens. Also troubling is the fact
that the government did not fully detail the keystroke logger's
operation to the defense, noted Electronic Privacy Information
Center general counsel David Sobel.

HACKERS DISCOVER HOLE IN AOL'S INSTANT MESSENGER
America Online has verified that an international group of
hackers has exploited a buffer-overflow security flaw in its
Instant Messenger program that enables them to commandeer
computers. Only users of the Windows version are threatened,
but there are more than 100 million users of that version.
AOL's Andrew Weinstein said that the company has already
developed a remedy that will be implemented within the next few
days. Utah college student and hacker group founder Matt Conover
advised Instant Messenger users only to accept messages from
those on their "Buddy Lists."

[Harvard Acceptance Letters are Major Spam?]
E-MAIL GLITCH HITS HARVARD APPLICANTS
In the wake of the anthrax scare, Harvard University admissions
officials decided to inform early applicants of their decisions
by e-mail, but a server glitch caused America Online to reject
between 75 and 100 of these instant messages in December.
However, the majority of the applicants eventually received their
notifications. Nevertheless, AOL officials have not been able to
explain why the rejected messages were classified as junk mail
by the servers. AOL's Nicholas Graham said the servers are
designed to block e-mails of a certain size, quantity, or
address. Admissions officials have elected to post a note on
Harvard's Web site suggesting that students ensure that their
ISPs do not block electronic messages from the school.
