Check out our Websites at promo.net/pg & gutenberg.net. . .for INSTANT
access to this files, please see below, as our Chief Cataloguer is in
the Eastern Hemisphere for the next few weeks, so you will need to find
the new files with the filenames rather than our search engines. . . .


With 4,416 Books online as of January 23, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.26 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

This "cost" is down from $3.17 when we had 3166 Etexts on Jan 17, 2001!

100,000,000 readers is about one and a half percent of world population!

We need some volunteers who can do the most basic copyright research,
basically just looking to see if either the publication date or the
copyright date is before 1923.

If you need to follow-up on materials sent in for copyright research,
contact Michael Hart at hart@pobox.com.  Also send him a message if
you recently sent in an etext to be posted, and haven't seen it yet.
You can send a copyright scan to Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;

DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory
B. Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;

For a list of mirrors (copies) of the Project Gutenberg
collection, view http://promo.net/pg/list.html

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
of North America.  For information about how to set one
up, contact Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;

***

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Choose a mirror of the Project
Gutenberg collection near you.

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

&lt;http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;
or
&lt;ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

***

Our production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of production,
each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting with the first Wednesday
in January.  In 2002, January 2nd was the first Wednesday, and January 9th
was the end of the first week of production.


Here are the new & corrected files we have for you this week:

[Thought Police Take Over Portion Of Original 13 Colonies]

VIRGINIA COUNTY RECALLS STUDENT LAPTOPS
Henrico County, Va. school officials are recalling all 11,000 laptop
computers that it distributed to its high school students in order to
retrofit them with security software that will prevent students from using
the devices for accessing pornography or changing their grades -- abuses
that reportedly have occurred since the machines were handed out last fall.
Game and music downloading capabilities will also be eliminated or heavily
restricted and instant messaging will be limited to home use. Teachers have
complained that in-class use of entertainment file-sharing and messaging
are disruptive. (AP/Wall Street Journal 20 Jan 2002)

EXPLODING CHIPS COULD FOIL THIEVES
Researchers at the University of California in San Diego have developed a
way to blow up silicon chips using an electric signal -- an innovation that
could be used to fry electronic circuitry in devices after they're stolen
or fall into the wrong hands. The American spy plane that was impounded in
China last year is an example where such technology would have proven handy
in destroying its secret electronics systems. Similarly, if a cell phone
were stolen, the owner could alert the wireless carrier, which would send a
signal to trigger a small explosion in the phone's chip, rendering it
useless. The techniques uses a small amount of the oxidizing chemical
gadolinium nitrate applied to a porous silicon wafer. (New Scientist
