Project Gutenberg is happy to be a finalist in the Stockholm
Challenge (http://www.challenge.stockholm.se).  On October 7-10, in
the city of Stockholm, Sweden, there will be events and festivities
culminating in an awards ceremony on October 10.

We are seeking someone to attend these events to represent Project
Gutenberg, preferably someone who lives in Europe.

If you are interested in this opportunity to represent Project
Gutenberg, please email hart@pobox.com

***

Requests For Assistance:

Can anyone here find a pre-1923 English edition of the Gilgamesh Epic?

***

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czeck by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

The Distributed Proofreading Team is proud to annouce that they have
now completed over 400 e-texts! Stop on by and give us a hand with
the next 400! http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

A new mailing list "gut-tv@listserv.unc.edu" has been added.
This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free
eBooks This Week" which highlights the free eBooks posted in the
past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help
write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the 35 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,572 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our *FIRST* 1,572 eBooks!!!

              That's 35 WEEKS as Compared to 27 YEARS!!!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,872 eTexts online as of September 4th, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.70 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.61 when we had 3806 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.91 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

At 5872 eBooks in 31 Years We Averaged
