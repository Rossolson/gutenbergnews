DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory
B. Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;


- Information About Mirror Sites

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Choose a mirror of the Project
Gutenberg collection near you.

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

&lt;http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04&gt;
or
&lt;ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04&gt;

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.

Note that updated etexts usually go in the original directory of
their assigned year of publication  (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

***

     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 04/03/02**:  4,901
(This number includes the 58 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 3 months of the new year, we have produced 609 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1996 to produce our *FIRST* 609 eBooks!!!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,901 eTexts online as of April 3, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.04 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.98 when we had 3359 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.94 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 32% less a year later???
