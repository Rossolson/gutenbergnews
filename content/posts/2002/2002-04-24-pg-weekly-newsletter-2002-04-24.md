Request for Assistance:

Project Gutenberg needs help getting its news releases
to the right people.  We'd like to use BusinessWire
(http://www.businesswire.com) but it's very expensive.
Does your organization use BusinessWire?  Might they pay
to distribute Project Gutenberg news releases?  If you have
connections or ideas to help get the word out to national
and international media organizations, please email me.

New Author/Title index: In addition to our search capabilities

Thanks to Geof Pawlicki for writing the program to generate

A Note On Things Celestial

Doug Bowman, one of our board members, and I went out last night
to personally check on the information we provided last week, as
there was some discrepancy in the information he and I received.
It certainly appeared as if Mercury is now visible, about half
way between Venus and where the sun set to the north of Venus.
Mercury should be more and more visible each day for the next
few weeks.  Mars is next, almost on the line from Mecury to
Venus to Saturn to Jupiter, just a little to the right/north
of that line.  As the next few weeks progress, all but Jupiter
will get closer and closer together until they are only a few
degrees apart.

Again my apologies to those who feel this is out of place. . .
It's just one of those rare opportunities. . .
It won't happen again until 2040. . . .   Michael

     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 04/24/02**:  5,110
(This number includes the 66 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 16 weeks of the new year, we have produced 811 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our *FIRST* 811 eBooks!!!

Feb 1997 Dr. Faustus, by Christopher Marlowe, Newer Edition[drfstaxx.xxx] 811

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year for 2001, so the 9th was the end of the first production week.

With 5,110 eTexts online as of April 24, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.96 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.94 when we had 3402 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.98 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan


CHINA BOASTS NO. 2 RANKING IN NET ACCESS
China has the second largest online population of any country in the world,
following the U.S.'s lead, according to a report by Nielsen/NetRatings.
Fifty-six million people, or just over 5% of China's total population, can
access the Internet from their homes, despite the country's comparative
poverty -- more than half the population lives on less than $2 a day. With
Internet subscription rates growing at 5% to 6% per month, more than 250
million people may have access in the next three or four years. "The
potential is staggering, and it's a not-too-distant reality," says the
Nielsen/NetRatings managing director for North Asia. Probably the biggest
obstacle to growth is the dearth of phone lines in that country -- only
35.6% of China's homes currently are equipped with telephone lines.

U.S. BROADBAND GROWTH IS SLOW GOING
About 9% of U.S. households with dialup Internet access say they're highly
likely to switch over to broadband access in the next year, and an
additional 15% are "somewhat interested" in making the change, according to
a survey by Jupiter Media Metrix. Meanwhile, the remaining 76% of
households are either neutral to the idea of paying more for a high-speed
Internet connection or are definitely against it. When asked whether the
switch to broadband was motivated by a desire for viewing high-quality
video content downloaded via the Internet, only 26% responded in the
affirmative. Fifteen percent said they would use their broadband
connections to listen to audio programming. "A lot of these things that
come with a fast connection, they are nice to have, but they are not really
what is driving broadband demand," says a Jupiter analyst. Rather, what
people seemed to value the most about broadband is its "always on"
connection. (Reuters 22 Apr 2002)

AOL RETHINKS BROADBAND STRATEGY
AOL Time Warner is having second thoughts about its cornerstone strategy of
promoting broadband access nationwide, and Co-Chief Operating Officer Robert
Pittman reportedly is urging employees to persuade existing dialup customers
to retain their $23.90-a-month AOL accounts, even after they sign up for
high-speed Internet access from rival cable companies. "A lot of companies
go broke trying to speed up the consumer adoption curve," says Pittman. AOL
had hoped that other cable companies would agree to offer the AOL service
over their lines, but that has not happened so far, and the company's
plunging stock price has caused some investors to suggest that it spin off
the AOL unit. There appears to be little support for that idea among top
executives, however. "The promise of the merger remains intact. We just hit
a speed bump," says AOL Chairman Steve Case. Meanwhile, Jupiter Media Metrix
is predicting that broadband connections will account for about 40% of
online households by 2006, compared with 15% now, and so far this growth is
not helping AOL much. Its customers make up a small fraction of high-speed
clients, while they comprise about half of the traditional dialup market.

Headlines From Edupage

BUSINESSES FIND TIME AND MONEY SAVINGS WITH LINUX
Some large companies are finding Linux a highly attractive alternative
to Microsoft. British Petroleum, Banca Commerciale Italiana, Winnebago,
and Korean Air have moved much of their computer operations over to
Linux, and as many as 15 banks in London are also using Linux.
According to Scott Harrison, director of Linux distributor Red Hat,
many companies are drawn to Linux because software upgrades are not
tied to hardware upgrades, as they often are for new Microsoft
products. Other factors helping Linux include concerns over software
licensing costs from Microsoft and the ability to make very powerful
Linux clusters using old hardware that would not work well with new
Microsoft products. IBM has moved 841 internal servers to Linux,
according to David Valentine, IBM Linux sales and marketing executive,
and will move many more because it offers a "structured low-service
way" to lower costs.   ZDNet, 22 April 2002
http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-887961.html

LINUX FINDS SUPPORT IN LATIN AND SOUTH AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS
A bill currently making its way through the Peruvian legislature would
require government computers to run free, or open-source, software, and
similar moves have taken place in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. Aside
from the financial gains from not having to purchase software, many see
these measures as a refutation of the whole idea of proprietary
software. Open-source applictions like Linux allow developers to modify
code for their own needs. Tony Stanco, a senior policy analyst at
George Washington University's Cyberspace Policy Institute and the
founder of Free Developers.net, told the World Bank in December that
the home-grown industry that open-source requirements could foster
"liberates them, gives them an income source, and allows them to tap
into the world economy like nothing else."

SOFTWARE BUGS THAT AREN'T FLAWS
A new privacy tool presented last week at the 12th Annual Conference of
Computers, Freedom, and Privacy detects Web bugs. Web bugs are very
small image files that are downloaded when users visit Web pages with
the bugs. Bugs then send data about the computer, and sometimes about
the user, back to their creators, often advertisers. One bug was found
to have sent, among other pieces of data, the user's login name and
password, his real first and last names, and the location of his house,
apparently derived from a cookie that was on his computer. Bugnosis,
the new tool to expose Web bugs, alerts users with a sound when it
finds a bug. It then shows where the bug is on the screen, gives the
Web address of the bug, and opens a box that lists the information
being passed. Bugnosis was developed by researchers and support from
Boston University, the University of Denver, and the Privacy Foundation.

COMPUTERS GET SMALLER
OQO Inc., a San Francisco-based start-up, has unveiled a $1,000
Ultra-Personal Computer that fits the components of a CPU into a
package about the size of a paperback book. The 3-by-5-inch box
includes a processor (of up to 1 gigahertz), 256 megabytes of RAM, a 10
gigabyte hard drive, and wireless connections supporting 802.11b and
Bluetooth. The device can connect to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, or
it can be networked with other PCs and laptops. IBM has plans for a
similar product, the MetaPad, though IBM's is not expected for another
few years.    Associated Press, 17 April 2002

IEEE CHANGES AUTHOR REQUIREMENTS ON DMCA
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) said it
will remove language from its author agreement form assuring that the
content is in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA). Bill Hagen of the IEEE said the DMCA has been extremely
controversial, and the language in the author agreement drew many
complaints from authors inside and outside the United States. American
authors feel that the DMCA unconsitutionally stifles research and their
rights to publish results, while authors from outside the Unites States
do not think they should be subject to American laws. CNET, 16 April 2002
