Request for Assistance:

Project Gutenberg needs help getting its news releases
to the right people.  We'd like to use BusinessWire
(http://www.businesswire.com) but it's very expensive.
Does your organization use BusinessWire?  Might they pay
to distribute Project Gutenberg news releases?  If you have
connections or ideas to help get the word out to national
and international media organizations, please email me.

We are still collecting more media email addresses!!!

Please send any we can add to our list!!!

money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee

     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 05/01/02**:  5,152
(This number includes the 70 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 17 weeks of the new year, we have produced 851 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our *FIRST* 851 eBooks!!!

Mar 1997 Democracy and Education, by John Dewey [JDewey #1][dmeduxxx.xxx] 852
Mar 1997 Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson [crmmrxxx.xxx] 851

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year for 2001, so the 9th was the end of the first production week.

With 5,152 eTexts online as of May 1, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.94 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.91 when we had 3441 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.97 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???
