DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.

Note that updated etexts usually go in the original directory of
their assigned year of publication  (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

***

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 03/27/02**:  4,863
(This number includes the 56 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 11 weeks of the new year, we have produced 571 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1996 to produce our *FIRST* 571 eBooks!!!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,816 eTexts online as of March 20, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.06 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.01 when we had 3326 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.95 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 32% less a year later???

The Attorney General's Office Works "Swiftly."

By Mark Wilkinson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An American intelligence officer admitted on
Tuesday to having spied for Cuba for 17 years, bringing to a close
what U.S. prosecutors dubbed a "classic espionage case."
......

"This should send a loud and clear message to anyone committing acts
of espionage in this country that we will deal with them swiftly and
that the price for compromising our country's security will be high,"
Roscoe Howard, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, told
reporters outside the courthouse.

WELCOME TO THE 'THUMB TRIBE'
Young people under the age of 25 who are avid users of handheld
technologies such as mobile phones, GameBoys and PDAs, are exhibiting a
physical mutation, according to research conducted by the Cybernetic
Culture Research Unit at Warwick University in England. The study, carried
out in nine cities around the world, indicates that the thumbs of younger
people have taken over as the hand's strongest and most dexterous digit.
Indeed, in Japan, where the trend is most noticeable, the under-25s refer
to themselves as "oya yubi sedai" -- the thumb generation, or thumb tribe.
The study's author, Dr. Sadie Plant, says: "The fact that our thumbs
operate differently from our fingers is one of the main things that defines
us as humans. Discovering that the generation has taken to using thumbs in
a completely different way and are instinctively using it where the rest of
us use our index fingers is particularly interesting." She cites examples
of younger people using their thumbs exclusively and ambidextrously to type
messages on a phone keypad, barely looking at the keys while doing so.
"They used the absolute minimal movement -- simply exerting pressure with
the thumb rather than tapping at the phone. There are many ways to input
information into these devices, but for some reason kids under 25 most
often choose to use their thumbs over any other digit. There is no question
that choice is having a clear effect on their physicality: thumbs are the
new fingers." (The Observer 24 Mar 2002)

WORTH THINKING ABOUT: THE RISE OF THE VIRTUAL STATE
      UCLA professor Richard Rosecrance says a new kind of nation is
emerging on the world scene:
      "Developing countries, which still produce goods derived from land,
continue to covet territory. But where the products of land no longer
determine market and power relationships, a new form of state is being
born: the virtual nation, a nation based on mobile capital, labor, and
information. The virtual state is a political unit that has downsized its
territorially based production capability and is the logical consequence of
emancipation from land. Virtual states and their associates would rather
plumb the world market than acquire territory.
      "In its pure form -- an ideal model toward which many states are
tending -- the virtual state carries with it the possibility of an entirely
new system of world politics. In the past, when military conflict and the
desire for territory determined relations between nations, the main flow
between countries consisted of armies. Future flows will be largely
economic as capital, technology, manpower, and information move rapidly
among states. In the long term, national access to international factors of
production can replace the need to control additional land."

LINUX PROMOTER VIEWED AS 'SKUNK IN THE ROOM' BY FEARFUL PC MAKERS
The chief technology officer of Red Hat, a company that sells a version of
the Linux operating system, told a federal court hearing the Microsoft
antitrust case that executives of manufacturers such as Compaq, IBM, and
Dell were so fearful of retaliation from Microsoft that they treated him as
though "a skunk had come into the room" when he approached them about
putting Linux software on their PCs. "As the representative of the only
competitor in the domain in which Microsoft remains all powerful, I have
often felt, more than the Maytag repairman, that I have the loneliest job
in town." Although Microsoft licenses a version of its Office software that
runs on the Apple operating systems, a Microsoft spokesman said that his
company sees "no great demand" for Office on Linux, and that the
engineering cost of making a Linux version of Office would not provide a
sufficient return on investment to justify the expense. (Washington Post 25

COMING TO YOUR IN-BOX: "YOU'VE GOT A SUBPOENA"
A federal appellate court has ruled that a Las Vegas casino suing an
unlocatable Internet gambling group can use e-mail to send sufficient
notification of the legal action it is taking. Law professor Ann McGinley of
UNLV says the decision sets a precedent that will "make it easier for
lawyers to find elusive defendants. I think we are moving in the direction
of service by e-mail." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 22 Mar 2002)

GOOGLE PULLS, THEN RESTORES, LINK TO ANTI-SCIENTOLOGY SITE
Caught between the Church of Scientology (which says it was protecting its
own copyrighted material) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (which says
it was protecting free speech), the Google search service first removed,
then replaced, reference to a site critical of Scientology. The Church of
Scientology has accused the site Xenu.net of "wholesale, verbatim copyright
infringement" for posting large quantities of copyrighted material; Xenu and
the Electronic Frontier Foundation have charged that the Church was using
copyright laws to stifle criticism. (Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 21 Mar

HOLLINGS OFFERS BILL TO STOP ILLEGAL MUSIC AND VIDEO SHARING
Senator Ernest Hollings (D., SC) has introduced legislation that would
require computermakers and Hollywood producers to agree on a technical
standard that can be used to prevent computers and other devices from
playing copyrighted digitql files without permission. Media companies (such
as Disney) favor the legislation, which protects their intellectual
property, but computer and equipment companies (such as Intel) oppose it
because it would restrict the functionality of new products. A Hollings aide
says that the legislation respects traditional "fair use" rights for
personal use. (Reuters/USA Today 22 Mar 2002)

A GOOSE AND GANDER STORY: AOL TIME WARNER WORKERS HATE AOL MAIL SYSTEM
When AOL and Time Warner merged, executives of the new company required the
divisions of the old Time Warner to adopt AOL mail system for internal use
throughout the new company. But now that policy has been reversed, because
managers and employees complained bitterly that AOL's consumer-oriented
system is unfit for serious business use, maintaining that the software
crashes, messages can't handle large attachments, communications sent to
large groups of people are mis-identified as spam and thrown away, and so
forth. Staffers in Time's Washington bureau apparently began to mock the AOL
mail system by singing out, "So easy to use, no wonder it's number one." So
employees began relying less on e-mail and more on other forms of
communication. One staffer said, "If all goes well, we'll never have to use
e-mail and we'll start talking to each other again." (Wall Street Journal 22
Mar 2002) http://www.online.wsj.com/ (sub req'd)

MICROSOFT EYES CHINA AS NEXT BATTLEGROUND WITH AOL
Microsoft is considering offering Internet access in China in an expansion
strategy that would pit it directly against AOL, which is already moving
ahead with a $200-million China Internet service joint venture with Legend
Holdings. The move would further escalate the cutthroat competition between
the two companies -- Microsoft is currently conducting an aggressive
campaign to persuade AOL users to switch to MSN, offering a $50 cash
inducement to new subscribers. The software maker is also eyeing Internet
access service partnerships in India and there's been increased speculation
that Microsoft will make a further push into Europe's ISP market soon in an
effort to garner more paying customers. (Reuters 21 Mar 2002)

DIGITAL TECH CORPS ACT WOULD CREATE IT WORKER EXCHANGE
Legislation set for consideration by the U.S. House of Representatives in
early April seeks to create an information technology exchange program
between the federal government and businesses. The Digital Tech Corps Act
would help alleviate a shortage of government tech workers by rotating
private-sector employees with IT-skills into jobs at federal agencies for
temporary assignments lasting up to two years. Government agencies in turn
would lend members of their IT staffs to businesses for similar time
periods. The proposed bill comes as several federal agencies, including the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Interior Department, are
under heavy criticism for having outdated and inadequate computer systems.
A study released last year by the Government Reform Committee found that
more than 40% of major federal IT purchases end in failure. "We need
individuals who can work daily on reviewing the status of IT modernizations
or cross-agency initiatives," says bill co-sponsor Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.).
"Unfortunately, the government cannot attract mid-level IT managers who can
perform these functions." (CNet News.com 20 Mar 2002)

APPLE SPEEDS UP PRODUCTION OF iMACs
Apple chief executive Steve Jobs announced a $100 price increase in iMac
computers and promised to double iMac shipments to 5,000 a day. Third-party
retailers have been complaining that they have been kept waiting on the
delivery of iMacs while some stores owned by Apple are getting a steady
supply, but an Apple marketing manager said: "There's this misperception
that in some way we are hogging all the units. We sold less than 10% of the
iMacs through our Apple retail stores." (San Jose Mercury News 20 Mar 2002)

MIT COMES TO WASHINGTON'S DEFENSE
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has entered into
an alliance with the Pentagon to develop high-tech armor for
soldiers that would incorporate nanotechnology. The United States
government will put $50 million into the Institute for Soldier
Nanotechnology at MIT, while the school will put 35 of its
professors on the project in return. Defense contractors Raytheon
and DuPont are also contributing $40 million over a period of five
years. Some of the applications planned for development include a
fabric with nano-engineered liquid molecules that would stiffen
when subjected to a magnetic field. Soldiers could use their
clothing as a cast if bones are broken, or as protection against
penetration by bullets. Nanotechnology could help to significantly
reduce the weight soldiers currently have to carry, upwards of 125
pounds. The research initially will be unclassified, but that could
quickly change should the Defense Department find any dramatically
valuable military technology.
(Financial Times, 25 March 2002)

HOLLINGS PROPOSES COPYRIGHT DEFENSE
Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, on Thursday introduced the Consumer Broadband and
Digital Television Promotion Act. The law would require that new
technologies, including hardware and software, include features
to prevent the illegal reproduction of copyrighted works, putting
the onus of curtailing copyright problems on the makers of
electronic equipment and applications. Opponents of this and
similar measures contend that they place too much control in the
hands of copyright owners, stripping consumers of traditional
[*legal*] rights of use. (Washington Post, 22 March 2002)

SUN TO BEGIN CHARGING FOR STAROFFICE
Starting this May, Sun Microsystems will begin charging users for
the StarOffice office productivity suite. The software had been
available for free download for the last two years, but users had
indicated that they would be willing to pay for the product if
there were support provided. Sun will continue to offer free
downloads of the OpenOffice.org version of the product, which is
similar to StarOffice. Sun Vice President Mike Rogers said that
by offering the business suite for sale as well as the free
open-source version, the company hopes to serve both ends of the
market.  (Computerworld.com, 19 March 2002)

MERRIAM-WEBSTER WILL OFFER PAID ALTERNATIVE
Adding itself to the growing list of companies that offer premium
content online for a fee, Merriam-Webster introduced a subscription
service to complement its free online service, which remains.
Subscribers have access to the complete, unabridged dictionary,
including more than 470,000 entries, as well as features including
etymology searches, word games, and a monthly newsletter. The free
