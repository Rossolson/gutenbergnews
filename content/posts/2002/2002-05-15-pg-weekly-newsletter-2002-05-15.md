The Marxist Internet Archive (http://www.marxists.org) is in need of
assistance with proofreading. The MIA has many thousands of files
covering 290 authors and 20 languages. The work is all done by
volunteers, and in many cases the standard of proofreading leaves
something to be desired.

The core content of the MIA are the classics of Marxism: Marx, Engels,
Lenin, Trotsky and other members of the Bolshevik Party. The MIA also
holds the most comprehensive English language archive of Hegel, and
significant unique archives of many nineteenth century marxists and
translations of 20th century Russian marxists and an extensive range
of reference material of various kinds.  When copyright permits,
items from the Marxist Internet Archive are contributed to the
Project Gutenberg collection.  Email ablunden@marxists.org.

     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 05/15/02**:  5,220
(This number includes the 71 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 17 weeks of the new year, we have produced 914 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our *FIRST* 914 eBooks!!!

May 1997 The Uncommercial Traveller by Charles Dickens[#23][unctrxxx.xxx] 914

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,220 eTexts online as of May 15, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.92 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.88 when we had 3477 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.96 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

VIDEOGAME CONSOLE MAKERS GIRD FOR PRICE WAR
Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are entering a new phase of the videogame
console wars, following Sony's announcement yesterday that it is cutting
the price of its PlayStation2 machine from $299 to $199, to match the price
of Nintendo's Gamecube. Expectations are high that Microsoft will do the
same for its Xbox next week. In addition to the price cuts, the three
companies are vying for consumers through competing plans to put the
consoles online. Microsoft is taking the biggest gamble, with a
subscription-only broadband network that will allow Xbox owners to play
against one another online using the Xbox's Ethernet adapter. Meanwhile,
Sony and Nintendo are taking a more cautious approach, with plans focusing
on selling online accessories for their consoles and encouraging game
makers to add online features to their titles. "I think people are going to
experiment a lot with the business model and the technology model until we
figure out what works for us and what works for the customer," says Brian
Farrell, CEO of game publisher THQ. "Universally, it's been fairly hard for
businesses to charge consumers for stuff online." (CNet News.com 14 May 2002)

[Cell Phone and Smart Cards Reveal Major Insecurities]

ATTACK OF THE PHONE CLONERS
A team of engineers from IBM and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
have found a way to capture the data necessary to "clone" a cell phone in
60 seconds. Previous methods used to copy the identifying data that enables
calls to be charged to another person's phone took about eight hours. The
researchers found that they could gain valuable information about the
numerical "key" a phone uses to uniquely identify its owner by timing how
long the phone's chip took to complete certain tasks and by measuring
changing current flows across the chip. Taken together, the information
revealed what was being done to the numerical key. The researchers say that
chips can be protected against this type of espionage by making sure all
computational tasks take the same amount of time, or by changing the way a
chip carries out certain computations. (BBC News 14 May 2002)

SMART CARDS REVEAL ALL DURING CAMERA FLASH
A flash of light can cause sensitive information stored on a smart card
microprocessor to  be revealed, say UK researchers at Cambridge University,
who've found that firing light from an ordinary camera flash at parts of a
smart card chip can assist a thief in determining the sensitive information
stored on the card, including the cryptographic key used to secure
financial transactions. The attack is described as "semi-invasive," as only
part of a chip's protective covering must be removed in order to "flash"
it. Meanwhile, another group at Cambridge has developed a microchip design
that would resist this technique, using a more complex "asynchronous"
microprocessor that would not respond in the same way to light
interference. (New Scientist 13 May 2002)

[Deep Linking Takes Yet Another Hit]

REALNAMES GOES BELLY UP, BLAMES MICROSOFT
RealNames, the developer of a keyword navigation system that enables users
to enter a single word into Microsoft's Internet Explorer address line and
be transported to a related Web site, is shutting down. The company blames
its failure on Microsoft's decision not to renew a two-year-old contract
that expires June 30. Microsoft said they had been put off by complaints
that arose when RealNames allowed people acquired rights to words or
phrases that they shouldn't have, and used them to direct unsuspecting Web
surfers to their sites. RealNames founder and CEO Keith Teare said those
problems had been minimized, and contends that Microsoft's decision was
really motivated by a belief that it could better control and generate
revenue from conventional search techniques, or new navigation services
that Microsoft plans to develop. "Because of the widespread availability of
their browser, they are the referee for innovation," says Teare. "If they
say no, the innovation doesn't happen. If they say yes, it does." (Wall
Street Journal 13 May 2002)

MICROSOFT FACES TOUGHER SCRUTINY BY EU
Microsoft may have to make even more radical changes in its software
business to please European regulators than what is being demanded in the
U.S. Following a three-year investigation, European Commission antitrust
officials are considering measures that would force Microsoft to change the
way it produces and sells its Windows operating system and Media Player
software, and to share a significant amount of technical information with
rivals. People familiar with the situation say any decision on possible
fines, which could total up to 10% of Microsoft's turnover, was months
away, but that authorities are also considering asking Microsoft to
separate its Media Player software from its Windows operating system. One
solution being studied by the Commission would be to allow computer
manufacturers to choose between a Windows that included Media Player and
one without it. (Financial Times 10 May 2002)

CALIFORNIA DREAMIN'
Governor Gray Davis of California has decided to return a $25,000 donation
from Oracle given at the same time the state had awarded the company a
lucrative contract. The arrangement recently received considerable
notoriety in the press, and the governor said his decision to return the
money was based on "recent developments." Two weeks ago Davis returned
$10,000 to a California strip club owner after the Los Angeles Times
questioned the donation. (San Jose Mercury News 9 May 2002)

Headlines From Edupage

[Note: I have become aware that even "non-profit public service"
organizations have taken to the commercial practice of forcing a
Web surfer to their home page rather than providing such correct
URLs that would take them directly or indirectly to sites.  In a
story this morning on NPR [National Public Radio], that included
a reference to a particular Web site, instead of giving that URL
NPR gave their own "npr.org" URL. . .a home page which is not an
easy place to find a particular other URL from. . .just so NPR's
hit counter can claim all those extra hits you have to give them
to get to the URL they wouldn't give out directly.  I abhor this
kind of "counterfeit hit scheme" employed by so many, but it may
be even worse to find this sort of thing on NPR and PBS.  mh ]


[For years I have stated publicly that sites go out of their way
to force you to their home page, rather than to let you go where
you want to go on their sites, just to get the extra advertizing
and other exposure, and to count more hits, which they translate
into "the currency of the Web". . .here's some more about this.]

DEEP-LINKING DISPUTES RESURFACE
Two years ago U.S. District Judge Harry Hupp declared that deep
linking, the practice of hyperlinking to a specific page within a Web
site rather than the site's home page, was not a violation of
copyright law. The dispute has come up again, however, in several
recent complaints by site operators. The Danish Newspaper Publishers'
Association has asked that the practice be disallowed, and Belo, the
owner of "The Dallas Morning News," this week sent a stern letter to
BarkingDogs.org demanding the end of deep links to the newspaper's Web
site. If deep links were ultimately declared illegal, this would have
significant implications for many sites, including search engines,
which consistently bypass home pages. A spokesman for Belo said they
feel they should have some control over the use of their content and
that deep links undermine the advertising model for Web sites.

[Are The Anti-Plagiarists Plagiarizing, And Charging For YOUR Works?]

ANTI-PLAGIARISM TOOL MAY INFRINGE ON COPYRIGHT
One of the most popular anti-plagiarism Web sites, Turnitin.com, has
come under scrutiny because of its practice of adding students' works
to its database, sometimes without the students' knowledge. Unlike
other plagiarism-detection Web sites that compare submitted works only
to material on the Internet or to other papers in the class, Turnitin
also adds submitted papers to its database, thereby expanding the reach
of its detection program. However, many students are not told that
their papers will be submitted and added to the database at Turnitin.
This has some worried that students' copyright is being violated and
has led the University of California at Berkeley to decide not to use
Turnitin. Others have opted to use Turnitin but only after informing
students, giving them the option not to have their work sent to Turnitin.
