For those of you interested in things celestial, there is a
rare opportunity to see the ecliptic laid out in plain view,
with all five of the visible planets and the moon moving
through the ecliptic, Mercury being the last one to appear,
probably starting around this Friday, and in increasingly
better view for the following week or ten days, depending
on your weather.  I would suggest starting watching the
sunset now, to get an advance familiarity with the other
four planets and while the moon is still fairly dim.
Best viewing would be west of any city lights, and a bit
to the north.  You'd be amazed at how much better things
look from a vantage point just a 15 minute drive out of
town to the northwest.  Binoculars and telescopes aren't
needed, but bring an added bonus for the Pleiades and the
nebulae in Orion's sword, etc.  I hadn't seen the Little
Dipper in ages, due to light pollution, but it was there.
Mercury, Venus, Mars and Saturn will all be pretty close
to the horizon, with Jupiter further up in the sky.  The
view should continue to improve for about two hours after
sunset.  As the sky darkens, the first things you will
likely see are the moon, Jupiter and then, off to the left
[southwest] will be Sirius, the brightest of the stars.

My apologies to those who feel this is out of place. . .
It's just one of those rare opportunities. . . .  Michael

Thomas Fellner has released version 1.8 of his FREE etext reader at
http://pws.prserv.net/Fellner/Software/eTR.htm. If you haven't tried it,
or haven't updated for a while, why not check it out.

This version is much faster than previous versions and supports a dynamic
Table of Contents(TOC) which is generated from chapter headings. The user
can use the TOC to jump to any chapter. There are many other features,
including scalable fonts, bookmarking and configurable colour scheme.
This has to be the best value in the world!

A recent NY Times article (http://nytimes.com/2002/04/15/arts/15ARTS.html)
highlighted W. Bradford Paley's efforts to visualize an index to eBooks.
His site, http://www.textarc.org, includes visualizations of several Project
Gutenberg eBooks including Alice in Wonderland.  The demos require a
high-speed Internet connection, so aren't for everyone.
Screen images give an idea as to how the tool may be used.

     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 04/17/02**:  5,077
(This number includes the 62 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 15 weeks of the new year, we have produced 785 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1996 to produce our *FIRST* 785 eBooks!!!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 5,077 eTexts online as of April 10, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.97 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.97 when we had 3371 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.96 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

AMAZON AND AUTHORS GUILD ARGUE OVER USED-BOOK SALES
The Authors Guild last week told its members not to provide links to
Amazon.com because Amazon's used-book program takes away from new-book
sales. The Amazon service allows individuals to sell their used books
online, with a percentage of the transaction amount going to Amazon as a
sales commission. But now Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos has urged his
supporters to send a "polite and civil" e-mail note to the Authors Guild,
asking it to change its position. Bezos says, "We've found that our
used-books business does not take away from the sale of new books. In fact,
the opposite has happened." Authors Guild executive director Paul Aiken
says that Bezos has misrepresented the Guild's position: "We don't assert
all used-book sales hurt the industry. We say that Amazon's particular way
of marketing used books is harmful for authors and for publishers." Amazon
uses the same Web pages for both new and used books, often making it
possible for consumers looking for a new book to buy the same book used at
a lower price. (AP/USA Today 15 Apr 2002)

[All studies have also shown that free eBooks also increase sales, but...]


YAHOO AND EXCITE HAVE MESSAGES FOR YOU
Yahoo has changed its privacy policy to make it clear that it has the right
to send mail and make sales calls to tens of millions of its registered
users, and Excite (which has a new owner after being sold in bankruptcy
court last year) has asked its users to accept a privacy policy that
explicitly allows it to rent their names and phone numbers to marketing
companies. Excite's Bill Daugherty says: "It has been our orientation from
the beginning to be straightforward with the user. They are getting free
content and utility that is unparalleled, and in return we will be
marketing products to them." And Yahoo's Srinjia Srinivasan says: "We
believe in the products and services we offer. Our network has grown so
much we want to tell users about them." But privacy advocates are not happy
with these changes. Mark Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center calls these developments unfair: "People thought they were going to
get e-mail solicitations. They didn't expect that their dealings with Yahoo
would cause them to receive phone calls." (New York Times 11 Apr 2002)

FREE CELL PHONES CUT STUDENT DROPOUT RATES
Officials at a New Zealand distance learning project say that giving every
student a free mobile phone has cut dropout rates dramatically. The
graduation rate at the Te Wananga o Aotearoa further education college is
now 91%, according to the school's chief executive -- up from 25% earlier.
The phones are cut off when a student drops out, giving them an incentive
to stick it out. (Ananova 11 Apr 2002)

OQO OFFERS COMPUTER THE SIZE OF A PAPERBACK NOVEL
A San Francisco technology startup company called OQO Inc. has developed a
$1,000 "modular" computer that can operate either as a standalone wireless
handheld device or as a full personal computer, connected to a keyboard,
mouse and monitor. A company executive says: "This is a full Windows XP
computer that fits in your pocket. Desktops are pretty much dead. Most
people would prefer to have a computer they can carry around with them all
the time." The 5x3-inch device contains a Crusoe processor and includes a
10-gigabyte hard drive. (AP/Los Angeles Times 17 Apr 2002)

ONE-FOURTH MELLON FINANCIAL'S I.T. WORK MOVED TO INDIA
The latest financial giant to move much of its information technology work
outside U.S. borders, Mellon Financial will soon be sending a quarter of its
routine software maintenance chores to India. (A study by the Meta Group
consulting firm indicates that an Indian programmer can be hired for
one-fourteenth the rate of an American programmer.) Mellon executive Ken
Herz says the company hopes to have new work for all U.S. workers affected
by the company's decision, and explains: "This project emphasizes our intent
to focus Mellon technology talent on growth-related projects and have
routine maintenance work done offshore." (San Jose Mercury News 16 Apr 2002)

Headlines From Edupage

GATEWAY'S NEW CAMPAIGN ADDRESSES USERS' RIGHTS TO COPY
Gateway, the computer company already known for its ads featuring
CEO Ted Waitt, has begun a new campaign defending, and encouraging,
the legal use of digital media files. The new ads, which end with
the statement that "Gateway supports your right to enjoy digital
music legally," are in part a response to a bill recently introduced
by Senator Hollings that would require copy-protection features on
hardware and software. A spokesman for Gateway said the campaign is
intended to remind users that there are legitimate and legal reasons
to make copies of files and that many digital entertainment files
are in the public domain, not protected by copyright. Hilary Rosen
of the Recording Industry Association of America accused Gateway of
simply trying to sell more CD burners.   Wired News, 11 April 2002
http://www.wired.com/news/mp3/0,1285,51719,00.html

AMAZON'S USED-BOOK SALES UPSET AUTHORS
The Authors Guild sent an e-mail Tuesday to its members encouraging
them to remove links to Amazon.com from their own sites to protest
the company's selling of used books, which pays nothing to writers
or publishers. Amazon began selling used books in November 2000, and
they now constitute 15 percent of Amazon's business. Aside from not
getting any royalties on used books, writers and publishers
complained that used books were being sold on Amazon as soon as the
books were published, fueling a suspicion that review copies were
being sold online. Despite requests that there be a set period of
time between when a book is published and when used copies are
available, Amazon has not changed its practice. Patti Smith, a
spokeswoman for Amazon, said that used books allow readers to try
different genres and authors, at a lower price, and that this
benefits everyone.        New York Times, 10 April 2002
