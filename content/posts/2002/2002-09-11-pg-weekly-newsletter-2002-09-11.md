Project Gutenberg is happy to be a finalist in the Stockholm
Challenge (http://www.challenge.stockholm.se).  On October 7-10, in
the city of Stockholm, Sweden, there will be events and festivities
culminating in an awards ceremony on October 10.

We are seeking someone to attend these events to represent Project
Gutenberg, preferably someone who lives in Europe.

If you are interested in this opportunity to represent Project
Gutenberg, please email hart@pobox.com

***

Requests For Assistance:

Can anyone here find a pre-1923 English edition of the Gilgamesh Epic?

***

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czeck by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

The Distributed Proofreading Team is proud to annouce that they have
now completed over 400 e-texts! Stop on by and give us a hand with
the next 400! http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

A new mailing list "gut-tv@listserv.unc.edu" has been added.
This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free
eBooks This Week" which highlights the free eBooks posted in the
past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help
write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

(This number includes the 91 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the 35 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,615 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,907 eTexts online as of September 11, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.69 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.59 when we had 3806 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.90 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

[Sorry, this came in just as I was finishing up last week's Newsletter]

As part of a wider clamp-down on the ability of Chinese citizens to use the
Internet to learn about the world beyond the country's "Great Firewall,"
Chinese authorities have blocked access to Google. The Google search engine
is especially popular in China because it can run Chinese-language searches.

COMPUTER MOUSE FOR THE BLIND
Scientists at Scotland's Glasgow University have developed a mouse that
vibrates when it passes over a line on a graph, giving the user tactile
feedback that can help make sense of data charts. "The technique is a very
good way of presenting information to blind and sighted people," says
researcher Mike Burton. Comparing the vibrating mouse to electronic
Braille, Burton says one of the most daunting tasks facing visually
impaired people is trying to assimilate information displayed as an
overview of data or events. To reinforce the tactile feedback, Glasgow
scientists also developed sound graphs that use the lines on a graph to
represent sequential tones that vary in pitch based on whether the line is
ascending or descending. "You can get across quite complex information just
using sound," says fellow researcher Stephen Brewster. (Reuters 9 Sep 2002)

BEWARE THE 'PREDATORS OF DIGITAL FREEDOMS'?
Reporters Without Borders, an international media-rights group, has accused
several Western democracies of becoming "predators of digital freedoms" in
their efforts to increase surveillance on the Internet as part of their
fight against terrorism. "A year after the tragic events in New York and
Washington, the Internet can be included on the list of 'collateral
damage,'" said the group in a report. "Cyber-liberty has been undermined
and fundamental digital freedoms have been amputated." The report cites
recent moves to weaken individual privacy laws in the U.S., Britain,
France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Denmark, as well as the European
Parliament, that risk turning ISPs and telecommunications operators in
those countries "into potential branches of the police." The report's
findings mirror those in another report earlier this week issued by the
Electronic Privacy Information Forum and Privacy International, which note
that governments worldwide have made it easier for authorities to eavesdrop
on telephone and online conversations in order to fight terror. (AP 5 Sep 2002)

GUILT-BY-ASSOCIATION?
Law enforcement officials in Wilmington, Delaware are being criticized by
privacy advocates for putting digital photos and other information into a
database of associates of suspected drug dealers rounded up in rough
neighborhoods. A Wilmington public defender calls it "guilt by association"
putting into a database photographs of people whose only crime is being in
the wrong place at the wrong time. It^Rs bad law enforcement, and it's bad
come into our city to take in a ballgame or dine at a restaurant or go to a
theater, you likely won't know about these corner patrols. But if you come
to sell drugs or drink alcohol on the corner or just be a general nuisance,
you're going to see us." (USA Today 4 Sep 2002)

DO ME A FAVOR, OPEN THE DOOR, AND LET 'EM IN, OOH YEAH
So just who is that knocking that door and ringing that bell? In Hamilton
County, Ohio, trouble has flowed from the decision of the clerk of courts
to make all public records freely available on the Web. (They were already
available to anyone who would go to the county courthouse.) The official
is scanned and available. It was very easy to open the door to the public."
And so now anyone can look on the Web to see anyone else^Rs state tax liens,
arrest warrants, bond posting, etc. People are searching the records to
find out the dirt on their neighbors -- or just to get copies of the floor
plans of their houses. Bank executive Jim Moehring says, "You do kind of
feel like Big Brother because you can look right in and get into what
were walking into a hornet^Rs next until after we were under way. "

SENATOR CRITICIZES COPYRIGHT BILL
Sen. George Allen (R-Va.) is pulling his support for the proposed
Anticounterfeiting Amendments of 2002 because of last-minute changes made
to the legislation before it came to a committee vote. The bill originally
targeted large-scale operations that counterfeit "physical features" such
fake Windows holograms or the special packaging used to certify software,
CDs or DVDs as authentic. But the revised version covers "any feature" used
to guarantee authenticity, including technology used in digital rights
management. "Opening this legislation to the digital realm has caused the
virtually unanimous industry support behind it to evaporate, and it has
raised a host of troubling liability issues that cause substantial harm to
Internet service providers," says Allen, who chairs the Senate Republican
High Tech Task Force. Companies now opposing the bill include Verizon,
Microsoft, Apple, eBay and Yahoo, all of whom have voiced their concern
over a section that prohibits "trafficking" in or redistributing files that
contain compromised digital watermarks. They fear the new language opens up
ISPs to prosecution if their subscribers send such files. The revised
version has "divided the community, so to speak, the industry, and went far
afield from the original intent of the bill," says an Allen spokesman. The
version has "divided the community, so to speak, the industry, and went far
afield from the original intent of the bill," says an Allen spokesman. The
bill is set for a full Senate vote, which could come at anytime. (CNet

ATTITUDES ABOUT RESTRICTIONS OF INFORMATION ON THE WEB
An opinion survey conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project
found that two-thirds of Americans think it's appropriate for government
agencies to exclude some information from their Internet postings, and
about half think it's all right for government to monitor Web and e-mail
activities. David Greene of the First Amendment Project in Oakland,
has always prided itself on open access of information is now so scared of
what open access to information means. People think, 'I'm not going to
poison the water system, so what do I need to know about the water supply
system?' But if all of a sudden they are part of an effort to restrict
development of a watershed and need that data ... all of a sudden it's
important." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 5 Sep 2002)

INTEL'S 'LEGRANDE' VISION FOR SECURE CHIPS
Intel is planning to build security features into its microprocessors next
year, in a move aimed at thwarting computer viruses and malicious hackers.
The technology, dubbed LeGrande, initially will be included in Prescott,
the code name for a new Pentium chip due out the second half of 2003. The
idea of using secure chips, in addition to software, isn't new, but gained
wider attention this summer when Microsoft announced its Palladium security
initiative, which it hopes to develop in conjunction with Intel and chip
rival Advanced Micro Devices. Unlike Palladium, however, the LeGrande
technology will work with operating systems other than Microsoft Windows.
The technology works by partitioning off areas of the computer's hard drive

Headlines From Edupage:

VERIZON REFUSES TO DISCLOSE USER'S IDENTITY
Arguing that its customers have a constitutional right to privacy,
Verizon Communications is refusing to reveal the identity of one of its
users to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The RIAA
sent a subpoena to Verizon, saying that it had discovered the Internet
address of a user who was trading in pirated music and wanted Verizon
to reveal that user's identity. The company refused on the grounds
that the request for information was overly broad, based on nothing
more than an allegation of wrongdoing. A spokesperson for Verizon said
the company does not condone piracy, but that as a provider of Internet
connections, Verizon is not responsible for the actions of its users.
The RIAA complains that Verizon refuses to police its users while also
refusing to disclose information that would allow the RIAA or others to do so.

MIGRATING TO A NEW PC SHOULD BE SIMPLE
Ten companies, including IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and Symantec, announced
they have created a new work group focused on reducing the cost and
complexity of migrating to a new PC. Gartner research from 2000
indicated that a streamlined migration plan could save an organization
as much as $124, or 55 percent, per computer. The PC Migration Work
Group will strive to raise awareness of existing products that help
users transfer files and data to new machines, and to develop standards
that will facilitate easier migration. According to the chair of the
work group, migration companies now have a hard time picking apart
applications and data to be transferred. Standards that software
vendors could apply to their code could make the migration process
significantly simpler, with fewer chances for problems.

AOL ADDRESSES SECURITY CONCERNS FOR INSTANT MESSENGER
Despite the potential usefulness of AOL Instant Messenger technology,
many organizations refuse to allow it because of concerns over its
security. Officials from AOL hope that the release of a new version of
the application will answer many of those complaints and will persuade
many organizations to adopt the technology. The release, Enterprise
AIM, gives security personnel control over Instant Messenger, including
who can use it and what the messages can be about, and permits
encryption of messages. Some observers noted that even as an insecure
product, Instant Messenger has a strong user base, suggesting that a
large, untapped demand exists for a secure version.

NEW ATTRACTIONS TO DRAW STUDENTS INTO COLLEGE LIBRARIES
Many college and university librarians have modified long-standing
policies and upgraded facilities in an attempt to lure students into
libraries, away from Internet-connected dorm rooms. After years of
prohibiting food and drinks, the University of North Texas library now
has a Starbucks in a common area. Food and drinks are now allowed in
almost all of the library. The University of Richmond added more
comfortable chairs and computer workstations to its library and saw an
18 percent increase in the number of students visiting the library.
Samuel Demas of Carleton College in Minnesota said his institution has
implemented art exhibits and literary events to draw students into the
library. He said the events recalled a time when the library was the
academic and social center of the campus.
