Project Gutenberg is happy to be a finalist in the Stockholm
Challenge (http://www.challenge.stockholm.se).  On October 7-10, in
the city of Stockholm, Sweden, there will be events and festivities
culminating in an awards ceremony on October 10.

We are seeking someone to attend these events to represent Project
Gutenberg, preferably someone who lives in Europe.

If you are interested in this opportunity to represent Project
Gutenberg, please email hart@pobox.com

***

Requests For Assistance:

Can anyone here find a pre-1923 English edition of the Gilgamesh Epic?

***

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

The Distributed Proofreading Team is proud to annouce that they have
now completed over 400 e-texts! Stop on by and give us a hand with
the next 400! http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg

We currently also have eBooks needing proofing in German and Spanish.

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

***

A new mailing list "gut-tv@listserv.unc.edu" has been added.
This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free
eBooks This Week" which highlights the free eBooks posted in the
past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help
write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

Personal Request:

I am looking for a keyboard for my Visor Edge.

The only one I am SURE will work is the:

PA810U Targus

but there may be others.

I have tried to order many times, nothing ever arrived.

Thanks for any assistance you can provide!

Michael

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download

PGofOz was started in August 2001 by Colin Choat, so it has taken
just over a year to create their first 100 eBooks.  [It took the
first Project Gutenberg about 23 years to reach 100.]

Don Lainson has contributed 30 ebooks to PGofOz as well as many to PG.
He lives in Canada. Sue Asscher of Australia has also been quite involved.

Our HUGE congratulations and thanks to each and every PGofOz volunteer!!!

Henry Handel Richardson (Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson) was born in
1870 in Melbourne, Victoria. She was born in a prosperous family which
later fell on hard times. Her family lived in various towns in Victoria
during her childhood and youth and she attended Presbyterian Ladies
College between the ages of 13 and 17. (This experience was the basis
for her novel The Getting of Wisdom.) She excelled at music during her
time at PLC and her mother took the family (her father having died in
1879) to Europe to enable Ethel to continue her musical studies at Leipzig.

Ethel married J.G. Robertson in 1894 and later moved to London in 1903
where her husband has been appointed to a chair of German at the
University of London. She visited Australia again in 1912 for several
months before returning to England where she lived for the rest of her life.

Ethel Richardson died in 1946.

(This number includes the 100 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

Statistical Review

In the 38 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,718 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our *FIRST* 1,718 eBooks!!!

             That's 38 WEEKS as Compared to 28 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 6,015 eTexts online as of September 25, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.66 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.55 when we had 3896 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.89 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 6015 eBooks in 31 Years We Averaged
    194 Per Year

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

CONGRESS PUSHES TO SWITCH ON DIGITAL TV
Draft legislation proposed by Reps. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and John
Dingell (D-Mich.) would force broadcasters to stop sending analog TV
signals by the end of 2006, rendering most TVs obsolete by 2007. The
Tauzin-Dingall draft, which Congressional staffers hastened to call a
"starting point," sparked a firestorm of protest from broadcasters and
consumer groups. The move is aimed at stepping up the pace of the
switchover from analog to digital TV that was legislated back in 1996.
Under current law, TV stations may continue using airwaves earmarked for
analog signals until 85% of U.S. households in their markets own digital TV
sets, but sales have been extremely slow, hampered by high prices and
limited digital programming. The proposed legislation also requires the FCC
to settle a dispute between the entertainment industry and technology firms
over how best to implement copy-protection technology, known as a broadcast
flag, designed to prevent digital over-the-air TV shows from being copied
and redistributed via the Internet. A hearing is set for next week. (Los
Angeles Times 20 Sep 2002)

WEBCASTERS LOBBY AGAINST ROYALTY ASSESSMENTS
Internet-radio proponents swarmed Capitol Hill Thursday to urge Congress to
delay or lower the royalties they will have to begin paying record labels
beginning Oct. 20. The webcasters have argued that the rates are too high
for a new medium and are planning to appeal the rate of 0.07 cent per song
per listener, which was set last June by the Librarian of Congress. The
music companies are also appealing the rates, which they say are too low.
The two groups are engaged in discussions in an effort to head off dueling
lawsuits, but so far the talks have not produced a settlement. Some
Internet radio firms and broadcasters have already shut down their
webcasting operations, at least in part because of the upcoming royalty
payment. "It was purely an economic decision," says the CEO of
Jefferson-Pilot Corp.'s radio operations, which has stopped streaming 15 of
its 17 stations online because of the fees. (Wall Street Journal 20 Sep 2002)

DOES REAL ESTATE INFO WANT TO BE FREE?
In its convention this fall, the National Association of Realtors (the
country's No. 1 real estate trade association) will be considering a new
rule that will let brokers withhold property information from Internet
sites that give access to multiple listing services. Proponents of the rule
say that such data is valuable information and that it belongs to the
brokers who assemble and manage, while opponents say that brokers should
see themselves as deal managers rather than as information gate-keepers.
NAR general counsel Laurie Janik says that a multiple listing service "is a
broker-to-broker tool. It's never been open to the consumer."

BAN ON CALIFORNIA SPAMMIN'
A new California law that will take effect in January bans the unsolicited
sending of text messages to cell phones. The bill's author, Assemblyman Tim
Leslie (R, Tahoe City), says the bill is intended to stop spam text
messages from getting as out of control as spam e-mail messages. The bill
is part of a package (called "leave-us-alone-legislation), which also bans
unsolicited fax ads and which makes changes to California's "do-not-call"
list for telemarketers. (AP/USA Today 23 Sep 2002)

CALIFORNIA TRIES TO PREEMPT CELL PHONE MARKETERS
California's Governor Gray Davis this week signed into law a measure
that will prevent marketing companies from sending unwanted
advertisements and solicitations to mobile phones and pagers. The bill
was proposed by Assemblyman Tim Leslie. Davis said he supported the
measure because he wanted to prevent an explosion of spam to mobile
devices similar to what has happened with personal computers. The
mobile phone spam bill will go into effect in January. Davis also
signed into law two other privacy bills, one that places stricter
limits on junk faxes and another to facilitate the creation of a
statewide "do not call" list.

TAUZIN PROPOSES DEADLINE FOR DIGITAL TV
Billy Tauzin (R-La.) has proposed requiring television broadcasters to
switch completely to digital signal transmissions by early 2006 and end
analog transmissions by the end of that year. Members of the television
industry, including broadcasters and makers of electronic equipment,
have been slow to agree on a plan to make the transition to digital
signals, and Tauzin thinks it's time for regulators to step in. He
said, "While we prefer marketplace solutions, clearly it's time for us
to provide leadership in this area." Under Tauzin's proposal, the
Federal Communications Commission would establish technical standards
with which broadcasters and equipment makers would have to comply. At
least one consumer group criticized the proposal as too heavy-handed,
stifling innovation and fair use. A spokesman for Tauzin said it was
not clear yet if or when the proposal would be offered as a bill.

NO COMPROMISE ON DVD STANDARD
Two industry groups supporting conflicting standards for rewritable
DVDs have apparently given up on resolving their differences and
settling on a single standard. The DVD+RW Alliance and the DVD Forum
support different formats, and there are at least four types of discs,
causing headaches for consumers and device manufacturers. The result is
an alphabet soup of formats and media that consumers must keep
straight: DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, DVD+R. Observers note that
the market for rewritable DVDs depends largely on resolving the
conflicting standards, making the discs and the formats fully
compatible on PCs as well as home and portable DVD devices. Sony
reportedly will release new drives that work with different formats,
but pressure from companies including Intel may eventually push the two
DVD organizations to find a compromise.

BREAKING THE SPEED OF LIGHT, ON A BUDGET
Researchers at Middle Tennessee State University have created a device
that can send electric signals at four times the speed of light, and
they did so with commonly available components costing $500. This is
not the first time electric signals have exceeded the speed of light,
but it is the first time it's been done without extremely expensive
equipment. The device, which one researcher was able to assemble from
parts in just 40 minutes, can create a pulse of energy that, measured
by an oscilloscope, moves at 4 billion kilometers per hour. Bill
Robertson, one of the researchers, hopes that students and other
researchers can use the device to cheaply test some of the basic
theories of modern science.
