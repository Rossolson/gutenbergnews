to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization

title, author, language and subject.  Choose a mirror of the Project
Gutenberg collection near you.

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

or
&lt;ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;

Note that updated etexts usually go in the original directory of
their assigned year of publication  (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

***

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 02/27/02**:  4,670
(This number includes the 50 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

In the first 8 weeks of the new year, we have produced 378 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1995 to produce our *FIRST* 378 eBooks!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,670 eTexts online as of February 27, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.14 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.12 when we had 3209 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.98 less a year later???

From Edupage

ONLINE GROUP TO GIVE ADVICE REGARDING COPYRIGHTS
The Electronic Frontier Foundation and several law schools
have created a Web site that offers a searchable database of
cease-and-desist information. The site aims to help recipients
of cease-and-desist letters better understand their rights, in
an effort to protect First Amendment freedoms. Wendy Seltzer, a
fellow at Harvard Law School's Berkman Center for Internet and
Society, said, "What we try to do with this site is to clarify
what it is [letter recipients] have to worry about and what's
more likely to just be someone blowing hot air." The goal is to
prevent Web publishers from being intimidated into removing
content from their sites unnecessarily. The site, at
www.chillingeffects.org, is set to go live today and will
encourage others to submit their letters for annotation and
inclusion in the database. Law students at Harvard, the
University of California at Berkeley, and Stanford will analyze
and annotate the letters.
(New York Times, 25 February 2002)

IN LEAN TIMES, E-BOOKS FIND A FRIEND: LIBRARIES
The market for electronic books may not exactly be on fire, but
publishers can take some solace from the fact that e-books are
proving very popular in libraries. Peninsula Library System
executive director Linda Crowe says the growing availability of
electronic resources seems to be bringing in more patrons.
Peninsula, Yale University, and Stanford University have
subscribed to a service from Ebrary that will provide access
to e-books through the institutions' online catalogs.
Approximately 5,000 titles are contained in Ebrary's database,
and the company plans to add thousands more in the coming months
through deals with over 100 publishers. Librarians say the
primary attraction to Ebrary's service is that online access
to e-books is free. However, users are charged fees set by the
publishers to copy or print e-book text. Other e-book
distributors have not fared as well: Companies such as netLibrary
tried to make money by charging libraries for copies of their
e-books and limiting the number of users who could access e-books
at one time. This strategy did not pan out.

[The Thought Police Are At It Again. . .They NEVER Give Up!]

MICROSOFT TRACKS USERS' SONGS, MOVIES
The newest version of Microsoft's MediaPlayer software, which comes free
with the Windows XP operating system, is designed to create a log of the
songs and movies that users play. When a CD or DVD movie is played, the
MediaPlayer 8 software stores that information in a file on the user's PC,
in addition to transmitting an identifier number unique to each user on the
computer. That function creates the possibility that information on user
habits could be tracked and sold for marketing purposes. Privacy experts
say the log file could be used by investigators, lawyers, snooping family
members, or companies interested in finding out an individual's personal
entertainment habits. Microsoft said the program creates the log so that a
user does not have to repeatedly download the same track, CD or movie
information, and that the ID number was created simply to enable
MediaPlayer users to have a personal account on the Web site dealing with
software. The company says it has no plans to share that information with
others. (AP/Miami Herald 21 Feb 2002)

THE MARRIAGE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SECURITY
A number of technology companies are introducing new products that embed
security features inside computer hardware, to add to the protections
offered by software alone. IBM and Targus Systems have developed a new
biometric fingerprint reader that's built into a PC card inserted into the
new IBM ThinkPad laptops, and another example of the trend is the
announcement that VeriSign's "root key" software will be put into the next
version of Phoenix Technology's BIOS (i.e., its basic input-output
software), so that no one but an authorized user can be authenticated on
the computer. (Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 23 Feb 2002)

AOL ACCUSED OF CHARGING FOR UNWANTED GOODS
America Online has been named in a lawsuit for allegedly charging thousands
of customers for merchandise, such as books and stereos, that they did not
order. The suit, which is seeking class-action status, claims that AOL
"unlawfully charged and collected money for this unordered merchandise and
shipping and handling charges from credit card, debit card and checking
accounts." The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages, the refund of
unauthorized payments, and the consumers' retention of the unauthorized
merchandise at AOL's expense. Meanwhile, an AOL spokesman said the
"allegations are without merit and we intend to vigorously contest this
lawsuit in court." (AP 25 Feb 2002)

FIRST-WORLD TECHNOLOGY WASTE ENDS UP IN THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES
A report from five environmental groups claims that hazardous waste from
"recycled" electronics of the U.S. and Europe are being shipped off to such
poorer countries as China, India and Pakistan -- where toxic materials are
often disposed of under unregulated and unsafe conditions. Whereas the
European Union has been urging that a manufacturer should be required to
take "cradle-to-grave" responsibility for its products, the U.S. has
pointed out that much of the electronics manufacturing is no longer done in
the U.S. or Europe. One interesting aspect of the problem: part of the
inability of the U.S. to deal completely with its own electronics waste
disposal requirements is the ironic result of environmental regulations
that forced the closing of many U.S. smelters. (New York Times 25 Feb 2002)
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/25/technology/25TOXI.html


PROPOSED LAWS WOULD DISTRIBUTE ELECTRONICS RECYCLING COSTS
Two bills being considered in the California legislature would pass on to
consumers and businesses the cost of recycling old computers, TVs and other
electronics components. One bill would require consumers to pay a disposal
fee in advance, to be given to governmental or other agencies who handle
recycled electronics; the other would require manufacturers to develop
recycling programs over the next decade. (San Jose Mercury News 21 Feb 2002)
http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/2720414.htm

WEB RADIO SERVICES DEALT BLOW BY ARBITRATION PANEL
A government arbitration panel has recommended that online radio stations
should be required to pay about ten times what the stations themselves had
suggested. Musicmatch chief executive Dennis Mudd says that "over a million
people play our free service every month and it's going to be impossible to
even come close to breaking even with these new rates. Radio on the Web
should be able to serve the same function that radio over terrestrial
airwaves performs, and it's not going to be able to do that because of
these rules." The recommendations just add to the worries of the fledgling
Webcasting industry, which has had trouble getting the attention of
advertisers and is struggling to afford bandwidth costs. But Hilary B.
Rosen of the Recording Industry Association of America is pleased with the
panel's recommendation because "artists and labels, who have supported
these new businesses from the start with their music, are one step closer
to getting paid." However, some critics of the panel's findings believe
that this may the beginning of the end of free radio on the Internet. (New
York Times 21 Feb 2002)

NEW SERVICE DELIVERS PAPER MAIL ELECTRONICALLY
PaperlessPOBox offers a service that delivers 100% of your mail
electronically, whether it starts out that way or not. Customers who sign
up have their snail mail forwarded to an outside P.O. Box address, where it
is picked up by PaperlessPOBox, scanned, and transmitted to users' e-mail
accounts on the same day. The user receives exact replicas of whatever mail
was sent, including hand-written notes and photos. "Personal notes
translate very well," says PaperlessPOBox President David Nale. "We use
state-of-the-art scanners." The service is targeted toward business
travelers who have difficulty keeping up with overflowing mail boxes and
received a boost last fall during the anthrax scare when people were
fearful of contamination via paper mail. (Reuters 20 Feb 2002)
