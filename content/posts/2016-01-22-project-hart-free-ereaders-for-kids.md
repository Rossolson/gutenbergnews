Project Hart is a nonprofit created in the legacy of Michael Hart, founder of Project Gutenberg. Our mission is to make ebooks accessible for everyone. There are so many free ebooks in this world, but many people do not have the computers or internet to access these digital libraries. Project Hart aims to solve this issue by giving ereaders full of ebooks to people in need. We plan to do this through raising funds to buy ereaders and receiving donations of used ereaders.
