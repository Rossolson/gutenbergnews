                           HART'S OPINION [extract]
          (on 'Challenges to Copyright Law Rejected By 9th Circuit')
                               By Michael Hart

Some sad news to report: the 9th Circuit has rejected constitutional
challenges to the copyright laws in *Kahle v. Gonzales*.
https://www.gutenbergnews.org/content/view/153/42/

The opinion is here. Sad, yes, but also positively maddening, for reasons I
will explain shortly.

First, a bit of background: Plaintiffs in this case -- the Internet Archive
and its Chairman, Brewster Kahle, and the Prelinger Film Archive and its
President, Richard Prelinger -- filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that
Congress violated the Constitution when it removed our traditional system of
formalities from the copyright law.

A bit of background:
From the first U.S. copyright statute in 1790 until the Copyright Act of 1976,
the U.S. had an "opt-in" copyright system that limited copyright protection to
those who took affirmative steps to claim it -- by, for example, registering
their copyright, marking copies of their work with copyright notice, and
renewing their copyright after a relatively short initial period of protection.

Our tradition of opt-in copyright stands in stark contrast to what we have
today -- an "opt-out" system that grants copyright protection whether or not
an author desires it. Our current law grants copyright protection whether or
not the work is registered, marked, or renewed.
Formalities, where they have been retained at all, are voluntary and do not
effect the existence or continuation of copyright. Protection is
indiscriminate, and automatic.

NOTES:

At the start of 2007, the PG-US total was adjusted by -350 to take into
consideration the duplications from PG-EU. Please remember that other totals
may also reflect this change.
This figure of -350 is only approximate, we will update once we have received
the exact number of duplications from PG-EU.

We have several counting methods that often differ by several books. There
is also some duplication between the various collections. Volunteers will
need to take these duplications into account.

The PG Australia total does NOT include PG-AU eBooks posted at the U.S.
website; www.gutenberg.org.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire collections to fully
appear in the PrePrints Section, thus the count sometimes jumps by a large
number when the files are eventually completed and added in. Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move later to other
locations, including the main collection or The Project Gutenberg Consortia
Center, etc. For example, on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks
appeared, and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send them to the
PrePrints Section took well over a month.
Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section, it still takes a
certain amount of time to collect and put such a large collection online in a
proper manner.

==============================[ OTHER STATISTICS ]==============================

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS (PG-DP)
9,815 [+42] at Distributed Proofreaders.

The Distributed Proofreaders started production in October 2000 and currently
has over 36,000 volunteers.

NOTE: PG-DP mostly included in U.S. eBooks
NOTE: PG-EU has its own Distributed Proofreaders whose total closely matches
      their grand total.
