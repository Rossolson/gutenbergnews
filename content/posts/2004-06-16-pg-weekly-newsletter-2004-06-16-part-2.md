.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the world,
and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on the search
results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest
to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

EBooks numbered 1 to 10000 are located in "release year" directories.
Over time, the "release year" advanced, so that by November 2003 the
release year was 2006.  Starting with eBook #10001, they are filed by
their official eBook number, with a unique subdirectory based on that
eBook number.

FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000

To get to a directory listing you can use either:

   http://gutenberg.net/1/
     - or -
   ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/

Then navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the
appropriate level, and then select the file you wish to download,
using your usual download procedures.  This system works on mirrors,
too, and will hold all eBooks starting with the number "1" for
10,000 and beyond.


FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000:

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download site
(or a mirror) if you know the filename and year you want.  For example,
navigate to either:

   http://gutenberg.net/etext06/
     - or -
   ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/

and then look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that
updated eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99,
etext00, etc.)

CONVERTING OLD EBOOKS TO THE NEW FILENAMING AND DIRECTORY SYSTEM:

As of 18 May 04, Project Gutenberg volunteers began the process of
manually transferring the eBooks with numbers between 1 and 10000 to
the new directory structure; this means that the files which were
previously posted in etext dirs based on their "official release year"
are now being posted in directories based on their filename.  For example,
eBook #1220, previously posted in the /etext98/ directory, will now be
found in /1/2/2/1220/.  This process will be very slow since it will
include, where possible and practicable, repairing, correcting, and
re-formatting to current PG standards.  The pointers on the PG search
page will be updated as changes are made.

It should be noted that HTML files, particularly those with illustrations,
can now be viewed online directly.

During the past week we processed the following ebooks per the above:

Mike, by P. G. Wodehouse                                                  7423

=============================================================================

David Price sends along the following about #12621, "The Book of Dreams and
Ghosts", by Andrew Lang:

"The chief purpose of this book is, if fortune helps, to entertain people
interested in the kind of narratives here collected."  So wrote Mr. Lang.
It's a collection of well-known and not-so-well-known ghost stories - not
the literary kind but the kind that normal people report.  Andrew Lang isn't
sure what to make of such tales, but he's fairly sure that something is going on
- possibly hallucination, possibly a waking-dream, or possibly - well, he
doesn't really say.  It's a light introduction to the stories, and Andrew Lang's
wry sense of humour often comes through.

(David promises more elucidation on Mr. Lang in the near future.)

. . .

And with the posting of this week's #12623, another version of Daniel Defoe's
"The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1808 Edn.)", Joe Loewenstein
provides the following clarification in his editorial preface:

Daniel Defoe's tale of Robinson Crusoe was first published in 1719.
Numerous, almost countless-versions were published subsequently. Several
are available in Project Gutenberg's library, including the following
e-books: #521, #561, #5902, #6328, #6936, #11239, #11866.

Various tales have been included in the different versions, usually
under the names of "The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe," "The Further
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe," and "Robinson Crusoe's Vision of the
Angelic World." Even an account of the adventures of Alexander Selkirk,
who was marooned for four years on an island in the Pacific Ocean, has
been incorporated into some versions of the Robinson Crusoe stories.
This e-book, taken from an 1808 edition, includes "The Adventures of
Robinson Crusoe" and "The Further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe."

. . .

Menu for today:  gorgonzola cheese sandwiches (mustard optional) and a glass of
burgundy (or a pint).
