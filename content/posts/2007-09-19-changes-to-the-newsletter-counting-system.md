This is only a minor change but should bring the PG count into line with the other gutneberg projects.

I am going to start taking the count for the week NOT including the Wednesday of the Newsletter. So, each day is taken as a whole (Wed = 00:00 to 23:59). This weeks count is taken as follows;

<pre>WED - 2007-09-12 - 13 new ebooks posted</pre>

<pre>THU - 2007-09-13 - 14 new</pre>

<pre>FRI - 2007-09-14 -  9 new</pre>

<pre>SAT - 2007-09-15 - 19 new</pre>

<pre>SUN - 2007-09-16 - 21 new</pre>

<pre>MON - 2007-09-17 -  3 new</pre>

<pre>TUE - 2007-09-18 - 15 new</pre>

WED – 2007-09-19 – This is today's date and the numbers will be counted in next weeks totals.

The only real difference is in helping me to produce the count, as I now don't have to take into consideration the 12noon time that has been previously used.
