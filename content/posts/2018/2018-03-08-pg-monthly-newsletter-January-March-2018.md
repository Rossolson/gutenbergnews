## New Language: Bodo

Project Gutenberg eBooks are offered in 67 different languages and dialects.  Our newest language is Bodo:  
>   <https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/brx>

Bodo (or Mech), is the language spoken primarily by the Bodo people of North East India, Nepal and Bengal.  These two new Project Gutenberg eBooks have a mixture of Bodo and English, and offer insights into Kachári people from publications in the late 19th century.

>   A Collection of Kachári Folk-Tales and Rhymes, by J. D. Anderson  
>   <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506>
>
>   The Kacháris by Sidney Endle  
>   <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50008>


## Shakespeare News

"The Complete Works of William Shakespeare" was the eBook that founder Michael Hart spent much of the 1980s and early 1990s on, releasing it as eBook #100 in 1994.  Michael's father was a Shakepeare scholar at the University of Illinois, and the Project Gutenberg version drew from the knowledge he had.

In early 2018, this eBook was updated with modernized HTML, and plays had tags added to more easily identify the speakers.  Thanks to volunteer Martin, who worked with volunteer David, to implement these updates.

You can find this updated eBook at: <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100>

All works by Shakespeare, in different languages: <http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/65>

Project Gutenberg also has apocryphal Shakespeare works, and books about Shakespeare.


## Web Site Updates

Some readers encountered erroneous blocks of www.gutenberg.org, starting on February 27. As of March 7, most problems are cleared up.

If you encounter problems with the Web site, including being inappropriately blocked from access, please send the diagnostic information from <https://block.pglaf.org> (or <http://block.pglaf.org>). These blocks were caused due to some updates and modernization of the software that Project Gutenberg utilizes to prevent automated mass downloads and other uses that might make the site less available, or less responsive, for our readers.

Thanks, as always, to iBiblio (<https://www.ibiblio.org>) for hosting the main Project Gutenberg site.


## Lawsuit from Germany

Project Gutenberg regrets that www.gutenberg.org is no longer available to any Internet address in the country of Germany.  This is due to a lawsuit which was decided in early February 2018 by the German Court.

The lawsuit concerns 18 eBooks that are in the public domain in the US, where Project Guteberg is based, but are still copyrighted in Germany.  The lawsuit is under appeal, and it is Project Gutenberg's belief that the German Court has no jurisdiction over the offerings or activities of Project Gutenberg, with regards to copyright.

Because the German Court has overstepped its jurisdiction, and allowed the world's largest publishing group to bully Project Gutenberg for these 18 books, there is every reason to think that this will keep happening. There are thousands of eBooks in the Project Gutenberg collection that could be subject to similar over-reaching and illigitimate actions.

PGLAF is a small volunteer organization, with no income (it doesn't sell anything) other than donations. There is every reason to fear that the huge corporation, with the backing of the German Court, will continue to take legal action. In fact, at least one other similar complaint arrived in 2017 about different books in the Project Gutenberg collection, from another company in Germany.

Project Gutenberg's focus is to make as much of the world's literature available as possible, to as many people as possible. But it is, and always has been, entirely US-based, and entirely operating within the copyright laws of the US. Blocking Germany, in an effort to forestall further legal actions, seems the best way to protect the organization and retain focus on its mission.

More information about this situation, including the Court's judgement, may be found at <https://cand.pglaf.org/germany/>

Ideas about how to address the lawsuit are welcome, as are donations to help with legal expenses.  More information is at the link above.
