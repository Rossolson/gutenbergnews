## Web Site Design

First, a reminder from the last newsletter that some readers encountered erroneous automated blocks of [gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org), starting on February 27.  We have continued to fix a few "false positives," where legitimate access is blocked.  If you encounter problems, please visit <https://block.pglaf.org> or <http://block.pglaf.org> and follow the instructions there to send an email report with "diagnostic information."  We apologize to anyone who encountered problems with this new anti-abuse system.

And now, something new: We would like to invite design ideas and input for Project Gutenberg's eBook landing pages, such as <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100>

Discussion is being hosted in the gutvol-d email list, which you can subscribe (or peruse back issues) at <https://lists.pglaf.org>

The idea is to have a static HTML file for every eBook. This will make it easier to get a full copy of the book's files and surrounding meta-data. We are also working on friendlier filenames and other improvements.  The main criterion is to use HTML+CSS only in static files: no Javascript, database, or server-side requirements.  Ideas and demonstrations are welcome!
