## Library of Congress is Crowdsourcing Transcriptions

Spotted online at the United States Library of Congress Web site:

*   <https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-18-134/>
*   <https://crowd.loc.gov/>

These are efforts to get transcriptions of (mostly) hand-written correspondence and other documents.  When Project Gutenberg digitizes items, they are typically printed and therefore we can utilize scanners and optical character recognition (OCR) software to help with transcription.

The Library of Congress effort seems to be focused on hand-written documents, which are generally not well-suited to OCR.  Therefore, volunteers need to first type the correspondence, in addition to proofreading and formatting work.

A characteristic of historical documents that is surprising to many people is the variations among copies.  Project Gutenberg's own document #1 from 1971, the US Declaration of Independence (<https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1>), is an example. There were a number of different hand-written copies of the Declaration, with a number of differences.

Differences included the signatories, as well as some parts of the text. In days before photocopies, carbon paper, or typewriters, it was common for multiple copies to have variations.

The LoC contains many documents with only one copy, of course - including letters, ledgers, and other items. For hand-written works, there are additional challenges in dealing with poor penmanship, smudging, or other deterioration. In addition, variant spelling was much more common than it is today.

Project Gutenberg has a policy of allowing eBook producers to update and regularize spelling, if desired, or to leave original spelling intact. It seems likely that the LoC will want to maintain a highly accurate transcription, for their historical items.
