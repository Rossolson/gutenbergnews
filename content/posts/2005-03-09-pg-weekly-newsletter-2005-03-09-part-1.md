Would anyone like to work on reproofing our Darwin collection

I was just wondering if you or might know someone from PG

the programs compile correctly and so forth.

v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any

REQUEST FOR RUSSIAN TRANSLATOR

We are trying to start up a Project Gutenberg Russian Team,
and we need someone to translate simple email messages from
members of Project Gutenberg who want to provide a service
to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,
we need them translated into English, also in a .doc file.
Thanks!!!     Contact Jared Buck  &lt;JBuck814366460@aol.com&gt;

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.


*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 15,678 eBooks online as of March 09, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.99 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,433,715 x 15,678 x $.99 = $1+ trillion

With 15,678 eBooks online as of March 09, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.64 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.85 when we had 11,819 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 15,678 eBooks in 33 Years and 08.25 Months We Averaged
      ~468 Per Year
        39.0 Per Month
         1.28 Per Day

At 722 eBooks Done In The 63 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      11.5 Per Day
      80 Per Week
     321 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

NewsScan is ceasing publication for at least a while,

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

[India will be following in the steps of China, and then will
come Indonesia, and "suddenly" half the world's population will
no longer be "Third World" or "developing countries."  This is
obvious to anyone paying attention, but we will find that some
very important people, institutions and countries have been
keeping their heads in the sand.]

BRAIN DRAIN CHANGES DIRECTION
Whereas a few years ago the "brain drain" of Indian talent to the West
represented a $2 billion annual loss to India, the recent growth of the tech
industry in India is bringing home as many as 45% of the Indian
high-technology workers abroad. Some engineering schools are already
claiming a 50% decline in the number of students leaving the country, and V.
Kalyanaraman of the prestigious engineering school IIT in Madras says:
"Students are finding interesting and challenging jobs in India. The pay is
also better than it used to be, and they find that they can have a good
quality of life." (USA Today 24 Feb 2005)

[The Legal System Ponders The Online World In Several Ways]

TEXAS BILL WOULD BENEFIT GRADUATES OF ONLINE LAW SCHOOLS
A bill working its way through the Texas legislature could give
graduates of online law schools more opportunities to practice law. The
American Bar Association (ABA) has so far refused to accredit online
law schools, saying that they do not train students adequately to
practice law. Although the ABA continues to refuse accreditation to
online law schools, the organization does accredit institutions that
offer some courses online. Currently in Texas, a graduate of an online
law school can only take the state's bar exam if he or she has
practiced law in another state for at least five years. The proposed
law would allow online graduates to take the Texas bar exam if they
simply had passed the bar in another state. A small number of other
states have similar statutes. California is currently the only state
that allows individuals to take the bar exam without having passed
another state's bar exam. The bill was prompted by the situation of
Julie Drenner, daughter of a state legislator, who graduated from Oak
Brook College of Law and Government in California, passed that state's
bar exam, and now wants to practice law in Texas.

COURT PONDERS PROTECTION OF ONLINE JOURNALISTS
Two court cases involving Apple Computer have significant potential to
define the legal landscape for online journalists. In one case, Apple
has asked the court to allow it to compel the operators of three
industry Web sites to disclose the identities of confidential sources
who supplied the sites with confidential information about upcoming
Apple products. The judge in that case indicated he is leaning toward
finding for Apple. In the other case, Apple has accused Harvard student
Nick DePlume, operator of the Think Secret Web site, of trying to
persuade Apple employees to divulge company secrets. At issue in both
cases is the extent to which online journalists are afforded the
protection granted to traditional journalists for protecting their
sources. An attorney from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is
fighting Apple in the first case, said that a ruling in Apple's favor
would "have a chilling effect on the use of confidential sources."
DePlume's attorney, Terry Gross, commented that had a major newspaper
published the stories that DePlume published on Think Secret, those
actions would simply have been deemed "good journalism" and no lawsuits
would have been filed.

HACKER EXPOSES ADMISSIONS RECORDS

[9 1/2 Hours, Or 9 1/2 Weeks?]

A hacker who was able to access admissions records for dozens of
business schools posted instructions online for how applicants could
access those records. Among the universities whose records were exposed
were Harvard University, Stanford University, Duke University, Carnegie
Mellon University, and Dartmouth College. All of the affected schools
use an online application and notification system called ApplyYourself.
The vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized access has been fixed,
but during the nine hours in which the systems were exposed, several
hundred students attempted to find out if they had been accepted to
schools to which they applied. Final decisions and notifications of
acceptance are not expected for several more weeks. School officials
have been able to identify at least some of the applicants who gained
access to the records systems, and officials from some schools said
such activity would factor into the admission decision. Steve Nelson of
Harvard's MBA program said, "Hacking into a system in this manner is
unethical and also contrary to the behavior we expect of leaders we
aspire to develop." Even if a student saw a decision, said Nelson, that
decision isn't final until March 30.

NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY UNVEILS ONLINE ARCHIVE
The New York Public Library this week unveiled an online archive of
275,000 images, available to the public for free. The project, called
the NYPL Digital Gallery, is supported by a $7 million grant from The
Atlantic Philanthropies and includes Civil War photographs, illuminated
manuscripts, Japanese prints, early American maps, and photographs of
New York City buildings and streetscapes. Paul LeClerc, president and
chief executive officer of the library, noted that while other
libraries are digitizing texts, few are putting materials such as
photographs and maps online. Images in the collection are either in the
public domain or are owned by the library and can be downloaded and
used for noncommercial purposes. The NYPL Digital Gallery project,
which is unrelated to the library's arrangement with Google to
digitize content, is expected to add another 225,000 images to its
database in the coming months.

LIBRARY EXPERIMENTS WITH IPODS FOR AUDIO BOOKS

[The Fact That The iPod Shuffle Actually "Shuffles" The Playing
Order Of The MP3s Might Be A Potential Problem Here, Unless The
Library Puts Only A Single MP3 File On Each iPod]

The South Huntington Public Library on Long Island, New York, has begun
a program of loaning iPod shuffles to library patrons to listen to
audio books. Ken Weil, director of the library, said that the
introduction of Apple's newest iPod device, the shuffle, made the
program economically viable. "It's the right product with the right
price," he said. Although currently the selection of books available in
MP3 format is relatively limited, Joe Latini, assistant director of the
library, said patrons can request new titles to be added. He also noted
that because books in MP3 format cost just $15 to $25, compared to
about $75 for books on CD, the savings will likely pay for the iPod
devices over time. The library has ten of the devices available for
checkout, four of which store 512 megabytes while the other six hold up
to 1 gigabyte.

[More Educational Possibilities for iPods]

IPODS DEBUT AT DREXEL
Students entering the School of Education at Drexel University this
fall will receive iPods as part of a program to explore and evaluate
the educational potential of the devices. Duke University launched a
similar program last fall, distributing iPods to all 1,650 of its
incoming freshmen. The program at Drexel, however, is much smaller in
scope, with about 30 students expected to enter the School of Education
in the fall. Some have criticized such programs as gimmicks that are
unlikely to produce valuable educational results, and officials
involved in the programs acknowledge the risk that students will simply
use the devices to listen to music. Drexel officials said part of the
university's program is to solicit feedback from students about how
the devices could be put to good use educationally. Students will
receive microphones to record interviews and other meetings, and the
university will request that the students use the iPods to create
"audio Web logs" during a required semester of off-campus work. Drexel
will also experiment with podcasting, a process in which iPod owners
can download audio files, such as news announcements or lectures from
professors, and listen to them at their convenience.

RESEARCHERS OFFER PLANET NAMING RIGHTS
Researchers hoping to locate unknown planets outside the solar system
have launched a project to encourage computer users to donate unused
processing power on their computers to analyze telescope data.
Participants in the PlanetQuest Collaboratory whose computers discern
variations in the data that indicate the existence of a planet will be
allowed to name it. The project is led by David Gutelius, visiting
scholar at Stanford University, and Laurance Doyle, an astrophysicist
with the SETI Institute in California. The PlanetQuest project is not
unlike the SETI@Home project, sponsored by the University of California
at Berkeley, which uses donated computing power to search for
extraterrestrial intelligence. Gutelius and Doyle hope to raise enough
money for their project to build as many as 10 telescopes around the
world dedicated to searching for unknown planets. Gutelius said
start-up costs could reach $20 million, with annual operating costs
running about $10 million, money he hopes can be raised from private
investors as well as from subscriptions to premium content and revenue
from ads on the site.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


NBC BLAMES AMERICAN OFFICIALS FOR IRAQ-ASSASSINATION GOOF

NBC News blamed United States officials for a mistakenly reporting
the assassination of the chief judge overseeing the trial of Saddam Hussein.
An NBC spokeswoman said:  "We got the information from multiple high-level
sources who confirmed the story's accuracy," and "It was wrong, and we
corrected it immediately."

Even those who ARE willing to report this story refuse to mention
that NBC showed the judge's picture which was previous banned or
only presented in the now popular digital blur.  In addition,
no these articles are not mentioning his name, which is obviously
still on many sites that originally reported the NBC story.


*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

"A 20 year old worker has a 30% chance of being disabled
before retirement."   U. S. Social Security Information


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Increases oil importation by China and India will drive
price up even further, as they buy all the additional oil
OPEC is putting on the market.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Before the year 2000, only about half the world population
had ever made a phone call.  Now cell phones are reaching
the rural areas of Asia and Africa.

About one billion cell phones have been sold in 18 months.


*

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
