MORE/MOORE ON TERABYTES

According to the Thursday, October 14, 2004, edition of the Wall
Street Journal On-Line, the cost of 1 gigabyte of hard-disk storage
is less than $1 today, down from $560,000 in 1976.  [Actually, I am
reporting that I saw gigabytes for sale for $.44 last Tuesday.]

$440 per Terabyte

Last week I saw 250G drives for $110 at over the counter stores,
so you could buy a terabyte for $440, no rebates required; a few
more dollars for USB boxes to put them in, and it's perhaps $500.

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, eg.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 14 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

if someone would be willing to make one.  I think one is
on the way, but not here yet, in case you are interested.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 41 weeks of this year, we have produced 3249 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3249 eBooks!!!

          That's 41 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With 14,156 eBooks online as of October 20, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.71 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.00 when we had 10,004 eBooks a year ago

Can you imagine ~14,156 books each costing ~$.29 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~14,156 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 14,156 eBooks in 33 Years and 03.50 Months We Averaged
       425 Per Year   [We do about 3/4 that much per month these days!]
        35.4 Per Month
         1.16 Per Day

At 3249 eBooks Done In The 293 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11.1 Per Day
      79.2 Per Week
     342.0 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.


                            *Flashback!!!

                   3219 New eBooks So Far in 2004

               It took us ~31 years for the first 3219 !

       That's the 9.50 months of 2004 as Compared to ~31 years!!!

      Here Is A Sample Of What Books Were Being Done Around #3219

May 2002 Helen of Troy, by Andrew Lang    [Andrew Lang #31][hlntyxxx.xxx] 3229
May 2002 Poems of Progress, by Ella W. Wilcox   [Wilcox #1][pmprgxxx.xxx] 3228

&gt;From NewsScan:


GOOGLE TACKLES DESKTOP SEARCH

[I'd love to hear from anyone trying this out!]

Google has released free Desktop Search software that addresses an
ongoing headache for users -- finding e-mails and files on their own
computers. The move pits Google directly against Microsoft, which includes
a file-search feature in its operating systems and is planning a more
comprehensive tool in the future. Google's Desktop Search
(http://desktop.google.com/) sifts through Microsoft Office and text files,
e-mails, AOL instant messenger exchanges, and Web sites that users have
visited in the past. Once installed, the software creates an index of the
PC owner's files to speed up the search process, and when the owner then
uses Google to search for something, a small box showing related files will
appear above the Web results. "Our goal for the application is to have it
act like a photographic memory for your computer," says Google consumer Web
products director Marissa Mayer. (Wall Street Journal 14 Oct 2004)

GOOGLE'S PC SEARCH TOOL MIGHT PROVE THE 'PERFECT SPY'
Google Desktop Search, released last Thursday in a "beta" test phase,
may prove a boon to disorganized PC users who need assistance in finding
data on their computers, but it also has a downside for those who use
public or workplace computers. Its indexing function may compromise the
privacy of users who share computers for such tasks as processing e-mail,
online shopping, medical research, banking or any activity that requires a
password. "It's clearly a very powerful tool for locating information on
the computer," says one privacy consultant. "On the flip side of things,
it's a perfect spy program." The program, which is currently available only
for Windows PCs, automatically records any e-mail read through Outlook,
Outlook Express or the Internet Explorer browser, and also saves pages
viewed through IE and conversations conducted via AOL Instant Messenger. In
addition, it finds Word, Excel and PowerPoint files stored on the computer.
And unlike the built-in cache of recent Web sites visited that's included
in most browser histories, Google's index is permanent, although individuals
can delete items individually. Acknowledging potential privacy concerns,
a Google executive says managers of shared computers should think twice about
installing the tool before advanced features like password protection
and multi-user support are available. (AP/Washington Post 19 Oct 2004)

DELL TAKES A BITE OUT OF APPLE
Dell launched its diminutive Dell Digital Jukebox music player,
dubbed the DJ 5, which features 5GB of storage for $199. The move signals a
direct challenge to Apple, whose 4GB iPod Mini sells for $249. In addition,
Dell lowered the price on its existing 20GB Dell DJ from $279 to $249 and
introduced a new line of plasma TVs, which start at $2,299. The PC maker's
aggressive move into consumer electronics reflects its determination to
stake out a strong position in the so-called digital home market.

VATICAN TAPS RFID TECHNOLOGY TO TRACK BOOKS
The Vatican Library has tagged about 30,000 of its books with RFID
(radio frequency identification) tags since last year, and says plans call
for tagging 2 million of the 40-million piece collection in the near
future. That would enable the staff to complete the library's annual
inventory in less than a day -- a task that previously forced it to close
for a whole month. Emilia Di Bernardo, VP of Seret, the company that
installed the RFID system, says initially the Vatican staff were interested
only in an efficient inventory process. "But we came up with something that
is not only an inventory but a way to manage the books. This way staff
always know where all the books are." Di Bernardo says it is relatively
inexpensive to maintain the system and the technology does not harm the
books in any way. "The most expensive part is the tags and the hardware."
The RFID tags cost between five and 10 cents each, but Texas Instruments,
which manufactures the tags, anticipates the costs coming down. "It's robust
and as the price comes down, you will see it being used more and more,
including in bus ticketing and concert ticketing," says a TI spokesman.

7-ELEVEN TESTS WIRELESS INVENTORY SYSTEM

Prompted by the example of Wal-Mart, convenience store giant 7-Eleven
is testing a wireless system in 10 Dallas-area stores that enable managers
to scan shelves using a handheld device and instantly order products that
need replenishing. Many retailers already use point-of-sale systems that
deduct sold items from an overall inventory list, but 7-Eleven officials
say the handheld computer takes the process one step further. The device,
made by NEC, features software that helps predict demand for perishable
food -- from sandwiches to milk -- by taking factors such as the weather
forecast into account. Rainy days produce sales slumps, while hot weather
triggers a run on Slurpees. Balancing supply and demand in the margin-thin
world of food stores is critical, according to a 2002 study by Emory
University, which estimated stores lose 4% of potential sales because they
run out of items consumers want. (AP/SiliconValley.com 13 Oct 2004)
&lt;http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/news/editorial/9907516.htm&gt;

[I have personally found out that the stores I go to have more often
been out of what I wanted since the dreaded MBAs [Masters of Business
Administration] have taken over with their "just in time ordering."
The MBAs would apparent prefer to lose that 4%, and the customer-
satisfaction that goes along with it, and thus some friends will NOT
go with me to Wendy's for example, because all too often they are out
of something they want to eat, and there is no time to go elsewhere.
[Why else eat fast food, if you know it might not be there fast?]
I was at Wendy's recently when FIVE CUSTOMERS IN A ROW ordered and
were told they were out of luck. . .they were out of at least five
different things.  And when I asked, they told me that for certain
they would not have all five items after the next truck arrived,
because the MBAs had decided to limit how many items they ordered,
no matter how much would fit on the truck. . . .  GO FIGURE!"]

LAPTOPS PREPARE STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE, BRIDGE INCOME GAPS
Laptop programs are showing up at a number of high schools around the
United States, including T.C. Williams High School in Washington, D.C.,
which this week issued 2,100 laptops to its students. Technology
literacy is one of the primary goals of such programs, as is ensuring
that students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds have equal access
to such technology. John Crites, head of technical support for the
Alexandria school district, said of the $1.4 million program to supply
all students with laptops, "It gives us the ability to level the
playing field." In an effort to control how the computers are used,
administrators of the program at T.C. Williams configured the school's
laptops to allow Internet access only on school grounds, installed
several Web filters, and elected not to allow instant messaging or
e-mail, though a limited e-mail system may be added later.
Washington Post, 13 October 2004
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28050-2004Oct12.html

[Yes, keeping students from emailing each other or their teachers
is obviously a high priority. . .though this seems to be where a
lot of education takes place. . .though it also includes a lot of
yadda yadda yadda.]

of Legal Fees, Damages

California - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
capped its historic victory in a copyright abuse case
against electronic voting machine manufacturer Diebold
today. The corporation agreed to pay $125,000 in damages
and fees. The settlement, a win for free speech advocates,
comes after a California district court found that Diebold
had knowingly misrepresented that online commentators,
including Indymedia and two Swarthmore college students,
had infringed the company's copyrights.

"It makes me happy that students in this situation in the
future won't have to worry about big corporations breathing
down their necks," said Nelson Pavlosky, one of the students.

Diebold is the first company to be held liable for
violating section 512(f) of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA), which makes it unlawful to use DMCA
takedown threats when the copyright holder knows that
infringement has not actually occurred. The section also
stipulates that anyone who issues such frivolous threats
must pay damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, to
those harmed by the misrepresentations.

EFF and the Center for Internet and Society Cyberlaw Clinic
at Stanford Law School sued on behalf of nonprofit Internet
Service Provider (ISP) Online Policy Group (OPG) and the
two students to prevent Diebold's abusive copyright claims
from silencing public debate about voting. Diebold sent
dozens of cease-and-desist letters to ISPs hosting leaked
internal documents revealing flaws in Diebold's e-voting
machines. The company claimed copyright violations and used
the DMCA to demand that the documents be taken down. OPG
refused to remove them in the name of free speech.

"The risk of substantial damages and fees should make
companies pause before sending unfounded copyright
threats," said EFF staff attorney Wendy Seltzer. "Plus ISPs
can fight back against these false claims without taking a
financial hit."

"As a nonprofit ISP it's great to have legal recourse when
a company threatens us or our clients with frivolous lawsuits,"
added OPG Executive Director Will Doherty.

EFF is a member-supported nonprofit which represented OPG
and the Swarthmore students pro bono. Thanks to the
settlement, Diebold will pay the costs of the case.

"Meanwhile, last week was some sort of national holiday in Spain.
In past years there was a US contingent in the military parade,
but it seems that they were left out this year. The French were
invited as substitutes."


"It's Fleet Week here in SF again, and we usually get the Navy's
Blue Angels aerobatics team... this year it was outsourced to the
Canadian Snow Birds ...I can't decide whether it was a deliberate
insult to the Bay Area, or just a sign of astounding lameness..."


"News from your man in Tempe: You already know what happened inside at the
third joint campaign appearance yesterday, and it's a good thing because I
couldn't get anywhere near it. (I just can't call it a blsfrgl ... see, I
can't!) Grady Gammage Auditorium was named for a former ASU president,
designed by famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright, and originally intended to
be built as an opera house in Baghdad. (Yes, the one in Iraq. The project
fell through when King Faisal II was murdered by a military coup in 1958.
It was built here in 1959 without the original parking ziggurat.)

"So here's the news from outside. I was amazed at the size and number of
power transformers on the lawn, probably for lights in the circus tents
erected in the parking lot. Hey, you can't have a media circus without
tents! There was also an eight foot (2.4384 m) chain link fence
surrounding the whole shootin' match about where the perimeter of the
ziggurat would have been.

"Traffic was a mess as slightly over one bazillion motorcycle officers
lined every street within bazooka distance of the president's hotel. When
his handlers told him it was time, those same streets were closed. At
least it was during rush hour, to maximize the disruption."



*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Crude oil is up 62% this year, while heating oil is up 77%.


Various voter registrations in the U.S. are showing more people
have registered to vote than there are people entitled to vote.
Of course, they are all saying that these are only plain errors
and no one is trying to vote more than once.  However, this is
only going to increase, as there are large numbers of brand new
registrations still waiting to be processed, so we can expect a
lot more of these "irregularities and anomalies" to come shortly.


Experts are predicting that the effect of the lack of flu shots
will cause a measurable downturn in productivity in flu season.

[Some are also precdicting a measurable downturn in productivity
in Boston this week due to the fact of having one of the baseball
playoff games run so late that people didn't get to bet until well
after midnight while they have start getting ready to get back in
their seats for the next game only half a day after getting home.]

[Of course these predictions don't always pan out, as when the
big electrical blackouts did NOT result in a higher birth rate
than normal nine months later.]

[More on the flu:  about 40,000 people in the U.S. die of the flu
every year, 144,000 are hospitalized.  3,000,000 die each year
from malaria.  Nothing on worldwide flu deaths that I can find.]
