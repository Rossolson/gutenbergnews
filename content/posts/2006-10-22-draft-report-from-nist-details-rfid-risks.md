  [Of course this is only about risk to management, not to those who might have a medical risk, or who could be located by terrorists via their RFIDs]

  A draft report from the National Institute for Standards and technology (NIST) covers some of the security and privacy risks of using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. Agencies must decide how much information to include on the RFID tags and how to protect it. If the tag is tied to a back-end database, for example, an intruder could use an RFID reader as a back door to the database unless it has been properly secured with access controls, password protection, and cryptography. According to the report, "When practitioners adhere to sound security engineering principles, RFID technology can help a wide range of organizations and individuals realize substantial productivity gains and efficiencies." The report's guidance is intended to help current and future RFID users understand the risks and the best-known safeguards.
