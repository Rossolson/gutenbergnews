For sometime I've been working through the Newsletter Archives doing a manual count on **all** the 'posted' listings, then entering the results into a spreadsheet. I wanted to confirm that all the statistics added up correctly. There was some inconsistencies but I believe that now it is a much more accurate week-by-week, year-by-year account.

As a result there will be some differences in the numbers previously recorded in the newsletters. Therefore I have put together this article to show these new yearly statistics for each year since 2001.

Notes of interest include;

  * 3,042 is the starting figure for 2001 (previously thought to be 3,100)
  * Almost all of the DP-EU books have been posted to the PG site. These duplicates are now subtracted from the totals. Both overall and unique totals will be shown.
  * PG U.S. total includes the PG-EU 'non-unique' figures as these are still a part of that count.
  * REposted total had to be adjusted at the end of 2006 as it was found that a number of reposts were not documented in any newsletter listings.

This is neither a fully accurate nor definitive count, but it certainly brings us another step closer to that goal.

### Summary

#### PG U.S. = 20,537

This includes 354 PG-EU eBooks that are U.S. clearable. No check on PG-AU has been done at this time though it is expected that some will have been duplicated from there also.

#### PG Australia = 1,475

#### PG Europe = 422 [68 Unique]

At present DP-EU is concentrating on eBooks that are clearable in both Europe and the U.S., so these are being posted to both PG and PG-EU. There are currently 354 postings to both with an additional 68 being post to PG-EU only. This figure of 68 was arrived at by checking against the Newsletter archives only and not using the online database at gutenberg.org. I am hoping to do this further check at some point in the future.

#### PG PrePrints = 381

#### GRAND TOTAL = 22,461

This total includes the 68 _unique_ from PG-EU and **not** the total of 422 that PG-EU presently has.
