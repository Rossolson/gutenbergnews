Create Audio Books in MP3 format on your PC using TextAloud MP3.
For more details and to download the free demo, visit
http://nextup.com/redir/pg.html

TextAloud MP3 converts text to speech and to MP3.  As featured in PC
Magazine, The New York Times, and on CNN, TextAloud MP3 is now available
with optional AT&T Natural Voices, the best sounding computer speech ever.
This is great news for Project Gutenberg fans because with the big
improvements in voice quality brought by AT&T Natural Voices, text synthesis
has finally reached the point where computer generated versions of great
literature are listenable and enjoyable.  If you haven't tried Text to
Speech lately, you're in for a surprise.

The basic product is $24.95.  The premium voices add another $15 or more
depending on the options chosen.

We've worked with a few of your proofreaders that were using the program.
We'd be willing to give anyone proofreading for PG a free copy of TextAloud.
Can't give away the premium voices, but if anyone wants a free registration
code for the program, just have them email us at support@nextup.com and tell
us they are proofreading for PG and we'll give them a code.


*** Hot Requests For Assistance

Latin Is A Dying Language???
Latin Library (www.thelatinlibrary.com) died,
and was resurrected recently, bring attention
to the fact that we need to save these files,
find matching paper editions, and be sure the
files don't disappear.

If you would like to help with Latin eBooks,
please let me know.

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to only ONE DVD burner, on a laptop
belonging to a personal friend.  If you have a DVD burner
or plan to get one in the next 6 months, please email me,
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November while
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

We are seeking pro bono or very cheap legal assistance to pursue
Project Gutenberg trademark infringers and similar issues.  Please
email Michael Hart &lt;hart@pobox.com&gt;.

[We received 3 replies from the US, 1 from Australia, but
may need more around December 10.]

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

collection are available around the world.

These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer.


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS

ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 29 weeks of this year, we have produced 2029 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 2029 eBooks!!!

         That's 29 WEEKS as Compared to 29 YEARS!!!


With 8,772 eBooks online as of July 23, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.14 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.58 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.78 when we had 5,611 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 8,700+ books each costing $.64 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 8,700+ books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 8771 eBooks in 32 Years and 00.60 Months We Averaged
    269 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     23 Per Month
    .75 Per Day

At 2028 eBooks Done In The 196 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     10 Per Day
     70 Per Week
    307 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.
This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[Editor's Comments In Brackets]

From Newsscan

U-TEXAS PUTS GUTENBERG BIBLE ON THE WEB
The University of Texas has digitized its entire two-volume Gutenberg Bible
and posted portions of it on its library Web site:
http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenberg/ . While other
copies of the famed Bible have also gone digital, officials at the
university's Harry Ransom Center say their copy is the best of the lot,
because it was in use in monasteries in Southern Germany as late as the
1760s, and was heavily annotated by monks who scratched out some passages
and corrected others. Other sections were highlighted for reading aloud or
for use during Mass. "Our copy is the most interesting in the world," says
head librarian Richard Oram, and Paul Needham, of Princeton University's
Scheide Library, agrees: "This is probably the most extensively annotated
and corrected copy surviving. This is a very great treasure." The
digitization project began in June 2002 and the finished product gives Web
viewers 7,000 images of the unique manuscript. (AP 23 Jul 2003)

["Total Information Awareness" Was Vetoed In the US, Exported To Mexico]

IMPLANTABLE MICROCHIP STRIKES A CHORD IN MEXICO
Palm Beach, Fla.-based Applied Digital Solutions, maker of the implantable
VeriChip, is targeting consumers south of the border, where people see the
tiny devices as a possible new way to thwart crime. The microchips, which
are available in the U.S. as well, are implanted under the skin and can be
used to link to information on identity, blood type and other information
housed on a central computer. In Mexico, citizens hope the tiny devices
could prove one more weapon in the arsenal needed to combat a rising wave
of kidnappings, robberies and other crimes. The Mexican company in charge
of distribution says it hopes to implant 10,000 chips in the first year and
ensure that 70% of all hospitals contain the technology necessary to read
the chips. Company officials say they are working on developing a similar
technology that would use satellites to locate people who've been
kidnapped, an application that is popular with Mexicans, but has raised
privacy concerns in the U.S. (AP 18 Jul 2003)

terrorism and other threats. The charter airline, based in Largo, Fla.,
says it may use face recognition software to match faces to names and
personal records, and plans to store the digital data for up to 10 years.
"From a security standpoint, this provides a great advantage to assure that
there is a safe environment at all times," says Southeast's VP of planning.
The airline says that while such security measures are not required by the
FAA, it expects other airlines will adopt similar systems soon. That
prediction alarms privacy advocates who especially question the need for
retaining the video after the flight is over. "What's the point of keeping
track of everyone when nothing happens on the flight?" asks Lee Tien,
senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who points
out that the video system could record conversations between passengers as
well as capture the titles of passengers' reading material.

MICROSOFT FLAW: A NEW STAGE OF DELIRIUM
Microsoft has acknowledged a critical vulnerability in most versions of its
Windows operating system software, including its latest Windows Server 2003
software. The vulnerability (first pointed out by researchers in Poland
known as the "Last Stage of Delirium Research Group") could be used by
network vandals to seize control of a victim's Windows computer over the
Internet, stealing data, deleting files or eavesdropping on e-mail
messages. The Server 2003 software was sold under the highly promoted
"Trustworthy Computing" initiative launched last year by Microsoft founder
Bill Gates. The company urged customers to immediately apply a free
software patch available from Microsoft's Web site. Internet Security
Systems, an Atlanta-based computer firm, characterized the Windows flaw as
"an enormous threat." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 17 Jul 2003)

YESTERDAY A MICROSOFT FLAW, TODAY A CISCO FLAW
Cisco, which makes communications routers and switches, has found a flaw
in its software that could be used by network vandals to cause widespread
outages; the company has released a free patch to fix the flaw in its
Internetworking Operating System. No vandals have exploited the
vulnerability up to this point, and Cisco says: "We literally have people
working around the clock right now to get this situation taken care of."
According to the company, the vulnerability could only be exploited by
sending a "rare sequence" of data packets to a device running IOS, the
equivalent of Windows for routers and switches. (AP/San Jose Mercury News

WHY ARE SPAMMERS BACKING SPAM-CONTROL LAWS?
Bigtime spam-mongers and junk-mail proponents like the Direct Marketing
Association are backing proposed antispam legislation, while consumer and
public-interest groups, almost without exception, oppose the bills. What's
going on? "It's a sign of who benefits from these bills and who doesn't,"
says a spokesman for the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email.
"When you see some of the biggest spammers in the country backing
legislation that is allegedly antispam, you really need to wonder about
what these bills actually do." The answer is that rather than banning all
unsolicited e-mail outright, as many consumer groups wish, they legitimize
spam, as long as the perpetrators adhere to certain rules, such as using
accurate subject lines and valid return addresses, and allowing recipients
to opt out of future mailings. Two bills are currently making their way
through Congress and a variant of thereof is expected to pass
overwhelmingly and be signed into law later this year.

[I Think He's Shooting Himself In The Foot With Such A Quick Draw McGraw]
[Wouldn't They Sell MORE Of These Magazines At The Stores If They Were On
The Shelves When People Read Them Online And Decided They Wanted A Copy!]

WEBVAN FOUNDER LAUNCHES ONLINE MAGAZINE ARCHIVE
Webvan founder Louis Borders is launching an online newsstand that makes
back issues of 140+ magazines available for browsing and downloading for a
flat fee of $4.95 a month. KeepMedia, as the new venture's called, will
post issues only after they expire on the newsstand in order to avoid
cannibalizing print sales. Borders, who also co-founded Borders Books, says
he believes that online users are finally changing their "information must
be free" attitude: "We feel we're right on the cusp" of a mass audience
willing to pay for digital content, he says. In 2000, media entrepreneur
Steven Brill launched a similar effort called Contentville, which charged
users a couple of dollars to download articles from more than 600
magazines. Brill's operation burned through $6 million to $8 million before
shutting its doors in 2001, but he says the concept is still valid. "The
Internet and electronic delivery is far and away the best way to do it.
Someone will get this right." (Wall Street Journal 21 Jul 2003)

SMILE, YOU'RE ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TV
In Cambridge, England, RFID technology will cause a CCTV camera to take a
photo of anyone taking a package of Gillette Mach3 razorblades from the
shelves of supermarket chain Tesco Ltd.; a second camera then takes a
picture at the checkout and security staff then compare the two images.
"Customers know that there are CCTV cameras in the store," said a spokesman
for Tesco, and says that the purpose of the pilot project is to provide
stock information rather than provide security. However, the manager of the
Cambridge store says he has shown the police photos of a shoplifter. Civil
libertarians says that the so-called "spy chips" are an invasion of
consumers' privacy, but manufacturers point out that the chips can be
disabled simply by having the data erased at checkout when a consumer
leaves the store. (The Guardian (UK) 19 Jul 2003)

WOZNET: APPLE COFOUNDER COMES BLAZING BACK
Beginning with an interest in finding a way to track his lost dogs, Apple
co-founder Steve Wozniak developed location-monitoring technology using
electronic tags and designed to help people keep track of their animals,
children or property. The new company, Wheels of Zeus, is touting WozNet as
a simple and inexpensive wireless network that uses radio signals and
global positioning satellite data to keep track of a cluster of inexpensive
tags within a one- or two-mile radius of each base station. Its low-power
network will complement rather than compete with other wireless
technologies such as radio-frequency I.D. tags used in stores and factories
and higher speed Wi-Fi and cellular data networks. WozNet, with data rates
of no more than 20,000 bps, will be able to transmit a very small amount of
digital information even through environments subject to radio
interference, and will be able to location information from global
positioning system (GPS) satellites. (New York Times 21 Jul 2003)

ADIEU TO 'E-MAIL'?
France's Culture Ministry has announced a ban on the use of the word
"e-mail" in all government ministries, publications or Web sites and is
encouraging French Internet users to adopt the term "courriel" when
referring to electronic mail. Courriel is derived from "courrier
electronique" -- electronic mail -- and, according to the General
Commission on Terminology and Neology, the term is "broadly used in the
press and competes advantageously with the borrowed 'mail' in English."
However, some Internet industry experts disagree with that assessment: "The
word 'courriel' is not at all actively used^E Protecting the language is
normal, but e-mail's so assimilated now that no one thinks of it as
American," says Marie-Christine Levet, president of French ISP Club
Internet, who adds that her company has no plans to switch its terminology.

OUTSOURCING: IT'S 11 PM, DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE SUN IS?
Debashish Sinha of Gartner Inc., a research and consulting firm, calls the
outsourcing of high-tech jobs "a very important, fundamental transition in
the IT service industry that's taking place today," and characterizes it as
a "megatrend in the IT services industry." But Phil Friedman, a software
executive for a U.S. company, fears that once high-tech jobs leave the
country "they will never come back," and predicts: "If we continue losing
these jobs, our schools will stop producing the computer engineers and
programmers we need for the future." But the immediate problem faced by
businesses is how to get the work done and get it done at the best price;
Stephanie Moore, vice president for outsourcing at the Forrester Research
firm, explains: "You can get crackerjack Java programmers in India right
out of college for $5,000 a year versus $60,000 here. The technology is
such, why be in New York City when you can be 9,000 miles away with far
less expense?" On the other hand, many executives insist that the goal is
not to cut costs as much as it is to provide more and better services.
Oracle executive David Samson says: "Our aim here is not cost-driven. It's
to build a 24/7 follow-the-sun model for development and support. When a
software engineer goes to bed at night in the U.S., his or her colleague in
India picks up development when they get into work. They're able to
continually develop products."

AMAZON'S TRIBUTARIES: SOFTWARE, SEARCHING, MUSIC, AND ...
Revenue for Amazon, the Internet's largest retailer, reached $1.1 billion
this quarter (up 36%). Although books and other media account for more than
78% of that revenue, the company is rapidly expanding into areas far beyond
its bookseller origins, with new projects in software, searching, music,
and international markets (where it's 2nd quarter results showed a 81%
year-over-year gain to $397 million). With regard to searching, Amazon has
been developing a search engine that will allow consumers to search the
entire text of books (rather than just the titles or summaries).

[Does Anyone Have The URL For This Search Engine?]

MIT DEVELOPING SEARCH ENGINE FOR GLOBAL POOR
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) argue
that existing Web technologies cater to "Western" users, who are
"cash-rich but time-poor." Users in poor countries, they say, where
phone lines can be hard to come by and many Internet connections are
extremely slow, are in a very different boat: little money but lots of
time. To address this gap, researchers are developing a search engine
that sends requests by e-mail to MIT, where computers perform searches
and return e-mail lists of filtered results the next day. The premise
of the system, according to MIT's Saman Amarasinghe, is that
"developing countries are willing to pay in time for knowledge."
Because those who could benefit from the search engine have only very
slow Internet connections, the software is being distributed on CDs to
users in developing countries.

GROUP AT SYRACUSE TRYING TO SAVE RESEARCH TOOL
Researchers at Syracuse University are working to preserve the popular
research tool AskERIC after the Department of Education decided to stop
funding for the tool. AskERIC is a Web site that provides online access
to educational resources and to experts who can help users sift through
the range of available resources. Syracuse already operates the AskERIC
site, which is run by the Clearinghouse on Information and Technology
of the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC). ERIC now
comprises 16 clearinghouses, though the Department of Education is
working to combine them into a single database. Officials at the
Department of Education said the new structure will make a service such
as AskERIC unnecessary. Many long-time users and operators of AskERIC
disagree, however, and are working to secure funding from Syracuse and
other sources to maintain AskERIC in its current form.

MICROSOFT SETTLEMENT APPROVED
A California judge has accepted the terms of a settlement with
Microsoft under which the software maker will offer vouchers to
individuals and businesses who bought certain Microsoft products
between early 1995 and the end of 2001. Microsoft had been accused of
overcharging for its products. The vouchers range in value from $5 to
$29 and will be good for hardware or software purchases from most
vendors. The maximum value of the settlement is $1.1 billion, though it
could be less depending on how many vouchers are claimed. Two-thirds of
unclaimed money will go to California schools; if all the vouchers are
claimed, however, the schools will get nothing. The claim period, which
will begin in two months, will last 60 days and will feature
advertisements and various other measures to notify potentially
eligible consumers.

[Amazon Has Asked For Our Help With This, What Do YOU Think We Should Do?]

AMAZON TO ADD TEXT-SEARCHING FEATURE
Amazon.com is working on a new program to offer users the ability to
search thousands of nonfiction books. In the Look Inside the Book II
program, users would not be able to view the entirety of any text but
could search for words or phrases across many thousands of texts. The
results would show the sentence where the term appears, and users could
expand that sentence to see several pages before and after the term.
Amazon is currently negotiating with many large publishing houses to
make content available in the program, which Amazon argues will be an
incentive for customers to buy more books. Most of the publishers
Amazon has talked to have reportedly been interested in the program,
though they are concerned about exposing too much of their material.
Users who were able to see just a few pages of reference books and cookbooks,
for example, might see all they need to see and not buy the book.
