============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

2) News

PG on CD

So, you missed the newsletter editor's birthday yesterday. What to buy in a hurry
that's useful and interesting? Well, obviously, as the editor asks for book
tokens every year that's the way to go. Now, what could be better than
a small pile of books to plough through?

Well, how about a HUGE pile?

Yes! you could have the best of Gutenberg at your fingertips all
the time. No dialling in and dropping the line halfway through the download (You
can still do this of course). The Gutenberg CD gives you 558 files for
the princely sum of $19.95 including shipping worldwide! It's not just
books of course, there are movies too.

Whizz along to http://www.simtel.net/spotlights/gutenbergcd.html and
tell Don Watkins we sent you.

Now, of course you can still get everything for free at the usual
address http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg.

Radio Gutenberg update

The runoffs for DJs have been completed and it looks like "The Fishburne
Files" and "Bugsy" are here to stay.
The Fishburne Files will continue to explore the treasures of the Gutenberg
Collection, and to expand Dr. Kula's ability to give satisfying readings of
the broadest possible diversity of material.
In line with that objective, "The Files" is opening the late June - early July
broadcast series with a new reading of Shakespear's "A Midsummer's Night
Dream".  This reading features 22 unique computer voices, continuing
improvement of inflection, a revised Shakespeare Pronounciation guide, and
stereo staging (left-center-right only).

"The Real Dope" will continue to unfold as a live reading, and Bugsy, Radio
Gutenberg's Programming Manager, is working on a means to provide serialized
shows of new books, and a way to snag "re-runs".

3) Notes and Queries

Sci-Fi Time

Brett Fishburne

20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, by Jules Verne

Many have hailed Verne as the first science fiction author.  There is no question that his works often stepped away from the genre of the time, epic adventure, for which they had been written and jumped into the realm of science fiction.  Verne reacts to the evils of monarchic government through the shady character of Captain Nemo who must have had a really good reason for going and building such a boat, right?

Jules Verne was born in 1828 in Nantes, France.  Verne was enamored of the sea and even ran away as a cabin boy while a young man.  His parents, however, thought ill of this and eventually sent him to college to study law.  Verne wasn't much of a lawyer, but he did produce a play while in school which was actually published.  This publication caused his parents to cut off his funding and Verne was forced to live in poverty with only his stories to support himself.  Fortunately, he was such a good author that he more than supported himself, he became quite wealthy and was even able to sail around Europe.  Jules Verne died in 1905.

In this book, Verne tells us the story of a fantastic submarine.  The adventures of the submarine in the deep are the main emphasis of the story and the thrilling ending has captured many a reader.  The underlying story, however, is how a human being reacts to oppression and the loss of his family.  In its original conception, Captain Nemo was driven to build the Nautilus by his family's murder at the hands of the Russian Tsars.  Unfortunately, at the time of publication, France was on good terms with Russia and Nemo ended up being a Hindu Prince who had lost his family in a rebellion aginst Britain.  Nemo's search for freedom comes in the Nautilus and both the adventures and the underlying social commentary therein embodied are excellent reading!

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

 If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

 Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

********

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time or
technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Send email to
dphelp@pgdp.net saying that you are interested in post-processing and we
will help you find a project to work on.
