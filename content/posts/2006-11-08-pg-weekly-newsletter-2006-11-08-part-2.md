-.- HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG -.-

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.org/find

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.org/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

A Pocket Dictionary, Welsh-English, by William Richards                  19704
   [Link: http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/7/0/19704 ]
   [Files: 19704.txt; 19704-h.htm]

   (David Price writes: For those wishing to know:  This is an early Welsh
    to English dictionary by William Richards (1749-1818). It's a pocket
    dictionary and so entries are short.

    For those with no Welsh who want to look up the odd word or two it
    should be useful but you'll need to know that the order of Welsh words
    isn't the same as it would be in English, and some words can change
    their initial letter(s).  I'd suggest using a "find" command in the
    browser/editor. For those with some Welsh, Richards doesn't always get
    the words in the normal Welsh ordering either so you'll need to search
    sometimes.  The spellings are not always the same as in modern Welsh.

    The book as printed (I've two different editions) contains literally
    thousands of mis-prints.  Where possible these have been corrected
    although in some places it wasn't possible to work out what was meant
    (this occurs in both the Welsh and English).

    The book is a product of one man's work and the time in which is was
    written and printed.  It's also a very useful Welsh to English dictionary
    despite the many short-comings.
