.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

=============================================================================

"For those wishing to know", elucidation from David Price:

1.  About #13957, The Pocket George Borrow, by George Borrow:

The Pocket George Borrow is part of a series of "selected passages from
XYZ" produced by publisher Chatto & Windus in the early part of the 20th
century.  A different, but important, person made the selection in each
case.  Other volumes in the same series include Thackeray (chosen by
Alfred Hyatt), Robert Louis Stevenson (already in Gutenberg) and so on.
Edward Thomas, who selected for this volume, is the well-known war-poet:
he was also a great admirer of George Borrow.

George Borrow was an English eccentric, gifted in languages.  All of the
works selected from in this book are available in Gutenberg - if you like
any particular passage you can have the whole eBook as well.


2.  About #13984, In the Wrong Paradise, by Andrew Lang

. . .it's a group of medium-sized stories, mainly on a theme of mythology
(Lang's pet subject).  A number of the stories are written with a wry
twist.  In one of the stories, "The Gladstone Myth" Lang has a friendly
dig at those mythologists whose theories he disagreed with.  The most
well-rounded of the stories is the first one, The End of Phaeacia, in
which a biggotted Victorian "missionary" comes across a "barbaric,
heathen" tribe who, one feels, are more than the missionary perceives...
