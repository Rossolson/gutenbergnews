  Microsoft is set to release a test version of its competitor to Google's controversial book-scanning project. Unlike Google's program, Microsoft's Live Search Books, which goes online December 7, is only scanning out-of-copyright books or those whose copyright owners have given explicit permission. By contrast, Google is scanning in-copyright books, though only books out of copyright will be available on its site. One of the features of the Live Search Books took will allow users to access and search the full texts of books included in the program. When Microsoft's site goes live, it will include texts from the British Library, the University of California, and the University of Toronto. Books from three other institutions will go online in early 2007.<em>BBC, 6 December 2006</em><br /> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6213260.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6213260.stm</a>
