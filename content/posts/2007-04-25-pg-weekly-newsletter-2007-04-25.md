NEW MEDIA GUIDELINE:  THOSE WITH THE GOLD. . .RULE!!!

[This past Sunday: 22-April 2007]

According to NPR it is the megacorp giant Time Warner who is the author of the
current bill in Congress for raising the relative amount small publications
pay to mail out their newspaper and magazines while reducing the relative
amount paid by media giants.

The expected result, more media supersaturation by an ever decreasing number
of media outlets such as radio superconglomerate Clear Channel.

These people have seen what fair competition did to a hugely profitable
monopoly by the Big Three Networks: CBS, NBC and ABC, competition, which, by
the way, had the effect of bringing out the Warner TV Network, but they really
don't want any changes other than in what media markets they don't already
rule. . .so, get out the superlobbyists and write a new law that tilts the
playing field more toward the media giants along with less for the little
guy. . .after all, we want to get America rolling with one voice. . .don't we?

-- Michael Hart

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
