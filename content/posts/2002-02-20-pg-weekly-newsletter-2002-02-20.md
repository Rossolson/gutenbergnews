eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet

1,430   New eBooks Since A Year Ago

   18   New This Week Last Year


Main URL is promo.net/pg Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
Check out our Websites at promo.net/pg & gutenberg.net. . .

I should add that the Internet Public Library, which also includes our
listings, is approaching 20,000, currently at 19,280.  The IPL may try
to post #20,000 on my birthday, March 8, and it appears PG may do 5000
before our planned date of July 4th, our 31st Anniversary, if we go at
this rate much longer. . .looking more like mid-April right now!

IPL is at:  http://www.ipl.org/reading/books/

I should also add that on this date 10 years ago, there were only some
19-20 eBooks available for free download. . .which means that for each
eBook available 10 years ago, there are now 1,000. . . .

That would mean 20 million in just 10 more years, if we keep going!!!

If you find an e-text on the web and need to find a matching pre-1923 edition
to correct it and get copyright approval. . .or if you live near a library
with at a million books and are willing help people find matching editions?
Please email contact Charles Aldarondo (Aldarondo@yahoo.com) and he will try
to connect people lacking a large local collection with whose who have the
means to help from their local collections, and he will explaining the process
of finding/comparing/correcting/submitting such eBooks to Project Gutenberg.

If anyone has the time and inclination to do so, Faust(Part 1)
by Goethe (etext02/faust10.*) could use a good proofreading.

Anyone with a music background who might be interested
in helping out with the Gutenberg Classical Music Project
please contact:  Geof Pawlicki &lt;gpawlicki@earthlink.net&gt;

. . .

Some of our Production Coordinators who do nearly an eBook per day
could use a little help now and then, as we are on the verge of our
first 200 eBook month, and thus they have been somewhat overworked.
If you can help with just one eBook per week or per month, email:
Brett Fishburne &lt;william.fishburne@verizon.net&gt;

We need some volunteers who can do the most basic copyright research,
basically just looking to see if either the publication date or the
copyright date is before 1923.  For legal purposes we should probably
ask for librarians or other professionals for this.

If you need to follow-up on materials sent in for copyright research,
contact Michael Hart at hart@pobox.com.  Also send him a message if
you recently sent in an etext to be posted, and haven't seen it yet.
You can send a copyright scan to Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;
or as a .jpg only to Dianne Bean &lt;pg_research@yahoo.com&gt;.

DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee

For a list of mirrors (copies) of the Project Gutenberg
collection, view http://promo.net/pg/list.html

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
of North America.  For information about how to set one
up, contact Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;

***

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Choose a mirror of the Project
Gutenberg collection near you.

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

&lt;http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;
or
&lt;ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online AS OF Noon 02/20/02**:  4,620
(This number includes the 47 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

In the first seven weeks of the new year, we have produced 328 new etexts.
That's nearly 47 per week, as compared to 18 per week last February.

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,620 eTexts online as of February 20, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.16 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.14 when we had about 3190 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine thousands of books costing $.98 less than a year ago???

COMCAST STOPS STORING INDIVIDUAL WEB-SURFING PATTERNS
In response to criticism from privacy advocates, Comcast has decided to
cease collecting data that would allow it to track the Web surfing habits of
individual subscribers. The company says it had never contemplated using the
information for anything other than to determine aggregate usage patterns so
it could improve the performance of its computers and networks. Comcast
executive Dave Watson says, "We don't want anyone to be concerned we'd take
that next step forward. We just want to take this issue off the table."
David Sobel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center says his group's
concern was not necessarily that Comcast itself would track individual
usage, but that law enforcement agencies might get the information by
subpoena. (New York Times 14 Feb 2002)
http://partners.nytimes.com/2002/02/14/technology/14PRIV.html

[On The Other Hand. . . .]
WASHINGTON POLICE EXPAND USE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY
Noting that people in the United Kingdom have "easily adapted" to pervasive
public surveillance and that "there has not been an outcry about privacy
there," Washington, D.C. police officials are busy expanding the public use
of surveillance cameras. A police department spokesman says, "In the context
of September 11, we have no choice but to accept the greater use of this
technology." MIT emeritus sociology professor Gary T. Marx concedes that
"almost all of the surveillance innovations are easily justifiable" but
worries that "the major concern is: where is it leading?" (Wall Street
Journal 13 Feb 2002) http://online.wsj.com/ (sub req'd)

APPEALS COURT STRIKES DOWN MEDIA CROSS-OWNERSHIP LIMITS
The U.S. Court of Appeals has ordered the Federal Communications Commission
to reconsider its media ownership restrictions, potentially sparking a new
round of media mergers. The long-awaited decision struck down regulations
that prevent companies from owning cable systems and broadcast stations in
the same market, and restrict any TV station owner from controlling more
than 35% of the national TV market. Last year, the same court rescinded FCC
rules barring cable companies from controlling more than 30% of the
nation's total pay-TV market. The changes mean that large cable companies,
such as AOL Time Warner, would be allowed to acquire broadcast networks
such as NBC -- a move AOL Chairman Steve Case has said he would consider.
The change will also make it easier for networks to expand their strategy
of acquiring as many of their highly profitable local affiliates as
possible. Paxson Communications Chairman Bud Paxson predicted the
elimination of the 35% cap will lead to "massive consolidation" as "smaller
stations sell out." In immediate terms, the ruling relieves Fox Television
and Viacom from having to unload excess TV stations they acquired from
Chris-Craft and CBS, respectively. Both companies had received temporary
waivers pending Tuesday's ruling. (Wall Street Journal 20 Feb 2002)

COURT TO REVIEW COPYRIGHT EXTENSION LAW
The U.S. Supreme Court announced it will review a challenge to a 1998 law
that extends by 20 years the lifetime of all existing copyrights and
increases the lifetime of future copyrights from 50 to 70 years after the
death of the creator. The legislation, called the Sonny Bono Copyright Term
Extension Act, was named after the late Sonny Bono, congressman and former
entertainer. Stanford University law professor Lawrence Lessig, an attorney
for one of the groups seeking to declare the legislation unconstitutional,
says the case is important "so that the next Walt Disney can do to Disney
what Disney did to Grimm's fairy tales" -- entirely transform material
taken from the public domain. But the court likely will focus not on the
substance of the law but on the issue of whether the law extends a
copyright's duration far longer than what was envisioned by the framers of
the Constitution. Wayne State University law professor Jessica Litman
argues: "It's important for the Supreme Court to reassert that there's no
copyright exception in the Constitution that Congress can do whatever it
pleases. Congress has limited powers." Lawyers for the government insist
that there are no legal precedents barring Congress from enacting the
legislation. (Washington Post 20 Feb 2002)
http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35750-2002Feb19.html
[BTW, this case was originally going to be called "Hart v Reno" but was
changed to Eldred v Reno when Lessig refused to include any of my own
comments, such as as the Disney references above.  With the new atty gen,
it is now called "Eldred v Ashcroft."  Perhaps they have a better chance
now that they have included a wider range of arguements, but Pres. Bush
has made it a project to make sure it loses. . . .]

NINE STATES WANT TO SEE MICROSOFT WINDOWS CODE
Nine states that were plaintiffs in the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit are
holding out for harsher penalties against that company, and they're asking
the judge to make Microsoft give them the actual Windows code so they can
make their case. They say that the legal questions in the case "cannot be
fairly resolved when the very subject matter in dispute is hidden from all
but Microsoft's own employees." Microsoft's position is that the state
attorneys general have aligned themselves with the company's competitors and
could therefore not be trusted to have access to Microsoft's valuable
intellectual property. (San Jose Mercury News 13 Feb 2002)
http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/2666382.htm

NINE STATES SUING MICROSOFT WILL GET COPIES OF WINDOWS CODE
The nine states suing Microsoft because their attorneys general want more
substantial sanctions imposed on the company for antitrust violations have
requested copies of the source code for Windows, and Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly has granted that request. "It seems to me that if your side
has access to it, then the other side, frankly, should have access to it."
The nine states want to impose a requirement that Windows operating system
be sold without the Internet Explorer software for browsing the Web, in
order to encourage competition; however, Microsoft has always insisted that
Internet Explorer is an integral part of the operating system. (New York
Times 19 Feb 2002)

LICENSING FEE TAKING A BITE OUT OF APPLE
MPEG LA, a company representing owners of patents related to
MPEG-4, wants to charge licensing fees to content providers that
distribute video in the MPEG-4 compression format. Apple Computer,
one such provider, opposes this policy and will not release its
QuickTime 6 and QuickTime Broadcaster products until the policy
can be amended. Lawrence Horn, vice president of MPEG LA, said
that his group would charge service or content providers about 2
cents per hour of paid-video streams, while an additional 25
cents will be levied for each software unit used to disseminate
and play the material. International Data (IDC) analyst Susan
Kevorkian believes that Apple's opposition to the licensing fee
should produce some significant results. "Short term, there will
be some revenue loss, but Apple has enough influence that
ultimately the licensing rules will be negotiated," she predicted.
(San Francisco Chronicle Online, 13 February 2002)

COMCAST TO STOP COLLECTING WEB-SURFING DATA
Comcast has decided to stop collecting data on its customers'
Web-surfing activities due to privacy complaints. The company
maintains it did nothing wrong and only used the information in
aggregate form to speed its network. By identifying the most
popular sites of its users, Comcast was able to cache those sites
for faster delivery later. Comcast, which acquired Excite@Home's
cable broadband network late last year, has 950,000 subscribers
for its high-speed Internet service. It has been porting its new
customers over to its own infrastructure. Privacy advocates and
many Comcast users had blasted the company for collecting the data,
but Proskauer Rose partner Christopher Wolf said those concerns
were most likely unfounded.  (Philadelphia Inquirer, 14 February 2002)

[Possible Relation To Corporate Takeover Of World Water Supply]
AN ORDER TO DESTROY A CD-ROM RAISES CONCERNS
College and university librarians are disturbed by a federal
order to destroy a CD-ROM containing data deemed too sensitive
for public distribution. The CD-ROM, disseminated by the U.S.
Geological Survey, contains information about national water
supplies. The government ordered its destruction on the grounds
that America's enemies could exploit this information. Copies of
the CD-ROM were handed out to libraries participating in the
Federal Depository Library Program. Ruth Parlin, director of
Castleton State College's Calvin Coolidge Library, noted that
security-sensitive documents are usually not included in the
program, making this turn of events "problematic." Patrice
McDermott of the American Library Association said the
government's request ran contrary to the ALA's code of ethics,
which is against censorship. "This is part of a bigger issue of
restriction of access to government information on the Web and
elsewhere," she explained.
