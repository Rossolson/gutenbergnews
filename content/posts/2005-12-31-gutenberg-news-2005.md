  * **December 13, 2005:** [Robert Sheckley](http://www.gutenberg.org/authors/Robert_Sheckley "author:Robert_Sheckley"){.extiw}, one of the few authors represented with copyrighted works at Project Gutenberg, died December 9 at age 77 in Poughkeepsie. According to a <a href="http://www.sheckley.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.sheckley.com" rel="nofollow">New York times obituary</a>, Sheckley "is considered one of science fiction's seminal humorists, and a precursor to <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/infocomjava.html" class="external text" title="http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/infocomjava.html" rel="nofollow">Douglas Adams</a>"; but "a better comparison might be to [Kafka](http://www.gutenberg.org/authors/Franz_Kafka "author:Franz_Kafka"){.extiw}, a fabulist who could never understand why his friends didn't laugh when he read his stories to them". (We don't actually have Adams; but the link is to a free online text adventure game by him.)
  * **November 01, 2005:** Sony CD installs "rootkit". If you stay away from file sharing networks because you fear virus infections, you'll also have to stay away from copy-protected CDs from now on. At least one commercially distributed Sony CD has been found to install a "rootkit" software which should prevent user from making copies of the CD. A naive removal of the "rootkit" files will make the system CD drive unusable.
