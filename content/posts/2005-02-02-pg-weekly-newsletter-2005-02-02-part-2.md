.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.org/find

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.org/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

Louis Lambert, by Honore de Balzac                                        1943

Add editor and translator:

   [Language: French]
   [Ed.: P. Lorain]
   [Tr.: P. Grolier]
   (Note to our readers:  we would greatly appreciate verification of the
    attribution of editor, as we have forgotten more than we have ever
    learned of the French language.  Which actually means something pretty
    close to absolutely nothing.)

                        [ This Week's Other Stuff ]
=============================================================================

&gt;From David Price, about #14865, Gwaith Alun:

For those wishing to know: Alun (pronounced Alin) was born in 1797 in
Mold, North Wales.  His real name was John Blackwell.  He didn't receive
much education as a child but showed a great interest in literature
(English and Welsh).  A group of local well-to-do people were impressed
by him and got together enough money to fully educate him.  He went to
Oxford University in 1824.  Later he became a clergyman in Manordeifi
(Wales) until his death in 1841.  The book is collection of his works,
mainly in Welsh although a few letters in English have been included.

Since many people who see the Gutenberg releases don't read Welsh and
might be interested in seeing a specimen translation of the work here's
a verse from Can Gwraig Y Pysgotwr (Song of the Fisherman's Wife):

         Hush, restless wave! and landward gently creeping,
                 No longer sullen break;
         All nature now is still and softly sleeping,
                 And why art thou awake?
         The busy din of earth will soon be o'er,
         Rest thee, oh rest upon thy sandy shore.

Always acknowledge a fault. This will throw those in authority off their
guard and give you an opportunity to commit more.  -Mark Twain

And yes I said yes today is the 83rd anniversary of the first
publication of Ulysses.
