Subject: March Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
Date: Wed, 4 Mar 1998 16:24:31 -0600 (CST)


*This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for March 4, 1998


Passing another milestone:


We should be posting Etext #1250 this month, which would be
a total of 1/8 of our goal of 10,000 Etexts on the Internet.


At that time the following will become true:


$1 Trillion Given Away By Project Gutenberg

We have now given away $1 trillion worth of Etexts:  based on Etexts
being nominally valued at $8 each to an average of 100 million users
on the 2 billion computers in the world.

**To avoid the difference between American and other -illions, where
each successive name is multiplied by a million instead of where the
Americans multiply by only a thousand, please use the following:  **

We have now given away $1,000,000,000,000 in Etexts, based on Etexts
being nominally valued at $8 each to an average of 100,000,000 users
on the 2,000,000,000 computers in the world.

In August we should be able to reduce that nominal value to $7, then
next March to $6, and on 1/1/2000 to $5 as a nominal value per book;
and when we finally reach #10,000, it will take only a truly nominal
value of $1 each for Project Gutenberg to have given away a trillion
dollars worth of Etexts, even if we still only reach 100 million for
the average number to use each Etext, out of a world population that
will be between 6 billion and 7 billion, with 2 billion to 3 billion
computers for them to use, perhaps even 4 billion by that time.  The
current world population is now exactly 5.9 billion, as of today; it
should be 6 billion by the time we reach the millennium].


Recently released:

William the Conqueror by E.A. Freeman[Saved #1066][wlmcnxxx.xxx]1066
We wanted to make the obvious connection from year 1066 to book 1066

If you would like to reserve any of the dates between 1225 and 2000,
just let me know.  Example:  something on Columbus for #1492, and on
his later trips, Magellan, etc., for the next few Etexts.

Requests:
Madame Bovary
Emerson
Yeats
Tennyson
Byron
Verne's Off On A Comet
George Eliot's Ramola
20 Years at Hull-House by Jane Addams
Brecht
J.M. Barrie's Little White Bird [First Peter Pan appearance]


We still need someone to help us create a "hit counter" for
relaying hits to other Etext sources, so they get credited.
This is VERY important for some of them to get grants, etc.

GATES SAYS GOVERNMENT ACTIONS HAMPERS MICROSOFT'S ABILITY TO INNOVATE
Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates says that if the Justice Department
prevents the company from adding new features to its Windows software,
Microsoft will lose its ability to remain a technology industry leader.
Gates argues: "It's hard to say that you're going to compromise on your
ability to innovate in Windows.  If I can't put Internet support in Windows,
then Windows will fail. If I can't put speech recognition into Windows,
Windows will fail. You know, our path is to make Windows better.  If we
can't innovate in our products, then you know we will be replaced."
(Washington Post 3 Mar 98)

MICROSOFT SOFTENS POSITION
Microsoft says it is revising agreements with about 12 U.S. and 30 European
Internet service providers to allow them advertise and promote browsers
other than Microsoft's own Internet Explorer.  A company spokesman
explained:  "This change makes sense from a business perspective, and if it
helps to alleviate any potential government concerns, then it's a change
we're happy to make."  (Washington Post 2 Mar 98)

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]


You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]


To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"

	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.


Thanks to all our supporters!!
