  Design Guidelines for Electronic Publications, Multimedia and the Web
</h4>

Properly designed e-books, software, Web sites and learning management systems can and must be accessible to all users with disabilities. Technology is prevalent everywhere, and learners of all ages and in all fields require equal access to content to keep pace with their colleagues and classmates.
Whether they are high school students, IT professionals or research chemists, inaccessible materials prevent people with disabilities from using the same materials at the same time as their peers, and can limit their educational and career opportunities.

[Visit the WGBH website](http://ncam.wgbh.org/publications/adm/) to access the complete guidelines.
