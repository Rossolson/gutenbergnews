<pre>The Project Gutenberg Year In Review of January 7, 2009

eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


As many of you are aware, the Project Gutenberg year is from noon of the first
Wednesday of a year to the next.

Thus, I have to wait until noon today to get the finals of our various
categories, though some will not be here in time, due to the normal delays,
and will be marked.




New Project Gutenberg Landmarks and Headlines



The Complete "CIA World Factbooks"


The latest project to be completed, just last night, as a matter of fact, is
"The CIA Factbook," complete, from 1990 to 2008.  It has been many years of
hunting to get all the years, and even more to reformat the files from their
originals to something easier to search.

2008, since it is still officially in flux until July 1 or thereabouts, is
still in PrePrints:

http://www.preprints.readingroo.ms/factbook2008

On July 1, the new 2009 edition will be authorized, but it usually doesn't
appear until Aug, Sep, or even Oct.

If any of you would like to keep an eye out for it, I'd greatly appreciate it,
as it sometimes appeared without any real announcements, and we'd like to get
it up with as little delay as possible.

Also, if anyone can located any pre-1990 editions, that would also be greatly
appreciated.




Project Gutenberg Is Now A Firefox Plugin


If you look through the provided list of search engines that appear in the
upper right hand of [my] Firefox you may note that along with Google, Merriam-
Webster, and a handful of others, you'll find Project Gutenberg with a place
in that list of great places to search.




Chinese Moves Into Our Top 5 List


As has been noted in our recent Monthly Newsletters, we have finally managed
to do nearly 400 eBooks in Chinese and to start to do justice to the most
spoken language.

Note:  The collection of 307 Chinese Preprints eBooks I mentioned in earlier
Newsletters, has been "retired."

This means we are no longer sure they will be done, for lack of copyright
research, etc.  They are still there, waiting, if you would care to see if you
can bring even just a few of them, into general circulation.


Statistical Note:  I am counting the 307 in the totals, for 2008, but not
2009, since they appeared from all of the year ending a week ago.  There is a
method to these madnesses, and that is that if I officially removed the 307, I
would have to move in a couple thousand that are waiting in the wings, and we
prefer to balance the year
2008 with 2009 as well as possible.  So by eliminating, as it were, 307
between the official years, 2009 should still come out well ahead due to the
new thousands that will be put in PrePrints as soon as possible.




Spanish Is Our New Goal for Entry Into the Top 5 List


I desperately need some Spanish speaking people to help me!

This project is somewhat on hold, as the sponsor are still, as we speak, on
their holiday vacations.


Note:  You can find many more books in other languages at:

http://www.gutenberg.cc

where there are over 75,000 books, half in other languages.





Project Gutenberg Books Equal The Average Library



We also officially passed 32,000 original Project Gutenberg eBooks this past
year, including all our usual listings.

This means the original Project Gutenberg editions now list as many book
titles as the average U.S. public library.


Reminder:

The difference between


http://www.gutenberg.org

and

http://www.gutenberg.cc


is that most of the books at gutenberg.org are put through a rigorous internal
screening, proofreading and formatting before they are ever entered into our
catalog, as WE would be responsible for correcting any errors.

The books at gutenberg.cc have been donated by other eBook producers and
eLibraries around the world, hundreds of the world's best collections are
represented.  However, eBooks at gutenberg.cc are the responsibility of the
donors so we can't fix the errors without their permission, or else our
edition differs from theirs.  So usually we have to wait a while as they make
various updates and corrections.




Project Gutenberg PrePrints



Please note that PrePrints now has over 2,000 books!!!

Well worth looking into:

http://www.preprints.readingroo.ms


We could use someone to write a piece about PrePrints.


The books in PrePrints are usually waiting for some final, necessary, "missing
piece" of information before complete, and ready to be entered into our
permanent catalog.

However, we don't want to deprive the general readership's access to these
books just on a technicality, one which is sometimes going to take years to
resolve, so we put them a stone's throw away from our original collection,
with some words of warning.



The News In More Detail



The times are changing, and we can either lead or follow.


If we don't lead in the field of Chinese eBooks we follow-- and we are
starting a Project Gutenberg of Chinese, for all who may wish to get in on the
ground floor.

Believe it or not, Spanish is listed as the third language, with regard to its
use on the entire Internet so that's the next goal, to bring Spanish to out
Top 5.


Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!



FLASH RAM


I am still looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the Poqet computer, etc.
One of these for an HP is coming.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems and these were OEMed
by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular in a recognizable fashion because their
snapon connectors resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.




POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.

And in other languages.



Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and totals from PG of
Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.




The 2008 Statistical Year in Review



These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at

http://www.gutenberg.cc

Where there are eBooks representing over 100 languages.



These are the various totals from the ~30,000 at

http://www.gutenberg.org

and our other Project Gutenberg Sites

(448 other titles have been
retired/promoted/published,
and will be listed as such,
starting next Newsletter.)

2008 CIA World Factbook. The editions prior to 2008 are already in the main
collection but the 2008 edition is subject to change until mid-2008. We have
the current edition copied here, until then, as both a large .zip

Note  Without counting PrePrints, we are still 30,000 plus and some of the new
.lit collection will not make it under our current rules of addition from
PrePrints, and would be deleted from PrePrints without moving to other
listings.

The next Newsletter will start with 448 less PrePrints, unless we already have
the new Chinese 2,000+ already.

Note  There are perhaps 100 eBooks not listed here that are already in
circulation from Project Gutenberg.

Note  PG Canada includes English, French, and Italian.
