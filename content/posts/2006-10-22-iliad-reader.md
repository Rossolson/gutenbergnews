The iLiad makes use of the amazing e-Ink screen technology but is more than just a reader. Unlike the Sony Reader the iLiad also allows you to write to the device using a stylus. It is more akin to a PDA than a pure reading device. This feature comes at price; reduced battery life (though still much better than a regular PDA) and higher cost.

Here is what the iRex website says about the iLiad;

**What is the iRex iLiad?**

The iLiad is a portable device that allows you to read digital content any where at any time.

**Comfortable Reading (From Digital Print)**

  * The Electronic Paper Display technology reads just like normal paper and is perceived as such by the human eye.
  * Easy navigation based upon reading behaviour.
  * Scalable text. You can change the font size of your text to suit your own reading comfort. (Format and DRM dependant.)

**Read...and Write**

  * Touch screen with stylus.
  * Use the iLiad as your notepad.
  * Write and comment in articles (format and DRM dependant.)

**Mobility and Convenience**

  * The iLiad is a lightweight device for both indoor and outdoor use.
  * Indoor reading: The device is designed for relaxed reading at home and productive reading in the office or workplace.
  * Reading outdoors: You are now able to read digital text in full sunlight, just like paper.
  * A mobile device: The lightweight iLiad is the size of an A5 document (folded letter sized document) (approximately), with a screen large enough to accommodate nearly all content, but small enough to take with you wherever you go.
  * Very low power: You can read three hours a day for more than one week, from the iLiad without recharging the battery.
