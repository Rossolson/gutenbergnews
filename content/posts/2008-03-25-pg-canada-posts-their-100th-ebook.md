We've just posted the 100th eBook. It's from 1904, seems not to have been reprinted, and is a very interesting account of Toronto's legal establishment in the 19th century: it's a rather spectacular addition to the collection. Here's the description from the website:

> 2008/03/25: As our 100th eBook, we've chosen this beautifully illustrated history of Toronto's lawyers and judiciary – A true rarity and a delight to read, packed with anecdotes. You may end up thinking that the history of Toronto is the history of its lawyers!
>
> Hamilton, James Cleland (1836-1907) [Canadian lawyer]
> Osgoode Hall – Reminiscences of the Bench and Bar (1904) [History]

Rescuing excellent titles like this from undeserved oblivion is one of the great pleasures of having a Literary Archive.
