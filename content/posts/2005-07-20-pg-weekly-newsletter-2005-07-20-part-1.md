**The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, July 20, 2005 PT1**
*******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971******


           We have produced ~1800 eBooks in 28 weeks this year!

It took us from July 1971 to Jul 1999 to produce our first 1800 eBooks!

               That's 28 WEEKS as Compared to ~28 Years!!!


My apologies, there is still some disagreement on the exact number of books
done this week, and therefore this year and in total.  I hope to start work
examining the numbers next week, after I finish jury duty.  I am planning a
weekend off, after jury duty, but don't really expect to get it.   :-)  But
I hope to get these numbers worked out by next week, as our people have the
numbers, it is just that _I_ have not had time to catch up.

Actually, I took the time right now to make the following updates from some
older numbers to newer ones:

Wk  Date    old#    new#
21,06/01/05, 69  &lt;&lt;== 70
22,06/08/05, 62  &lt;&lt;== 61
23,06/15/05, 48
24,06/22/05, 45
25,06/29/05, 41
26,07/06/05, 74
27,07/13/05, 61  &lt;&lt;== 63
28,07/20/05, 56

and thus, while this Newsletter his going out a few minutes later than usual,
it contains these up to date counts:

Year to date:  1,796
Grand total:  16,752

My apologies to all concerned for not getting this corrected sooner!

Michael



Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com

Please note that we are still in the process of correcting our statistical
program data.  Last week we subtracted a few that we thought had been in a
duplicate count situation, but either that correction didn't stick or some
new similar problem has occured.  As always, the total count should be the
consideration of some attention as to possibly being off by a few eBooks.

Please note that PT2 of this Newsletter is currently in flux, as we shift
from to an automated PT2 sender.  The situation with Monthly Newsletters
is in flux to an even greater degree.  Our apologies as we make changes.

PROJECT GUTENBERG OF EUROPE TAKES OFF!!!

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE" STARTS REGULAR ACTIVITY

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]


This past month marked the official beginnings of our
new companion, Project Gutenberg of Europe with eBook
entries expected in over 100 languages.  In the first
month we have seen a total of 100 about eBooks and an
assortment of 65 articles in total, thus representing
62 Eurasian languages and dialects.  Volunteer effort
is totally responsible for these, and your assistance
to PGE would be greatly appreciated in creating eBook
titles from all of the ~120 languages and dialects in
which PGE hope to produce eBooks.


After a year of preparation "Project Gutenberg Europe", organized by
"Project Rastko Network" and its "Distributed Proofreaders Europe",
started regular activity last month, now having now its own server
provided by leading South Eastern European provider "EUnet".

PGE and its branches operate under European copyright legislation
(life+50 and life+70).

It already has volunteers all over the continent: European Community,
Comonwealth of Independent States [ex-USSR] and other countries.

"Distributed Proofreaders Europe"--as central European PD digitizing system,
and only Unicode is capable of that kind in the world at the moment--releases
a multilingual "European Proofing Package" of books this month, as special
choices of general interest for whole continent.

Also, regional and national campaigns in European countries were scheduled
between May 31 and June 30, including first wave of physical events--
conferences and promotions--in Eastern Europe (Macedonia, Serbia, etc).

[For details please email hart AT pglaf.org]

Darwin!!!

Would anyone like to work on reproofing our Darwin collection
and creating a compilation file as requested by our readers.

We could also use some help making some new editions of
"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes" and "Frankenstein."

v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

http://homepage.mac.com/ptwobrussell/podreader.html

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

REQUEST FOR RUSSIAN TRANSLATOR

We are trying to start up a Project Gutenberg Russian Team,
and we need someone to translate simple email messages from
members of Project Gutenberg who want to provide a service
to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,
we need them translated into English, also in a .doc file.
Thanks!!!     Contact Jared Buck  &lt;JBuck814366460@aol.com&gt;

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.


*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

CIA's Electronic Reading Room,      2,019 Reference Files
=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,455,073,164 that would be 16,750 x 64,550,732  = 1.08 Trillion !!!

With 16,764 eBooks online as of July 20, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.92 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,550,732 x 16,750 x $.92 = ~$1 trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 16,750 eBooks online as of July 20, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.60 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.75 when we had 13,295 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is about 1.5% of the world's population!

At 16,750 eBooks in 34 Years and 00.50 Months We Averaged
      ~492 Per Year

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

U.S. LOSING GROUND IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

[No matter how you slice it, in 1970 the United States had over double
the share of world college students as it did just three decades later.
Over 30% dropped to under 15%.  As I have been saying here for years,
keep your eye on China, India and then Indonesia.]

Confirming the suspicions of many, a new report from the National
Bureau of Economic Research indicates that the United States is
steadily losing ground to a number of other countries, particularly
China, in the number of PhDs it awards in science and engineering
fields. In 1970, nearly one-third of the world's college students
attended a college or university in the United States, and more than
half of the science and engineering PhDs were awarded by U.S. schools.
A number of global factors contributed to those numbers, making them
artificially high. Since that time, however, higher education around
the world, and especially programs in science and engineering, has
greatly expanded, leaving the United States with just 14 percent of the
world's college students by 2001. According to the report, China could
surpass the United States as early as 2010 in the number of science and
engineering PhDs it awards.

TEXAS INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP JOINT DIGITAL LIBRARY

[If this program "will not include books," then how can it be
"aimed broadly at public users?"]

Rice University and four university systems in Texas have announced a
partnership to create a digital repository of online resources aimed
broadly at public users. Dubbed the Texas Digital Library, the
repository will pool the efforts of Rice University, the Texas A&M
University System, the Texas Tech University System, the University of
Houston System, and the University of Texas System. Initially, at
least, the repository will offer various resources online, including
teaching aids and practical information, but will not include books.
Fred Heath, vice provost of the University of Texas Libraries, said
that the program was conceived as a resource largely for individuals
outside the walls of academia, fulfilling in some measure the charge of
public higher education to serve the public good. The budget for the
project has not yet been finalized. Heath said he hopes the repository
will be online by the end of the year, but the timing will depend on
having sufficient content available for users.

EC RAIDS INTEL OFFICES
As part of an ongoing investigation of antitrust allegations against
Intel, the European Commission (EC) this week conducted raids on Intel
offices around Europe and on computer makers and retailers. The EC
began looking into antitrust concerns more than four years ago, but the
investigation was left idle for lack of evidence in 2002. After
antitrust authorities in Japan began looking into Intel's business in
2004, the EC reopened its investigation. Intel competitors have charged
the chip maker with unfairly using its position in the market to
pressure computer manufacturers and retailers to use its products.
Critics also charge Intel with abusing a rebate program, which reward
computer makers for using its chips. The Japanese Fair Trade Commission
in March found Intel guilty of violating that country's regulations
with the rebate program. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices has sued
Intel for $55 million in Japan and has filed a separate action in U.S.
courts.

MUNICIPAL NETWORK APPROVED FOR LAFAYETTE, LA
In the latest battle over municipal broadband networks, voters of
Lafayette, Louisiana, approved a bond issue to fund the development of
a network that will serve the city's nearly 120,000 residents. As in
other localities, the phone and cable companies that serve the area
objected to the proposed network, arguing that the city has no business
offering a service that competes with those offered by the private
sector.

In related news, taxi firms across the USA are planning to sue
municipalities for providing bus services to residents...

In the latest battle over municipal broadband networks, voters of
Lafayette, Louisiana, approved a bond issue to fund the development of
a network that will serve the city's nearly 120,000 residents. As in
other localities, the phone and cable companies that serve the area
objected to the proposed network, arguing that the city has no business
offering a service that competes with those offered by the private
sector. City officials argued that they can provide cheaper service to
more residents than the cable and phone companies, whom they accused of
spending more effort lobbying politicians than offering services the
city needs. The issues facing Lafayette are being taken up by a number
of other municipalities across the United States, and 14 states have
already passed legislation that outlaws or limits cities and towns from
providing Internet services that compete with those offered by local
companies. At the national level, competing bills have been introduced
in the U.S. House of Representatives, one to explicitly allow municipal
networks and the other to ban them.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

In the wake of a United States Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. New
London on eminent domain last week, a California man has proposed that
Justice David Souter's New Hampshire home be seized by the state and a
hotel be built on the site. Logan Darrow Clements faxed a letter to
town officials in Weare, New Hampshire June 28, 2005 that justified
the action as such:

"The justification for such an eminent domain action is that our hotel
will better serve the public interest as it will bring in economic
development and higher tax revenue to Weare."

Justice Souter, who was in the majority ruling in the Kelo case, has
lived at the farmhouse in Weare since he was 11 years old. Clements
indicated that it was necessary to build on that location because "it
is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for
destroying property rights for all Americans." The action has given
rise to a great deal of support nationwide, as many are writing to the
councilors of the small town of Weare to voice their approval for the
proposal.

The proposal for the "Lost Liberty Hotel", as it is to be called,
features a number of components which seem to focus on the libertarian
leanings of its designer. A dining room, called the "Just Desserts
Cafe" and a museum based on the "loss of freedom in America" are two
such components. Instead of a Gideon's Bible (a standard item placed
in most American hotel rooms), each guest will receive a free copy of
Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged.

As reported above:

In 1970 United States colleges enrolled over 30% of world students.

In 2001 United States colleges enrolled under 15% of world students.

50 million Americans live in various kinds "gated communites."

That means out of just a handful of people, one is most likely
living in such an "arranged community."

*

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
