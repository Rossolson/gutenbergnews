CELL PHONE eBOOKS, by John Mizzi

Cell phone technology is moving in leaps and bounds and the price is falling
as all other computer technologies.  Bandwidth between phones and the web is
also increasing, but the number of users using the phone to browse the web is
not increasing as it should be.  This is due to the excessive price that most
phone operators charge for the download of data from web to phone.  If there
is a download plan it is usually for a tiny amount of data such as 8MB per
month.
So as things stand now, phone WAP [Wireless Application Protocol] and Web
browsing are limited to wealthy phone users only.  This is a very sad fact
because cell / mobile phones can be used to receive and send information
from anywhere at anytime without having to have a power hungry computer in
front of you running down those big batteries.

The cheapest way to read on cell phones is by loading the documents straight
to the phone from the computer using cable, bluetooth, or infra red ports,
NOT to pay through the nose for online billing charges that wildly exceed the
costs of the same number of converation minutes.
Some smartphones can take limited size PDF files and usually these
smartphones are very expensive to the average user. This problem has been
resolved at http://www.mobilebooks.org.

There you can freely download over 5,000 converted Project Gutenberg ebooks
to work on most java enabled cell phones (95% of modern phones).

These ebooks can be downloaded to cell / mobile phones, straight from
http://www.mobilebooks.org by users plugging their cell phone to their
computer using cable, bluetooth or infra red.  All the 5000+ cell phone
Gutenberg ebooks are available for free to the public.  So try it and have
fun reading anytime and anywhere.

that's ~266 eBooks per Month for ~69.50 Months.


NOTES:

Project Gutenberg Australia total does NOT include PGAu eBooks posted at the
U.S. site: www.gutenberg.org

We have several counting methods, and they often differ by several books
that we have to hunt down by hand to reconcile. There is also some
duplication between these various collections. Volunteers will need to take
these duplications into account.

The totals for the four collections are eBooks that originated as created,
edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and its 50,000
volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with 100,000+ books
contains entire eBook collections from 125+ eLibraries so the production
statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created by the various
teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share the responsibility
of maintaining. The Consortia Center eBooks were and are the responsibility
of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy to forward any suggestions
for correction to those eLibraries, but those eBooks must be edited by the
donating parties, as per their requests.


=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=[ OTHER STATISTICS ]=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=

SNAIL MAIL (DVD & CD)
Over 15 million eBooks have been sent out via snail mail!!!


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS:
9,285 [+17] at Distributed Proofreaders

The Distributed Proofreaders started production in October 2000 and
currently has over 36,000 volunteers.

For more complete DP statistics, visit:
http://www.pgdp.net/c/stats/stats_central.php

NOTE: PGDP mostly included in US eBooks
NOTE: PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders whose total closely matches
      their grand total.


PGCC - PROJECT GUTENBERG CONSORTIA CENTER REPORT
137,142 eBooks at PGCC

The PGCC collection at http://www.gutenberg.cc has doubled in size from the
listings below, but we don't have exactly matching collection sizes yet for a
new breakdown.

There are ~185,000 separate downloadable files, and presuming 45% are
redundant or are required at the level of more than one file per book:

The number of individual eBooks now is about 100,000.

Thus the grand total of eBooks at Project Gutenberg is 21,000+ created by
Project Gutenberg volunteers, and 100,000 donated from over 125 other
eLibraries, to create a downloadable library of 100,000+ eBooks plus 80,000
donated from over 100 other eLibraries, to create a downloadable library of
100,000+ eBooks.

PGCC's current eBook and eDocument Collections listings of 18 collections with
this week's listing as:

[This list is being updated as the moment, you can get the entire list on the
collections pages at gutenberg.cc]

=======Grand Total Files=======  ~137,142 Total Files  ========

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


DAILY PREPRINTS
378 [+ 0] at Daily PrePrints

Stats available at: http://preprints.readingroo.ms

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire collections to fully
appear in the PrePrints Section, thus the count sometimes jumps by a large
number when the files are eventually completed and added in. Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move later to other
locations, including the main collection or The Project Gutenberg Consortia
Center, etc. For example, on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks
appeared, and will likely be moved to other collection points later.

The entire process of working out the details just to send them to the PrePrints
Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section, it still takes a
certain amount of time to collect and put such a large collection online in a
proper manner.


THE ONLINE BOOKS PAGE
25,000 eBooks are listed via The Online Books Page

NOTE: 6,300 of these are from PG.


INTERNET PUBLIC LIBRARY
22,284 entries at IPL

The Internet Public Library (IPL) had a similar listing to The Online Books Page
which is now in limbo. If anyone knows what is happening with the IPL, please
let us know. Inquiries, made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:
http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended its first incarnation
with about 22,284 entries, which has now been surpassed by the Online Books
Page.

We are still looking for more Internet Public Library info.
