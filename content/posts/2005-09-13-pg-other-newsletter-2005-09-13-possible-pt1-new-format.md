Subject: [gweekly] Possible PT1 New Format
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.60.0509130841060.30533@pglaf.org&gt;


I am considering cutting PT1 into two sections, PT1A and PT1B,
as several people have suggested that the new portions should
be presented in one place, while the repetitive portions will
be presented separately.

Right now I have placed markers that say:

***BREAK FOR PT1A AND PT1B***

where such a break would take place, with perhaps a bit of an
adustment to take place after a few tries to get everything a
bit more sorted out for the new format.

Your comments are requested.

Thanks!!!
