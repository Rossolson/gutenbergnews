go to the portions you find most interesting:  1.  Founder's Comments,
2. News, Notes & Queries, and  3. Weekly eBook Update Listing.]


  This is Michael Hart's "Founder's Comments" section of the Newsletter


Over Our 32 8/53 Year History, We Have Now Averaged About 275 Ebooks/Year
And This Year Averaged Over That Same New eBook Level. . .PER MONTH!!!!!


               We Are Averaging About 314 Per Month!!!


      This week I bought my 1st TERABYTE, and started on my 2nd.

The best deal I found was a 160G Maxtor for $80 with three rebates.
We had to buy something for $1.xx dollars to get the right price to
receive a $30 coupon, in addition to two rebates.  This is $.50/Gig.
I also got 200G Maxtors, with controllers, price was a bit higher...

$500, plus tax and shipping for .96 Terabytes. . .in six drives....

Next year perhaps 240G drives, and only no extra controllers needed
because it will only take 4 of them. . . .

*** Requests For Assistance

I am working on trying to collect and convert some public domain folk tunes
to ABC notation.  Could use some help tracking down public domain versions
of the melodies or proof that these songs are in the public domain.  Songs
I'm working on at present include:
I Know Where I'm Going
Simple Gifts
She Moved Throught The Fair
A Sailor Courted a Farmer's Daughter (aka Constant Lovers)
The Fisher Who Died in His Bed
Ufros Alienu
If anyone's interesting in converting folk songs to a digital public
domain format and would like to help or if you want to contact me, you can
do so through the mailing list at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pdsongs

Latin Is A Dying Language???
Latin Library (www.thelatinlibrary.com) died,
and was resurrected recently, bring attention
to the fact that we need to save these files,
find matching paper editions, and be sure the
files don't disappear.

If you would like to help with Latin eBooks,
please let me know.

We have a few volunteers for this who could
help coordinate your efforts, if you should
be able to locate any Latin books.

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me,
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November while
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

We are seeking pro bono or very cheap legal assistance to pursue
Project Gutenberg trademark infringers and similar issues.  Please
email Michael Hart &lt;hart@pobox.com&gt;.

[We received 3 replies from the US, 1 from Australia, but
may need more around December 10.]

The Future Of Project Gutenberg

We have had renewed interest in various areas of music, from publishing
more song lyrics and scores to listenable pieces in MIDI, WAV, and MP3.
We would LOVE to expand our Music Team to all kinds of music, classical,
folk, jazz, and music from a wide variety of countries and cultures.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://gutenberg.net/list.html  can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer.


--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO OUR LATEST eBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 33 weeks of this year, we have produced 2336 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 2336 eBooks!!!

         That's 33 WEEKS as Compared to 29 YEARS!!!


With 9,079 eBooks online as of August 20, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.10 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.585 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.73 when we had 5749 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 9,079 books each costing $.63 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 9,079 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 9079 eBooks in 32 Years and 2.50 Months We Averaged
    282 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     24 Per Month
    .79 Per Day

At 2336 eBooks Done In The 231 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     10 Per Day
     72 Per Week
    314 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.
This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


From Newsscan:

INTERNET STAYS LIGHT DURING BLACKOUT
During yesterday's blackout in northeast U.S. states and several major
Canadian cities, wireless networks and Internet connections allowed people
to keep communicating. The chief business officer of Equinix, which
operates Internet Business Exchange centers that serve more than 90% of the
world's Internet routes, explains: "We lost all utility power out there,
but we immediately went to battery power for a few seconds, at which point
all of our major generators kicked in" to allow normal operations that were
"totally seamless to customers." Internet customers therefore suffered "no
disruptions whatsoever" to their Internet service resulting from the
electrical system failures. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 15 Aug 2003)

[For Those Who Doubt There Are Billions Of Computers. . .at this growth rate
it only takes about 5 years for a billion more computers to be sold. . . .]

PC SALES COULD REACH NEW HIGH IN 2003
Gartner has adjusted its estimate of worldwide PC shipments upward to 161
million this year, hitting a new benchmark for the industry, says Gartner
analyst Kiyomi Yamada. Gartner recently rejiggered its method of accounting
for unit shipments to include units previously overlooked, says Yamada. The
error was revealed when Gartner noticed a discrepancy between the number of
components, such as processors, and the number of finished PCs. The
difference pointed to a previously unrecognized market for so-called
white-box PCs -- machines that are usually assembled and sold by small
companies. Gartner has since gone back and revised its PC unit shipment
numbers for at least the past six years, boosting those figures
accordingly. Meanwhile, IDC has predicted a 2003 unit shipment increase of
6.3% to 145 million, but analyst Roger Kay says the firm may revise those
numbers upward, based on hot sales of notebook computers.

[Napster Was Right. . .And Is NOT Being Allowed To Play]

MICROSOFT TEAMS WITH UK FIRM ON EUROPEAN MUSIC SERVICE
Microsoft and London-based On Demand Distribution (OD2) have teamed up to
offer a pay-per-song pan-European Internet music service modeled after
Apple's popular U.S. iTunes service. OD2 possesses the largest catalog of
legal digital music in Europe, listing more than 200,000 tracks by 8,500
artists on all five record labels, plus a healthy representation of
independents. The downloads will be priced at 99 euro cents ($1.12) apiece
and can be accessed through the MSN Music Club or Tiscali Music Club using
Microsoft's Windows Media Player 9 software. The bold move has caught the
attention of European Union regulators who are still pursuing an antitrust
case against the software giant and have specifically targeted the Windows
Media Player software in their investigation. "We like that the European
consumer now has access to songs for 99 cents," says an EU spokesman, but
the new deal "reinforces the impression" that businesses are designing
services for Media Player because of its dominance. "This shows how
important it is to have your particular media player software linked to the
dominant desktop." (AP 14 Aug 2003)

[Never Believe ANYthing Has Been Erased!]

WEALTH OF CORPORATE SECRETS ON THE WEB
Many documents posted online may contain sensitive corporate or personal
information, according to AT&T researcher Simon Byers, who was able to
unearth hidden information from thousands of Microsoft Word documents
posted on the Web using an ordinary search engine and a random selection of
keywords. Byers targeted Word documents because they're so common, but he
stressed that other document formats, such as Adobe PDF, may contain
similar hidden information. After downloading the Word files, Byer used the
free software tools "antiword" and "catdoc" to convert them to plain text.
Then, using a simple script he wrote, Byers was able to locate text that
had been deleted from the original Word files, including people's names and
other personal identifiers, e-mail headers, network paths and text from
related documents. "The worst is erased text. This has bitten people
surprisingly often," says Bruce Schneier, a security expert with
Counterpane. Microsoft Office UK marketing manager Neil Laver says the
company is working on ways to better ensure sensitive information is not
inadvertently leaked in files. The next version of Office 2003 will include
tools that will allow users to remove personal information from documents
as well as new "information rights management" software that will enable an
author to determine who can read or forward a document. Meanwhile, Schneier
recommends converting documents to plain ASCII before publishing online: "I
don't know of any programs that effectively clean out the extra text."

RIVALS RATTLE GOOGLE WITH SEARCH INNOVATIONS
Google may be king of the hill in the search engine scene, but new
technologies introduced by competitors are aimed at shaking up the market.
One of the most technically interesting is Teoma, which was acquired by
AskJeeves in 2001. Teoma's advantage is that rather than relying on a page
ranking algorithm to determine how to list search results, it uses an
algorithm that reveals the Web "communities" around a particular topic and
what they're currently discussing. So that if you searched on "power
blackout" on Friday, Teoma's "refinements" section (on the right side of
the screen) included "electrical surge" and "cost of downtime." "It's a
great way to learn about a topic, or to find the precise thing for which
you are looking, without having to actually go to a lot of links," says
Wall Street Journal columnist Lee Gomes, who adds that AltaVista has
something similar on its Web site. And while the final outcome of the
search engine wars is still up in the air, "What's indisputable is that the
world of search engines is scene to more innovation and competition than
many folks realize," says Gomes. (Wall Street Journal 18 Aug 2003)

REALISTICALLY, YOU SHOULD PLAN TO GET A 64-BIT MACHINE
Apple already has 100,000 orders for its new $2,000-3,000 64-bit-processor
G5 machines, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) will be launching its 64-bit
Athlon 64 FX processor next month. Richard Heye of AMD predicts,
"Sixty-four-bit computing will take off faster than people think." A 64-bit
processor can theoretically handle 16 quintillion (i.e., 16 billion
billion) bytes of random access memory (RAM). Computer designer Richard
Doherty of the consulting firm Envisioneering says that 64-bit computing
"will put a tremendous amount of power into the hands of scientific
researchers and engineers first, and to a secondary degree to some artists
who want to express themselves in three-dimensional design." Even now,
Hollywood digital animation studios require at least two gigabytes of RAM
to render a single frame of some movies -- and adding even more realism to
computer graphics will increase RAM demands exponentially.(New York Times

[Satellite and Laptops. . .Now The Prevalent Modes Of Operation]

SATELLITE IS CHEAPER THAN CABLE
The price of satellite television reception has dropped below that of cable
for the first time ever, according to a new study by J.D. Power &
Associates. The price differential between the two competing technologies
has "narrowed significantly" over the last five years, with the current
average satellite TV cost up 8% to $48.93 a month. During the same time
period, the average cable TV bill has soared 41% to $49.62 a month. Much of
that increase is attributed to the cost of upgrading networks and adding
new services, such as digital TV and video-on-demand, but those efforts
haven't proven successful in boosting customer loyalty. "Digital cable
hasn't turned out to be the solution the cable industry needed to stem the
tide of migration to satellite providers," says J.D. Powers senior director
Steve Kirby. The report suggests cable providers should focus on improving
customer service and possibly bundling television with other services.

LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SEEKING PARTNERS FOR DIGITAL PROJECT
The Library of Congress is looking for partners for the National
Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program, whose goal
is to protect digital content from being lost. Applications are being
accepted through November 12 for awards of between $500,000 and $3
million, which will be distributed in February of next year. Organizers
of the program said it will work to create a system for gathering and
preserving content such as Web sites, electronic books and journals,
and films and sounds in electronic format. A spokesman for the Library
of Congress said that the project is not one that the library can do
without a group of committed partners.

INTERNET UNAFFECTED BY POWER FAILURE
According to Keynote Systems, which tracks performance of the Internet,
the power outage affecting parts of the northeastern United States and
Canada has not affected the Internet. A statement from Keynote Systems
noted that as of Thursday afternoon the Internet and all major U.S. Web
sites were performing normally. Cell phone call volume was extremely
high, however, causing congestion on networks that have been able to
keep operating on back-up power from generators. Sprint and Verizon
advised customers to be patient and indicated that some calls to the
east coast might be blocked to ensure availability for emergency calls.
