Edgar Allen Poe climbed the mountain at the southern tip of Moskenes
Island, Norway, during the violent riptide, before writing "Descent
Into The Maelstrom."  Bob Webster, of Junkmail / xpda.com and longtime
Gutenberg reader, recently flew his PC12 airplane from the US to Europe
by way of Moskenes Island.  Bob remarks that he knew that Poe had
ventured up that way only because he had downloaded and read "Descent,"
and recommends various Project Gutenberg publications to readers of all
ages.  Read the entire article, look at pictures of the mountain, and
download "Descent" in .rtf format in the July issue of Bob's "Junkmail"

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to only ONE DVD burner, on a laptop
belonging to a personal friend.  If you have a DVD burner
or plan to get one in the next 6 months, please email me,
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November while
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

We are seeking pro bono or very cheap legal assistance to pursue
Project Gutenberg trademark infringers and similar issues.  Please
email Michael Hart &lt;hart@pobox.com&gt;.

[We received 3 replies from the US, 1 from Australia, but
may need more around December 10.]

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 28 weeks of this year, we have produced 1885 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1999 to produce our FIRST 1885 eBooks!!!

         That's 28 WEEKS as Compared to 28 YEARS!!!


With 8,628 eBooks online as of July 09, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.16 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.81 when we had 5537 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 8,600+ books each costing $.65 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 8,600+ books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 8628 eBooks in ~32 Years and 00.25 Months We Averaged
    299 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     25 Per Month
     .8 Per Day

At 1885 eBooks Done In 2003 We Averaged
     10 Per Day
     70 Per Week
    302 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.
This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

Draft of Article:


"The Future Of Project Gutenberg After Our 10,000th eBook"

People have been asking me about the future of Project Gutenberg
this week of our 32nd anniversary:  how long we could keep up in
our efforts to continue at Moore's Law growth rates; grand total
of books we could expect to do if nothing after the Mickey Mouse
birthday in 1926 has a copyright expiration date, and our effort
to do books in more and more languages and cultures, etc., etc.

As for Moore's Law, this is a very difficult growth rate to keep
up with these days, requiring that we continue to keep up with a
growth rate approximately doubling every 18 months.  I make that
"approximately" because since 1990, we are somewhat ahead of the
Moore's Law growth curve, but just barely keeping up since 1993,
when we ended with 100 eBooks in December.  The "official" date,
given that we were a month ahead of schedule, was January, but I
recall that eBook #100, the Complete Works of Shakespeare, would
have been online overnight from December 10th to 11th, depending
on what time zone you were in.  [Some people worked on it from a
location in Hawaii, so we got a few extra hours.]

Given that we were on a monthly production rate back then, exact
dates weren't relevant, we only reported production on the first
Wednesday of each month, so comparisons from today to then would
not be terribly exact, other than on a monthly basis.

However, _I_ still try to keep up with that December 10th date--
it is an anniversary of my father's death--and he was an English
professor who specialized in Shakespeare.

My recollection is that Moore's Law would require something like
10,700 and something by December 10, 2003, so I announced 10,000
as our goal for that date, and figured we might get that 700 and
some by the end of the year, but it's going to be close, on both
counts, if you'll pardon the pun.

The real questions for the future are about getting to a million
by December 10, 2013, which is what it would take to keep up the
growth rate for the next decade at the same rate as for the last
decade of 1993 to 2003. . .100 times as many books each decade.

Personally, I am hoping we could get enough funding and exposure
after we get to 10,000 that we could actually DO 1,000,000 books
in the next decade, but obviously another decade would mean that
we would have to do 100,000,000 books, and that is probably more
books than will exist 20 years from now.

The solution is to tackle translating the one million books that
are already done into one hundred languages. . .something I fear
will put the Babelfish and Golden Bow projects to severe testing
to see if they can provide anything as useful as scanners became
10 years ago.  I should add here, that the first scanner I used,
huge and expensive as it was, was NOT worth the time it took and
I ended up coming back down here to my basement and typing books
in from scratch.  Translation is MUCH harder!!!  I would HOPE it
will be made a LOT easier by then!!!

So, in a nutshell, there it is. . .my plans for two more decades
of Project Gutenberg growing at Moore's Law growth rates.  Don't
expect a simple crossover between doing new books and languages,
I expect we will continue to encourage translations, to and from
all 100 languages we eventually hope to work in, and that public
domain legal standing may not quite suffer the complete disaster
planned for it by the copyright authorities of today, and, thus,
we might get to do some, or even most, of the publications after
1923, including music, various kinds of artwork and perhaps even
things we have not yet even considered for Project Gutenberg.

Hollywood, RIAA, and Network Television notwithstanding, and not
to leave out the paper tigers.

The 100,000,000 for December 10, 2023 could be any mixtures made
up of the following examples, or even include more options:

1,000,000 eBooks, each in 100 languages
2,000,000 eBooks, each in 50 languages
4,000,000 eBooks, each in 25 languages
5,000,000 eBooks, each in 20 languages

I would like to see the core of our collection translated into 5
languages in the next decade to gain some experience, perhaps:

[Alphabetically]

Chinese
French
German
Spanish
etc. . .

Doesn't have to be the same 5 languages for each book we try.

***

When considering the future of Project Gutenberg, one should not
only consider the number of books in our collection, but also an
approximation of how many people we expect to get them.

The original goal of Project Gutenberg was a multiple one:

1.  To Encourage The Creation And Distribution Of eBooks.

2.  To Create A Collection of 10,000 Project Gutenberg eBooks.

3.  To Get Those 10,000 eBooks To 100,000,000 Readers On The Average,
    TO GIVE AWAY A TOTAL OF ONE TRILLION = 1,000,000,000,000 eBooks.
    [100,000,000 readers is about 1.5% of the world population today]

When we accomplish this goal in about 5 months our goal will shift to
creating a collection totalling 1,000,000 and getting them to readers
totalling 1,000,000,000 = ONE BILLION READERS to give away a total of
1,000,000,000,000,000 = ONE QUADRILLION eBOOKS TO BE GIVEN AWAY. . .!

***

We also have to consider movies, television, music, photography,
etc., and we must therefore fine experts in the copyrights these
have as they are NOT the same as for written texts.

In addition, we will be moving into the area of doing more books
from before 1923, and thus doing research on copyright renewals.

***

In addition, I have been asked to address the question of formats:

Project Gutenberg always has promoted plain text eBooks to make books
available in the widest possible combinations of hardware & software,
and we will continue to do so.  We ARE considering various formats in
addition to plain text, and also considering doing something XMLish--
that may allow the creation of a wide variety of formats "on the fly"
if we can manage it.  Yes, we do have ONE eBooks that we posted ONLY!
in 8 bit format, as the volunteer did not want the French without the
proper accents.  Eventually that book will probably also appear in an
ordinary plain text format, but I promised it would have to come from
an outside source, as we promised we would abide by his wishes.  This
is just one mark of dedication to the Project Gutenberg volunteers, I
try not to be very bossy, as I think our volunteer should enjoy eBook
creation and distribution from start to finish.

!!!!!!!My HUGE Thanks To ALL Our Volunteers!!!!!!!

LAPTOPS OUTSELL DESKTOPS FOR FIRST TIME
Sales of laptop computers accounted for more than 54% of the total retail
computer sales in May, with laptop outpacing desktop sales for the first
time ever, according to NPD Group. In comparison, laptops represented less
than 25% of total sales as recently as January 2000. May also marked the
first time that sales of LCD screens surpassed traditional CRT monitors.
Analysts contribute the shift to consumers' desire for laptops'
"portability, appealing form factors and attractive design" as well as more
competitive pricing, says NPD analyst Stephen Baker. In addition, "LCDs'
slim profile and sleek looks are more appealing." (AP 2 Jul 2003)

MICROSOFT'S E-BOOK GIVEAWAY
In an effort to boost adoption of its Microsoft Reader software, the

Microsoft Reader has received 6 million downloads since its debut in August

Over the five-month promotion period, Microsoft Reader users will be able
to download three e-book bestsellers a week from the company's Web site via

LINUX: THE MAGICIAN AND THE MAGIC
Talking with the San Jose Mercury News, Linux creator Linus Torvalds gave
this explanation of the evolution of the Linux operating system since it
origination (when he spent six months personally writing the original
code): "It all boils down to hundreds of different groups. A group can be a
huge company that has an agenda. Or it can mean one person at a university
working on a research project. They have their own thing they want to fix.
All of these people make their modifications, and not all of them are
accepted. I see it as a kind of ecosystem. You have survival of the
fittest. Some changes work better. Sometimes it is for purely technical
reasons. It's just the right thing to do. Sometimes it is for personality
reasons. Some people who push their changes are more likely to get things
done because they are nicer about it. It's not really centralized. I am at
the center, but I don't direct any teams. All these people are trying to
pull me in different directions. Some groups pull together in the same
direction. It's a very dynamic situation." (San Jose Mercury News 4 Jul 2003)

OUT-OF-STATE TELECOMMUTER IS OUT OF LUCK
A telecommuter living in Florida and doing work for a company in New York
has been told by the highest court in New York that she's ineligible for
New York State unemployment benefits. The court ruled unanimously that the
eligibility for benefits depends not on where the employer is but on where
the worker is. Since about 28 million Americans telecommute, this decision
is likely to have implications for workers throughout the country. (AP/San

NETWORK EXTORTION
Oleg Zezev, a Kazakh man who hacked into the computer of the Bloomberg
media company in attempt to extort $200,000 from billionaire media mogul
(and now New York City major) Michael Bloomberg has been sentenced by a
Manhattan court to four years in prison and fined $950,000, or almost five
times the amount he hoped to extort. Judge Kimba Wood told Zezev: "Your

commerce and the integrity of data that the financial community relies upon
to do its business." (Australian IT News 3 Jul 2003)

COURT SAYS THUMBNAIL IMAGE LINKING IS FAIR USE
A federal appeals court ruled that a search engine's display of miniature
images of copyrighted works is allowed under fair use, upholding a similar
ruling in February 2002. The plaintiff in the case, photographer Leslie
Kelly, had sued image search engine firm Arriba Soft over thumbnail images
of her works that were accessible via Arriba's Ditto.com search engine.
Yesterday's decision, however, failed to confirm the legality of displaying
full-size images in search results -- a practice known as in-line linking
or framing -- and that case is now ordered to go to trial. "As to the first
action (on thumbnails), the district court correctly found that Arriba's
use was fair. However, as to the second action, we conclude that the
district court should not have reached the issue because neither party
moved for summary judgment as to the full-size images," according to the
opinion. The framing technique is used by a number of visual search
engines, including Google, Lycos and AltaVista. Nevertheless, the ruling
was viewed as a victory by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which had
filed a brief in favor of Arriba. "Web site owners can rest a bit easier
about linking to copyrighted materials online," said an EFF staff attorney.
"By revising its ruling, the court removed a copyright iceberg from the
main shipping lanes of the World Wide Web." (CNet News.com 7 Jul 2003)

COMING TO A COMPUTER SCREEN NEAR YOU -- TV COMMERCIALS
Advertisers are putting their TV spots online, spurred by a combination of
better technology, the spread of broadband and the failure of other online
advertising formats. And while ad agencies are enthusiastic about the
trend, analysts note that advertisers risk sparking a backlash among Web
surfers already irritated by intrusive pop-up ads. "In the television world
we've seen consumers become more and more frustrated with commercials. If
you're going to start providing that kind of advertising technology on the
Web, it's going to result in the same response from consumers," says a
Yankee Group analyst. Currently, "rich media" ads make up a small portion
of the $6-billion online advertising market, but the category grew last
year to 5% from 2% in 2001 and further growth is expected this year. "It's
minute compared to television. But, given the trends we're seeing, it won't
be minute two or three years from now." (Wall Street Journal 8 Jul 2003)

EFF BACKS FILE SWAPPERS, ATTACKS RIAA
Responding to the recent announcement from the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) about plans for lawsuits against
individuals, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has launched a
campaign to mobilize the estimated 60 million Americans who use
file-sharing services. The goal of the "Let the Music Play" campaign is
to make changes in current copyright law to legalize file sharing while
guaranteeing that artists will be compensated for their work. According
to Shari Steele of the EFF, "copyright law is out of step with the
views of the American public and the reality of music distribution
online." The EFF has suggested instituting licensing fees, paid by
manufacturers of MP3s and CD-ROMs. The fees would be doled out to
artists based on usage. The RIAA dismissed the idea as one that would
favor retransmission services and stifle innovation.

RIAA WARNING BOOSTS SWAPPING
Representatives of Grokster and Morpheus said file-trading activity on
their services has increased by about 10 percent in recent days, not
long after the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)
announced it would begin locating and prosecuting individual file
sharers. Some speculated the increase is a response to what many file
traders consider unreasonable action by the recording industry, while
others thought the rise suggests that many users see the RIAA's threat
as the "last call" to get music for free. Michael Weiss of Streamcast,
the company that developed Morpheus, said, "Any time you get media
attention, you get people interested to try it out." A spokesperson from
the RIAA declined to discuss the recent increase in file-trading activity.

KAZAA'S ANTITRUST SUIT THROWN OUT
A federal judge has thrown out a suit brought by Sharman Networks,
which distributes the Kazaa file-trading software, against recording
and film companies for what it said were antitrust violations. Sharman
argued that the entertainment industry was using its position to
prevent authorized copies from being traded on Kazaa. Judge Stephen V.
Wilson threw out the suit, however, saying that even if record and film
companies were guilty of using collective power unfairly, Sharman would
not be hurt because it is not in competition with them. Wilson had
previously ruled that developers of file-sharing technologies are not
responsible for illegal uses of those networks.

MICROSOFT CHANGES LICENSING TERMS
To comply with parts of the government's antitrust settlement against
Microsoft, the company has changed the terms under which other
companies can license technology that allows Windows applications to
communicate with servers. Formerly, companies that wanted to license
the technology were required to sign a nondisclosure agreement even to
read the licensing terms, and licensees were prohibited from suing
Microsoft. Another aspect of the old terms discouraged prospective
licensees involved with Linux. These restrictions have been dropped in
what a Microsoft spokesman described as a "unique and unprecedented"
licensing program. Despite the new licensing terms, a recent court
filing indicates that some states remain concerned about some of
Microsoft's actions. Those issues will be discussed at a judicial
hearing later this month.

PLANNED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM RAISES EYEBROWS
A new surveillance system being developed by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency has some scientists and civil libertarians
concerned about potential civilian uses of the system. The Combat Zones
That See project is intended to use software to analyze images from
many thousands of cameras in an urban setting to identify cars, license
plates, and even passengers. The goal is to protect U.S. forces in
urban settings by spotting license plates on watch lists or discerning
suspicious behavior. Despite assurances from the Pentagon that the
technology is intended only for military uses, some observers have
expressed concern that it could be used by civilian law enforcement
agencies in a manner that intrudes on personal privacy. John Pike of
GlobalSecurity.org said, "Government would have a reasonably good idea
of where everyone is most of the time."

[Of Course, It's Not What We Usually Call Spam. . . .]

COURT RULES AGAINST INTEL IN E-MAIL TRESPASS CASE
The California Supreme Court ruled that a former Intel employee did not
violate trespassing laws when he sent e-mail messages to current Intel
employees. From 1996 to 1998, Kenneth Hamidi, a former Intel engineer
who was fired after a workers' compensation dispute, sent six e-mail
messages to Intel employees, directing them to a Web site he created
that criticized Intel. In 1998, Intel received an injunction that
barred Hamidi from sending messages to Intel employees. The California
court overturned the lower court's injunction and rejected Intel's
argument that the messages represented illegal trespassing to its
computer systems. The trespass argument has been used by Internet
service providers and companies to stop spam. Jeffrey D. Neuburger, a
New York-based technology lawyer, said, "Everyone is trying to figure
out ways to solve the spam problem, and this ruling doesn't help."
Although the case attracted attention regarding free-speech and
employee rights, the California court ruled only on the trespass issue.
