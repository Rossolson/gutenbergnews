REVIEWS/RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PG e-TEXTS WANTED

Due to the incredible success of the "Trench on Words" review
[https://www.gutenbergnews.org/content/view/176/42/], which went straight into the
Top-Ten of our "Most Popular" listings, we'd like to encourage more reviews and
commentary materials on Project Gutenberg. If you know of any public domain
reviews or if you wish to write your own review/recommendation on any of the
e-texts in the collection then please contact editor@gutenbergnews.org.


THE MEDIEVAL HELPDESK: A YOUTUBE VIDEO

A short movie on YouTube that is getting millions of hits, and is a total riot!


Just a short note on how the video about "The Medieval Helpdesk" got here.

As with so many people, I had played with YouTube once a month or so to do a
little searching for certain things and look over the hot lists, but the major
YouTube experience had pretty much eluded me, that is, until my Mom, who is
turning 95 shortly, sent me The Medieval Helpdesk. I loved it much and
forwarded it to a few dozen friends, who then forwarded it on and on-- and it
just kept going.  The result, I am now an official YouTube member-- but all
the names I tried based on my own name were taken, so. . .I am now
JohannesGutenberg on YouTube, and hope to be uploading in a few months. ;-)

Thanks Mom!!!
Michael Hart

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
