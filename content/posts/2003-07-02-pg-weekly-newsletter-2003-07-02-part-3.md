eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Since 1971

Part 3

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:  GUTINDEX Has Moved to Five Digits!

As we have recently posted our first eBook with a five digit eBook number
(#10701), we have made an adjustment to the GUTINDEXes to accomodate this
change. Basically, the alignment of eBook numbers less than 10,000 have
been moved one space to the right.  This change is also reflected in the
eBook listings below.


=============================================================================
=           [ Here Are The Updated Listings For This Past Week ]            =
=============================================================================

TOTAL COUNT as of today, Wed 02 Jul 2003:   8,411 (incl. 242 Aus.).

Last week the Total Count was 8,352, including 241 at PG of Australia.
This week we added 59 new (incl. 2 at PG of Australia).

RESERVED count:   39

=-=-=-=[ CORRECTIONS, REVISIONS AND NEW FORMATS ]=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, xxxxx11.txt, and
    prior to 1998, occasionally a new eBook number.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, xxxxx10a.txt, as
    well as a new eBook number.

--Please note the following changes, corrections and improvements:

As David Price, in Merry Old England (sometimes wet, sometimes not),
pointed out to your GUTINDEXer:  "Schroeder is listed but Lossing is
missing."  To correct that oversite, the following is being re-indexed
to add supplemental author info:

(My apologies, but David's words just had a nice lilt to them, and I had
  an overwhelming compulsion to include them here.  I can't promise it
  won't happen again.)

info, also re-posted in a new format as indicated:
