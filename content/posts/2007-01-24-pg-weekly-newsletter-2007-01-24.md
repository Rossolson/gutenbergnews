                   2007, THE YEAR OF THE CELL PHONE [extract]
                               by Michael Hart

A Review of the new LG eNV and Apple iPhone, and more.

You think you've seen cell phones?
Not the kind that you'll be seeing sooner than you think!

2007 will see the start of cell phones that do everything we can imagine, and
perhaps more than many of us imagine.

Many of you have heard me talk about convergence of function away from
dedicated devices for years, if not decades, since the behemoth Wang word
processors that couldn't compete well against WordStar, WordPerfect, etc.

"The Future Is Now"

You'll see a bigger change in cell phones now than ever, and it will continue
for the next two or three years.

                WHAT IF EVERYONE COULD HAVE EVERYTHING? [extract]
                               by Michael Hart

This is not simply a rhetorical question, particularly in the middle of The
Computer Revolution, so let's try to first consider the kinds of things that
may live in your computer, and thus in anyone else's.

And thus in anyone else's....
There's the key to the whole situation.

Before computers there was ONLY ONE THING everyone all over the world could
have all they wanted of....Don't know?

Read on to find out.

NOTES:

At the start of 2007, the PG-US total had been adjusted (by -350 eBooks) to
take into consideration the duplications from PG-EU. Please remember that
other totals may also have been affected.
This figure (-350) is only approximate, we will update once we have received
the exact figure from PG-EU.

We have several counting methods that often differ by several books. There
is also some duplication between the various collections. Volunteers will
need to take these duplications into account.

The PG Australia total does NOT include PGAU eBooks posted at the U.S.
website; www.gutenberg.org.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire collections to fully
appear in the PrePrints Section, thus the count sometimes jumps by a large
number when the files are eventually completed and added in. Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move later to other
locations, including the main collection or The Project Gutenberg Consortia
Center, etc. For example, on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks
appeared, and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send them to the
PrePrints Section took well over a month.
Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section, it still takes a
certain amount of time to collect and put such a large collection online in a
proper manner.
