.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

  http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the world,
and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on the search
results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest
to you, visit:

  http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

EBooks numbered 1 to 10000 are located in "release year" directories.
Over time, the "release year" advanced, so that by November 2003 the
release year was 2006.  Starting with eBook #10001, they are filed by
their official eBook number, with a unique subdirectory based on that
eBook number.

FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000

To get to a directory listing you can use either:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/

Then navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the
appropriate level, and then select the file you wish to download,
using your usual download procedures.  This system works on mirrors,
too, and will hold all eBooks starting with the number "1" for
10,000 and beyond.


FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000:

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download site
(or a mirror) if you know the filename and year you want.  For example,
navigate to either:

  http://gutenberg.net/etext06/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/

and then look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that
updated eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99,
etext00, etc.)

                     ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

     Note:  this listing best viewed with a fixed-width font, such as
            Courier New or similar.
