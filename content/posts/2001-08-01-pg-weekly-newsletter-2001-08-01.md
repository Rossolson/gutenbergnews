OUR ONLY PAID JOB IS OPENING UP. . .APPLICATION INFO BELOW

Please put Project Gutenberg on your Christmas list now. . . .

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation wants to put me under
contract, which would be nice, as my gross income for the past ~32 months
has been $1250. . .no kidding. . .but they can't do this without some $$$.
If you can keep us running until the end of this year, they want me to be
primarily into fundraising and public relations, since I am the only one
willing to do that sort of thing, and we have finally found at least one
more volunteer than Greg Newby who is willing to post Etext when I am gone.

As of July 12, 2001 contributions are only being solicited from people in:
Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia,
Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 501(c)(3)
organization with EIN [Employee Identification Number] 64-6221541

We STILL need a volunteer in North Dakota to be our legal presence there.
No reply from last request. . .please ask your North Dakotan friends.

We need people in the following countries to handle "life +50" books,
such as 1984 and Animal Farm, by George Orwell, and more. . . .
We are hoping some people in these countries will make Etext sites.
WARNING!!!  Canada is hiding it, but they are contemplating moving
to "life +70". . .so if you want to get these and pass them on in
a legal manner. . .now is the time!!!  We have a site starting up
in Australia, so let me know if you would like to help it start!

Someone sent me a beautifully marginated message outlining some
proposals to work with Project Gutenberg Etexts, and I have not
been able to find the message again to reply. . .please resend!

VIVENDI AND AOL CHARGED WITH CD PRICE-FIXING
The Federal Trade Commission has accused Warner Music (a unit of AOL Time
Warner) and PolyGram (now a part of Vivendi) of colluding in 1998 to fix
prices on CDs, cassettes and videos of opera singers Placido Domingo,
Luciano Pavarotti, and Jose Carreras, knowns as "The Three Tenors." Neither
company has admitted wrong-doing, but AOL has settled the case and Warner
"has made the business decision to resolve this matter amicably rather than
engage in protracted adversarial proceedings." (Washington Post 1 Aug 2001)
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12775-2001Jul31.html

FACE-OFF: SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS VS. PRIVACY ADVOCATES
U.S. federal agencies have committed millions of dollars to the improvement
of facial-identification systems that lets cameras scan faces in a crowd and
automatically compare them to stored images. An example of this technology
is the FaceIt system (developed by Visionics), which has been used in Israel
to manage the flow of individuals entering and exiting the Gaza strip and in
Tampa, Florida to taking photos of individuals walking in an entertainment
district and matching the photos with digital mug shots of known criminals.
The Visionics system and systems developed by its competitors have been
funded by such agencies as DARPA, NSA, and the U.S. Justice Department.
George Washington University law professor Jeffrey Rosen, a privacy advocate
who is critical of these developments, warns: "America now faces a choice
about how far we want to go down the road to being a surveillance society."

VOICE CLONING
AT&T Labs has created new text-to-voice software that makes it possible for
a company to use recordings of a person's voice (for example, John F.
Kennedy's) to utter life-like statements that they never made. Priced in the
thousands of dollars and called "Natural Voices," the software could be used
by telephone call centers and other such activities. An AT&T executive said:
"If ABC wanted to use Regis Philbin's voice for all of its automated
customer-service calls, it could." Issues sure to arise include disputes
over voice-licensing rights and measures to prevent fraudulent uses. One
potential client for the software noted: "Just like you can't trust a
photography anymore, you won't be able to trust a voice either." (New York
Times 31 Jul 2001)

BMG TO TEST PROTECTIVE CDs
Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment is testing a new type of compact disc that
enables consumers to make a limited number of digital copies, but prevents
unlimited "ripping" of songs. Listeners can e-mail songs to others, but the
recipients will have to pay a fee to listen to them. The CDs use technology
from SunnComm, based in Phoenix, Ariz. BMG's test is the latest sign that
the era of free music is drawing to a close. (Wall Street Journal 31 Jul

"FREE DMITRY" PROTESTS CONTINUE
About a hundred protesters showed up yesterday in San Francisco to denounce
the arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov, who the government has
accused of violating the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The
charge was based on Sklyarov's role in the development of software used to
evade copyright protections used on Adobe eBook software. An attorney for
the Electronic Freedom Foundation told the gathering of Sklyarov supporters
that the long-standing "Fair Use" principle of copyright law "allows people
to make use of things freely without the permission of the copyright
holder." One protester said: "I'm interested in freedom of speech and trying
to redress the balance between copyright holders to control information and
the lack of the individual's right to challenge that." (Reuters/San Jose

MICROSOFT SET TO BLOCK AOL-AT&T CABLE DEAL
Microsoft is preparing to flex its financial muscle to block AOL Time
Warner's bid for AT&T Broadband by encouraging alternative bids for the No.
1 U.S. cable operator. With its cash pile of more than $50bn, Microsoft
could afford to make its own overtures, but the company insists it's not
interested in entering the cable business directly. Instead, Microsoft
likely will make further investments in other cable operators. At issue is
the software maker's determination to prevent a merger that would create an
industry giant with about 29 million subscribers, or about 40% of the U.S.
market, and would give AOL control over one of the most promising means of
delivering advanced Internet services to U.S. consumers. (Financial Times

[Will this happen with computers???]

REPLACEMENT PHONES TO DRIVE CELL PHONE MARKET
China's vast wireless market is coveted by handset makers, but it won't
revive the sector, says First Union Securities analyst Mark Roberts. "It's
not the new subscriber globally that is going to drive the industry. It is
the replacement market." According to UBS Warburg, more than half the cell
phones sold this year will be replacement models, not new purchases. And
that trend is set to continue -- in 2002, 75% of handset sales will be
replacements. Analyst say that while China boasts hundreds of millions of
potential customers, most of them are poor. "They can sell millions (of
handsets), but they'd have to sell them cheap. It's really a gray market
for unsold, surplus handsets from Europe," says Matt Finick, an analyst
with Thomas Weisel Partners. In contrast, the next-generation handsets
needed for European and U.S. wireless data services can cost $100 and up,
providing manufacturers with healthy profit margins. (Investor's Business

WHO WILL BUY? AND WHY?
Although the personal computer industry has been engaged in a price war and
the price of a 1-GHz Pentium III system has fallen to about $700, sales are
lagging, and research firm Gartner Dataquest thinks the reason is simply
that, for most people, the computers they already own are fast enough. One
glimmer of hope for the industry is that the October release of Microsoft's
new Windows XP operating system will prompt people to decide that it's
easier just to buy a new system than to worry that an existing system might
be growing obsolete. (AP/Washington Post 30 Jul 2001)

CONGRESS AGAINST CARNIVORE
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill that would require
federal law-enforcement officials to provide a detailed accounting each
year of how they made use of the system known as Carnivore (renamed DCS
1000), which allows criminal investigators with a search warrant to monitor
the e-mail traffic to and from a suspect's computer. The FBI would be
called on to reveal which officials and which courts authorized its use,
which specific laws were invoked to justify its use, and what benefits were
gained from that use. (Reuters/USA Today 25 Jul 2001)

LINUX TAKES ON BIG JOBS
The Linux operating system is being used for more and more
mission-critical business applications. Last week, Korean Air
announced that its flight crew scheduling and daily revenue
accounting systems were being moved to Linux. Linux has been
running Newell Rubbermaid's Multi Router Traffic Grapher on its
mainframe for almost a year. Winnebago Industries saved 70
percent of its software licensing costs for e-mail by using
Linux operating on an IBM mainframe. Mainframe Linux has been
downloaded from the Web roughly 3,000 times, and 10 of those
downloads are running mission-critical systems, said Giga
Information Group analyst David Mastrobattista.

CONGRESS NOT LIKELY TO CHANGE DMCA
While programmers, technologists, and consumer advocates rail
against the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), insiders
believe that there is little chance of changing the law.
Approved unanimously in both the House and Senate in 1998, the
DMCA has received continued support from Congress and its
corporate lobbyists. Leaders of the technology and intellectual
property rights committees on both sides of Congress say they
approve of the law in its current form. Legal challenges to the
law, including free speech arguments, have not fared well either,
as shown in the case of the recording industry against the online
magazine 2600, which failed in a bid to publish code that can
unscramble DVD copy protection. Currently, many opposed to the
DMCA in its current form are in an uproar over the arrest of a
Russian programmer accused of creating and disseminating software
to circumvent file-copying protections on e-books. Although
Adobe, the software firm that first sought the programmer's
arrest, has since reversed its calls for prosecution, observers
say the government is likely to press forward with its case.

PIRACY BATTLE HITTING HOME
The Fair Use provision of the copyright law give users the
right to quote or reference the intellectual property of others.
Based on this, Raymond Kim, who owns a laptop and two desktop
computers, said he should be allowed to share the software among
his family's machines rather than buy three programs. Most in
the software industry do not agree. For example, Microsoft plans
to allow consumers one standard installation of Office XP and one
backup copy; the software will shut down after 50 uses if the
program is not registered after installation. On the other hand,
Adobe takes a lax attitude toward consumers installing one piece
of software on other computers in their home.

SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT FUND ONLINE CONTENT?
Former PBS President Lawrence K. Grossman and former FCC Chief
Newton N. Minow argue that the federal government should become
more involved in bridging the digital divide by providing online
public space to supplement their efforts to Web-enable schools
and communities. With this end in mind, Grossman and Minow have
formed the Digital Promise Project, an organization dedicated
to the provision of educational and civic-centered Web content
through initiatives such as the Digital Opportunity Investment
Trust. The project would support the implementation of online
libraries and museum collections, as well as programs to help
teachers learn how to take full advantage of technology in their
classrooms. The Digital Promise group suggests that funding
could be acquired from electromagnetic spectrum auctions, but
they would not be the only agency vying for such revenues. The
promise of public sites uncluttered by marketing is a worthy
goal, said Grossman. "You could have a virtual solar system,
a 3D model of a human body, or a recreation of Mark Twain's America."
