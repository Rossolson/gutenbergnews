The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended our production year.

With 5,439 eTexts online as of June 26, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.84 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.79 when we had 3589 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.95 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

BUY.COM PROMISES LOWER PRICES THAN AMAZON
Buy.com, which already prices many of its books below those sold by Amazon,
says it will now guarantee all books will be marked 10% below the same
merchandise sold on the Amazon site. The challenge comes just a week after
Buy.com announced it was offering free shipping on most items in its store,
with no minimum purchase required. The move was aimed directly at
undercutting Amazon's policy of offering free shipping on orders totaling
at least $49. "Amazon has 25 million customers, we have 5 million," says
Buy.com president Robert Price. "We want to go after a place where we know
the customers are at." Buy.com COO Brent Rusick says his company is able to
offer lower prices because it doesn't hold any inventory and doesn't have
to maintain warehouses. Instead, all of Buy.com's books are drop-shipped
from distributors such as Ingram Books. "We feel we have fundamentally a
better cost structure than they do," says Rusick. (CNet News.com 24 Jun 2002)

FBI HAS BEEN VISITING LIBRARIES
The FBI has been visiting libraries nationwide to check the reading records
of persons suspected of plotting against the U.S. The visits are conducted
under the auspices of the Patriot Act, which Congress passed last fall
after the September 11 attacks, and which requires that the FBI first
obtain a court-ordered search warrant. Judith Krug of the American Library
because these records and this information can be had with so little reason
or explanation. It's super secret and anyone who wants to talk about what
the FBI did at their library faces prosecution. That has nothing to do with
patriotism." She advises librarians to keep only the records they need and
to discard records that show which patron checked out a book and for how
long. (AP/Washington Post  24 Jun 2002)

SHOW-DOWN IN BUCHAREST
At its annual meeting in Bucharest this week the nonprofit organization
ICANN, which stands for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, will be facing its fiercest critics and defending its recent
proposal to limit ICANN board membership to representatives of business and
government. Long-time ICANN critic and University of Miami law professor
time are they organized in a manner that would make their representation
easy. The officials who turn up to ICANN meetings are the ones who heard
about the Internet first, not necessarily the people who make, or should
make, Internet policy.'' (Reuters/San Jose Mercury-News 25 Jun 2002)

BROADBAND DEMAND BUILDING
Americans are jumping on the broadband wagon, with one in five of all Web
users now using a high-speed connection at home -- quadruple the number of
broadband users just two years ago, according to a recent survey by the Pew
Internet and American Life Project. "This places broadband adoption rates
on par with the adoption of other popular technologies, such as the
personal computer and the compact disc player, and faster than color TV and
the VCR," says the report. Pew found that the average broadband user does
seven online tasks or activities per day, compared with about three among
dialup access users. All that extra time comes at the expense of other
they were shopping less, and 18% said they'd cut down on their newspaper
reading time. Most of the respondents -- 71% -- accessed their broadband
service via cable TV modem. Twenty-seven percent used DSL service and 2%
used satellite or wireless broadband services. (AP 24 Jun 2002)

THE FUTURE OF TRANSLATION?
Some researchers are predicting that the breadth of content on the Web will
provide the basis for new translation services. Eduard Hovy of the
University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute
and probably already translated on the Web." If that's true, the
translation problem is largely reduced to finding and identifying examples,
so that the main rules are not syntactical ones but semantic ones (of the
sort in which the computer can make context-sensitive deductions -- such as
deciding that when the word "bank" is close to the word "account" it refers
to a financial institution rather than to the bank of a river). However,
Hovy and his group have apparently concluded that the mining of the Web is
best-suited not for developing translations directly but rather for
deciding between alternative translations offered by more traditional
rule-based translation software. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 23 Jun 2002)

WEB RADIO ROYALTY RATE CUT IN HALF
Librarian of Congress James H. Billington has reduced the proposed royalty
rate to be paid by Internet-only radio stations to 0.07 cents per song per
listener -- half of the rate proposed by arbitrators last February. The
rate now matches that proposed for traditional radio stations that also put
their broadcasts on the Web. It will remain in effect only until the end of
this year, when a new, as-yet-undetermined rate is supposed to take effect.
The new, reduced rate came under fire from both sides, with Webcasters
complaining it was still too high, and the Recording Industry Association
of America arguing that it meant that "artists and record labels will
subsidize the Webcasting businesses" of big Internet and radio companies,
and that the fee "simply does not reflect the fair market value of the
music as promised by the law." On the other side of the issue, the National
Association of Broadcasters said the rate "places a prohibitive financial
burden on radio-station streaming and will likely result in the termination
of this fledgling service to listeners." (Wall Street Journal 21 Jun 2002)

CELL PHONES OUTNUMBER PEOPLE IN TAIWAN
The rate of mobile phone ownership in Taiwan is 100.7%, says a new
government report, which noted that the number of cell phone users in that
country has jumped from 2 million to 22.6 million in just four years. In
many Taiwanese households, families have two or three cell phones, and some
people carry separate handsets for business communications and for keeping
in touch with friends and family. (Ananova 20 Jun 2002)

STATES SAY 'SHOW US THE CODE!'
Steven Kuney, the lead attorney for the nine states still in litigation
against Microsoft, said yesterday in closing arguments that requiring
Microsoft to disclose software interfaces -- which would allow competitors
to write programs that interoperate smoothly with Windows -- is the No. 1
remedy desired by the states. The statement followed an unusual pre-hearing
order by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly asking both sides to list the
penalties they deemed most important -- or most odious. Surprisingly, the
disclosure of code was ranked more important to the states than some of the
more controversial parts of their proposed penalties, including forcing
Microsoft to license a stripped-down version of Windows to competitors. The
judge's order came as a first sign that she may be seeking a compromise of
penalties that accommodates some of the demands set out by the states in
addition to the more lenient remedies included in Microsoft's settlement
with the Justice Department. Resolving the two lawsuits with one set of
penalties would take Kollar-Kotelly into uncharted legal territory, and is
opposed by the Justice Department, which has argued that as the prosecutor
of nationwide antitrust laws, its authority should be given deference.

FEDS LAUNCH INVESTIGATION OF DRAM CHIPMAKERS
The U.S. Justice Department is looking into allegations of price collusion
among makers of DRAM memory chips, and has issued subpoenas to Micron
Technology, Samsung Electronics, Hynix Semiconductor and Infineon
Technologies, among others. Following industry consolidation in the past
couple of years, when a number of U.S. and Japanese chipmakers dropped out
of the market due to stiff competition and low profit margins, prices shot
up from an average of $1.97 in the fourth quarter of 2001 to $4.50 in the
first quarter of this year -- a price spike that quickly alarmed computer
makers. Dell Computer founder Michael Dell alleged at an investor
conference in April that the price increases resulted from "cartel-like
behavior by a couple DRAM suppliers." Memory-chip executives and many
analysts have disputed that interpretation, noting that the DRAM business
is "highly competitive and subject to extreme volatility." Meanwhile, the
Federal Trade Commission has filed a civil complaint against Rambus,
accusing it of coercing other chipmakers into adopting technical standards
for which it already held or was seeking patents. The government says
Rambus's efforts to charge royalties have raised prices for the memory chip
industry and shaken their faith in standards-setting bodies.

Headlines From Edupage:

UNIVERSITIES LOSE MONEY TO STUDENT CELL PHONES
In the days of wired phone systems, many universities set up their own
telephone switchboards, acting as wholesalers for the student phone
market. Universities could run their own phone systems, charging
slightly more than they pay but less than local phone companies for
landline service to students. With more and more students choosing cell
phones over wired services, some universities are losing large amounts
of money. In the last two years, for example, the University of
California, Santa Barbara, has lost $500,000. Chico State's loss for
last year was $400,000. Some predict higher tuition rates to cover the
losses. Campuses including American University in Washington, D.C., and
the University of Southern Mississippi have opted to eliminate wired
phone service and instead equip all students with cell phones and
handheld computers.   Associated Press, 24 June 2002

SOFTWARE SEARCHES FOR ILLEGAL MOVIES
A software program called Ranger searches Web sites, chat rooms,
newsgroups, and peer-to-peer file-sharing sites for illegal movies on
behalf of film studios represented by the Motion Picture Association of
America. Ranger covers 60 countries, searching in English, Chinese, and
Korean for pirate movie sites.  Some of its targets object to the
software's findings, however.  Internetmovies.com has filed suit
against the MPAA because Ranger identified its Web site as a movie
pirate in 2001, prompting the company's Internet service provider to
stop access.   Washington Post, 18 June 2002
