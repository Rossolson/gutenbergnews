The big news this month is that [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org "Project Gutenberg website") has officially passed **30,000** original eBooks, bringing the the original Project Gutenberg editions to as many titles as the average U.S. public library.

<pre>27,188  (+212)  11/20/08 - PG General Automated Count
 1,717  (+ 11)  11/18/08 - PG Australia
   542  (+ 12)  10/21/08 - PG Europe
 2,461  (+  0)  10/21/08 - PG PrePrints
   190  (+ 13)  11/09/08 - PG Canada

32,098  (+348) by various automated counts and newsletters</pre>

Another major landmark is that the number of books in the Chinese language has now passed Dutch to become the newest member of Project Gutenberg's "Top 5 Languages", with a total of over 375 books in the Gutenberg archives.

There are still around 300 Chinese titles being held on the PrePrint site so we really need help in cataloging these. If you can work in Chinese you are encouraged to look into the [directory called /china over at PrePrints](http://preprints.readingroo.ms/china "Chinse books at PrePrints"), or get the .zip file (one directory above) to downloaded all the files in one go.

Here's an update on the languages (NOT counting the new 307 PrePrints);

  * 23075 English (EN)
  * 1319 French (FR)
  * 553 German (DE)
  * 476 Finnish (FI)
  * 377 Chinese (ZH)
  * 361 Dutch (NL)
  * 267 Portuguese (PT)
  * 217 Spanish (ES)
  * 164 Italian (IT)

Spanish is listed as the third language, with regard to its use on the entire Internet, so Michael Hart wants this to be the next goal for Project Gutenberg; bring Spanish in to the Top 5.
