FEATURED NEWS
-------------

SPECULATIVE FICTION, THE EARTH'S NONRENEWABLE RESOURCES

Projecting inferences of realities into a past or a future is a device often
used by writers to portray the 'effects' of prevailing circumstances or
events. Meyer (Mike) Moldeven, a retired civilian logistics analyst for the
U.S. Air Force, chose the distant future as the setting for his e-novel
'The Universe-or Nothing.' The work includes 'References' and an 'Afterwords'
section as context for his speculations.

Mike recently completed an essay 'NONRENEWABLE RESOURCES and SPACEFARING: A
Future History?' to update and expand on the original 'AFTERWORDS' section and
it may be freely downloaded at:

http://hometown.aol.com/yarnspinner88/myhomepage/politics.html

Briefly, in 'THE UNIVERSE-or Nothing' humankind populates the Solar System from
Mercury to beyond Dwarf Planet Pluto. Centuries of wasteful consumption of
essential industrial-base metals, minerals, ores and other nonrenewable
substances has brought the Solar Community to the brink of disaster. Retreat
is unacceptable. Humankind reaches for the stars.

The e-novel may be freely downloaded from the Project Gutenberg Archive
Library at:

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
