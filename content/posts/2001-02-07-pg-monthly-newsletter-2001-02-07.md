With 3000 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.33 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.

*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

With 3150 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.17 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.
*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*


This "cost" is down from $3.23 when we had 3100 Etexts on January 3
This "cost" is down from $3.33 when we had 3000 Etexts on December 6
This "cost" is down from $3.40 when we had 2870 Etexts on October 18/Nov 1
This "cost" is down from $3.48 when we had 2870 Etexts on September 3
This "cost" is down from $3.55 when we had 2820 Etexts on August 16
This "cost" is down from $3.60 when we had 2775 Etexts on August 2
This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2650 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts in April

Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by 83 cents???
Just from one spring to the next winter???  When we complete the July
2002 Etexts, we should have this "cost" down to under $3.00!!!

We are searching for something appropriate for #3333, so please let us
know if you have any suggestions.

It's kind of a minor miracle that we actually have a Newsletter today,
and that it is filled with all the new Project Gutenberg Etexts I have
normally come to expect to be able to hand you on the first Wednesday,
every month for quite a long time.

As many of you may know, prairienet.org, the mainframe I do most of my
work on, while I actually sit here at my antique basement computer, in
large part due to upgrades and a rather prominent local fire, was down
for a significant part of the month, and is still not quite back to an
ordinary situation. . .at least compared to before our last Newsletter
. . .that went out the very hour Prairienet went down for the upgrade.
So, it is only by hook and by crook that we have been able to get done
with all the books, and get them posted on all the usual sites since I
could not do many of the things I have come to depend on. . .not to go
without mentioning the WONDERFUL cooperation from many volunteers, who
sent me files over and over again, helped me change them, etc. because
I couldn't do so in the normal ways.  We have finally figured out some
ways that should make next month easier. . .which is good, since it is
going to be a much shorter month.

Many of the files were actually dated for tomorrow but we actually got
them online today, so I changed the date to today. . .even though some
of them may need some last minute touch-ups before this Newsletter can
be sent out, hopefully in less than 24 hours.  Some of these actually,
and I can still hardly believe it myself, are for May, 2002.

I did manage to finally to catch up with ALL the emails, so if you see
no reply from a message, please resend.  I have also caught up with an
enormous amount of snailmail, so you should have heard from me, unless
you sent me a disk. . .the program that allows me to send files to the
mainframe is still not up. . .but I have finally devised a work-around
by way of sending them to our site at North Carolina first.

As always, people did send me both email and snailmail with addresses,
sadly to say, that either weren't there, or that I could not read, and
some that just didn't work, even with the help of local postmasters.

I will list some of those below, and perhaps you will recognize that I
got your mail and am trying to respond.

Steve Stone &lt;sstone@microsoft.com&gt; said he was General Manager of some
eBook division of MicroSoft, and wanted to talk to me, and I have sent
some three replies by now, but I don't think they got there. . .please
. . .someone who emails MicroSoft regularly. . .see if you can get him
to email me at hart@pobox.com. . .and let me know.

and

We have a copyright clearance for Jeroen. . .but no email address. . .
at least not one that works. . . .

Please include your email address when you send us snailmail. . .!

Subject: Re: Spanish ebooks

I would like to translate the books on the PG to spanish. All of them or at
least the most part. To do that I would organize the workflow sending to the
translators the english books they choose of a list of preselected. Then I'd
receive the spanish version and check it. The more hands we put on the work,
the better.

We need an HTML volunteer to get the HTML versions of Andrew Lang's Fairy

Comments About Our Improved Files

We LOVE for people to proofread ALL our Etexts, and send us list of errors!!!

The easiest way to do proofreading for Project Gutenberg
is simply to read the file and make a list of the errors
you find, and then email them to me, with suggestions...
I would just cut and paste the old line, and then, right
below it, put in your suggestions for the new line.  The
easy ways for me to spot the errors is if you put a ^ on
the next line under them, and/or just stop your lines of
correction at the word needing correction.







From: Michael Lynch &lt;lynchm@johnmarshall.edu&gt;

          I have an interest in the works of Joseph Altsheler, an
author of adventure stories for boys whose works are all public domain.
I am particularly interested in the Young Trailer series (as was Saul
Bellow who refers to two of the characters, Henry Ware and Timendiquas
in The Adventures of Augie March).  One title (Scouts of the Valley)
is already in Gutenberg.  Several others are:
The Young Trailers
The Free Rangers
Forest Runners: A Story of the Great War Trail in Early Kentucky
The Keepers of the Trail
The Border Watch

I can't scan right now, but would be happy to proof read if anyone else can
find and scan the texts.

Notes from News Scan and Edupage

AMAZON TO CHARGE PUBLISHERS FOR ONLINE RECOMMENDATIONS
Amazon recently notified publishers that it will begin charging them as
much as $10,000 per title in exchange for a better chance of having their
books recommended on Amazon's e-mail promotions. Previously, the e-mail
recommendations were based solely on the judgment of Amazon book editors,
and Amazon says it will continue to recommend books through this process as
well, possibly confusing some customers about what are effectively paid
advertisements and what titles were selected purely on editorial merit.
Amazon says it will provide a link on its site that readers can click on to
find which titles were paid for. In addition to the new fee levied if
publishers' nominations are approved by Amazon editors, publishers will be
required to buy promotional ads on Amazon's pages, pushing the total
package to as high as $17,000. Amazon says it plans to reject any
recommendations it does not deem worthy of inclusion. Publishers warned
that Amazon's new policy could backfire: "If you don't distinguish between
editorial and advertorial you could lose credibility," said Laurence
Kirschbaum, CEO of Time Warner Trade Publishing. (Wall Street Journal 7 Feb

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT OKAYS PRIVATE COPYING OF DIGITAL WORKS
The European Parliament has issued a preliminary decision to extend, with
some limitations, the private copying permissible in the analog world to
digital media. New-media companies, consumer-electronics makers and
citizens' rights groups applauded the decision to reject all but 16 of a
record 197 proposed amendments to the EU's Copyright Directive, which faces
a full vote next week. Among the amendments approved was a provision
allowing copyright owners to employ technical protection measures, such as
encryption, to prevent their works from being pirated. Copies could,
however, be made "by a natural person for private use and for ends that are
neither directly nor indirectly commercial." Fair practice lobbyists said       You have been reading excerpts from NewsScan Daily

E-MAIL WIRETAPS
The University of Denver-based Privacy Foundation has begun calling
attention to a new method of privacy invasion that allows someone to listen
in on e-mail discussions. It can be defeated by disabling the Java
programming language in Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, or Netscape 6
mail, and it doesn't affect people who use Eudora, America Online e-mail,
or Web-based e-mail programs such as Hotmail or Yahoo Mail. Microsoft says
the latest version of Outlook Express is not affected and Netscape says it
will soon release a software patch that will eliminate the problem.

XEROX ASSETS UP FOR SALE
Facing a debt of $16.4 billion ($2.7 billion due this year) and with only
$1.4 billion cash on hand, the Xerox Corporation has begun talking with
leveraged-buyout firms to explore the possibilities for selling off some if
not all of the company's assets. Industry analysts are skeptical of Xerox's
ability to find a buyer willing to assume a debt burden of such magnitude.

ACLU UPSET ABOUT HIGH-TECH SURVEILLANCE AT SUPER BOWL
The American Civil Liberties Union has written to Tampa, Florida's mayor
protesting the surveillance procedures used by Tampa's police department at
last week's Super Bowl football game. In attempt to identify any well-known
criminals or terrorists in the stadium, the police set up hidden video
cameras that took pictures of thousands of fans and transmitted the images
to computers at a central command post for comparison with file
photographs. In the letter, ACLU executive Howard Simon wrote: "The ACLU
believes this activity raises serious concerns about the Fourth Amendment
right of all citizens to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures,"
Simon wrote to Tampa Mayor Dick Greco. "Aside from the constitutional
issues raised by the developing use of surveillance technology, we believe
the public should be given an opportunity to ask -- and have answered --
the many questions raised by this practice." (USA Today 2 Feb 2001)

BELLSOUTH HANGS UP ON PAY PHONES
BellSouth has decided to try to sell its 143,000 pay phones, because their
usage has "decreased dramatically" due to the rapidly growing phenomenon of
wireless communications. It's unlikely that the company will get much money
for them, because they are dispersed over the entire region served by
BellSouth, rather than concentrated in high-volume locations, and because
industry analysts such as Jeff Kagan see their future extending for just a
few more years: "The future pay phone will have keyboards and touch screens
and will let people access their e-mail and voice mail boxes and access
other Web-based information. That will give the pay phone business a few
more years of viability, but ultimately, devices that make calls and send
e-mail will be cheap enough for everyone to carry one." (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution 3 Feb 2001)
