 The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter, Sep. 21, 2008
 ****eBooks Readable by Both Humans and Computers since July 4, 1971****

http://www.gutenberg.org

NOTE: Best viewed with a fixed-width font, e.g. Courier New.
      Windows Notepad is a good a program to use for viewing.



51 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring on December 21, 2012
[some now say October 11, 2011]

This leaves 4 1/4 years, 17 seasons, or 51 months.

Not to worry.  I will still make predictions further on.



New Project Gutenberg Landmarks


30,000 eBooks:  About The Same As Average Public Libraries!

We are rapidly approaching 30,000 eBooks in the originating Project Gutenberg
collections, as differentiated from those eBooks originating with other eBook
producers located at an alternate site to the original
http://www.gutenberg.org, at http://www.gutenberg.cc which has over 75,000
eBooks.

We should pass 30,000 before the end of the year, as below.



Chinese Moves Into The Project Gutenberg "Top 5"


We still need more help in cataloging these eBooks, but the latest 300 or so
Chinese eBooks are now in PrePrints.

Anyone who can work in Chinese is encouraged to look into a directory called
/china in PrePrints, or get the .zip file, from one directory above to get all
the files downloaded in one single command.

http://preprints.readingroo.ms

first one on the list:

/china

.zip of whole bunch is one directory up, get china.zip

The current list, before uploaded these appeared as:

Grand total for today: 26545

22647     English en
  1243     French  fr
   542     German  de
   464     Finnish fi
   357     Dutch   nl
   320     Chinese zh
   252     Portuguese      pt
   201     Spanish es
   155     Italian it

When we get all 307 possible titles online, that will bring Chinese up to a
total of 627, which will place it second of our non-English languages
collection which is approximately where it should go, given Internet language
dispersal.

Believe it or not, Spanish is listed as the third language, so that's the next
goal, to bring Spanish to the "Top 5."

In reference to that goal, I am giving a presentation for a new combination of
Internet efforts called "Both Americas,"
in Buenos Aires early next Spring, followed by what I would hope will be
similar conferences in France and India.




All Time Hottest Request

Looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were Disgo/Dizgo, M-Systems and these were OEMed
by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular in a recognizable fashion because their
snapon connectors resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.



Requesting A Second Time


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.



Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and totals from PG of
Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at:

http://www.gutenberg.cc

Where there are eBooks representing over 100 languages.


These are the various totals from the ~30,000 at:

http://www.gutenberg.org

and our other Project Gutenberg Sites
