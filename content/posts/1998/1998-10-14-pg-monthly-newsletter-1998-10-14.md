&gt;From Edupage:


WEB PATENTS WEAVE CONFUSION
A federal appellate court ruling in July confirming that computerized
"business methods" can be patented has sparked a wave of patent applications
that electronic commerce proponents fear will amount to "holdups in
cyberspace."  The July case involved a computerized mathematical formula for
apportioning the administrative costs associated with a family of mutual
funds, but by "claiming the computer as part of the invention, you can make
things patentable that weren't patentable before," says a patent attorney in
California.  Skeptics say many of the new patents won't hold up in court,
and will suffer the same fate as the 1993 patent granted to Compton New
Media, protecting a method for combining text, audio and video on a compact
disk.  That patent was revoked in 1994, after critics demonstrated the
technology was already in common use.  "Everyone is under the impression the
Patent Office thoroughly investigates your claims," says a Forrester
Research analyst.  "They really don't."  (Wall Street Journal 9 Oct 98)
[Compton's also tried to TradeMark the term Multimedia. . .a term I had
used in print as early as the late '70's. . .I still have copies. . .]

PCs BREAK $500 PRICE BARRIER
The San Francisco Chronicle reports that newly formed Emachines is
introducing a fully equipped PC, including a monitor, for less than $500.
The $499 eTower sports a 266 MHz Cyrix microprocessor, a 2.1 gigabyte hard
drive, 32 megabytes of memory, a 56K modem, a CD-ROM drive and a 14-inch
monitor.  The same machine can be purchased without the monitor for $399.
"Five hundred dollars is the magic number for opening up the next wave of
adopters in the home," says the company's CEO.  Emachines is a joint venture
of two Korean companies -- TriGem and Korean Data Systems.  The company is
planning to offer several other computers in the next year or so, including
a 300 MHz eTower with monitor for $599, an ultralight notebook for under
$2,000 and an entertainment device for playing games and watching DVD
movies.  (St. Petersburg Times 10 Oct 98)

SHOULD THE NET BE PRIVATIZED?
The organization called Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility has
begun a battle against a Clinton Administration plan that would largely turn
over management of Internet domain names to an as-yet-unformed nonprofit
corporation.  Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, a member of the group,
says the plan is flawed because it gives too much power to a commercially
minded corporation with a potentially self-perpetuating board.  Saying that
such an entity is unlikely to be a strong enough watchdog for privacy, free
speech, due process and other democratic values, Lessig asks:  "If
government doesn't protect those values, who will?"  (AP 10 Oct 98)

COMPUTERS INSTEAD OF CASH ON CAL. STATE CAMPUS
California State University at San Marcos is offering needy students
computers rather than tuition money as part of a new scholarship program.
The students receive a laptop, a set of software and technical training.  If
they graduate, they get to keep the computer.  "We're a very high-tech
university with a lot of low-income students," says the school's
financial-aid director.  "We have been wrestling with a problem of the
'have/have-not.'"  The university requires all students to demonstrate
computer literacy during their first year.  (Chronicle of Higher Education 9
Oct 98)
