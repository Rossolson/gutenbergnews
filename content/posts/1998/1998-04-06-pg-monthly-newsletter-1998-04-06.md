Subject: April Project Gutenberg Volunteer's Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;

This is the Project Gutenberg Volunteers' Newsletter for April


We are hopefully going to be getting a new influx of volunteers
in a few weeks, so I want to get somewhat organized to have the
possibility of finding them people to work with in these areas:


"Raiders of the Lost Art"

This team will be in charge of finding Etexts out there. . .web
sites, ftp sites, etc.  Many of these will be in HTML format in
which some people will have declared they have a copyright so a
team of HTML and unHTML people will have to work closely with a
representative of the Raiders Team to get some or most of these
into Plain Vanilla ASCII Etext format.

If you are at all interested in searching the Net for things or
in unHTML or HTML, please let me know, as we will need you.


We also need volunteers to supervise our new volunteers to make
their startup period as short and painless as possible, from an
introduction to Etext, to file transfer, etc.


We also are working on Etexts in French, German, Portuguese and
Spanish, at the moment, and we hope to have some coming in this
list of languages.


1.  Arabic
2.  Chinese
3.  Danish
4.  Dutch
5.  Esperanto
6.  French
7   German
8.  Greek
9.  Hebrew
10. Hungarian
11. Italian
12. Japanese
13. Korean
14. Latin
15. Lithuanian
16. Polish
17. Portuguese
18. Romanian
19. Russian
20. Slovak
21. Slovene
22. Spanish
23. Valencian [Catalan]

I think you are doing a great thing.

I was overwelmed when I viewed this site.  I am still
too excited to type.  Thank you for this undertaking.
I am an avid reader and do not know where to begin.

I really enjoy your project and I think that it's a wonderful
idea to make literature classics available to large audiences.

Thanks for the quick response.  I downloaded it from
an ftp mirror site.  All very smooth.  I admire your work.

April-May newsletter just arrived and I would like to express how much I
and some of my friends here in Istanbul  appreciate your efforts which have
brought the Project Gutenberg in present situation. As one of the most
benefited netizens from Gutenberg, I feel I owe something to it. I do not
know what can I do contribute this project but I have a simple flatbed
scanner and OCR software. I would like to do something, if I knew the legal
(royalty and copyright) situation for the books to be carried into
electronic environment. I thought perhaps you can recommend me a URL which
describes it in details or perhaps there is a document about it somewhere
on the net.

Again, thanks for helping us to have outstanding electronic libraries on
our computers.


I fully support this project and the importance
of what is being accomplished. Bravo to you all!!

My admiration and good wishes.

I am blind and use a screen reading program to access Windows 95, Netscape
etc.  I teach other blind people to use computers for a living, so I've
been experimenting with a lot of web sites.  This search engine is the
easiest one to use that I have ever come across.  Great work!!!

I'd like to thank you for your work in helping to coordinate the
Gutenberg project.  It is one of the best resources on the web today.

Your project is excellent.

Best of luck with your Gutenberg project - it's a great idea.

This is a small token of my great regard for your project.

What a fabulous project.

Thanks for the great work.

Keep up the good work.

And congratulations on what you have done. It is remarkable...

It is impossible to me list all times that Project Gutenberg was useful
to me. I download so may books that I need that is very difficult to me
list them all. PG is really a excellent and incomparable resource to all
people on the Internet.  So, thanks a lot for all your work!

I have the greatest admiration for what you are doing
to make fine literature available to any and all.
You have added a whole new dimension to preservation
and distribution with impact beyond immagination....
WELL DONE!

I have a very high regard for Project Gutenberg
and deeply appreciate the work that you are doing.

Thanks and good luck with the project.

I have enjoyed Project Gutenberg.  Keep up the good work.

Thanks for all the hard work.

Books on the Net serve many purposes.  One of them is for the use of people
who are unable, for any number of reasons, to get out of house on a regular
basis to shop or to go to their library.  Some never go out at all. This is
truly a blessing for this part of our community. Be well and please continue
your good work.

I really like the concept of making books of all kinds freely available.

I would like to take this opportunity to say "thank you" to you
and all who make PG possible.
I am totally blind.  The one sorrow related to my blindness has
been the problem of actually owning books.  Braille is
wonderful, but it is expensive and bulky, when one can find
books to buy.  Recorded material is easy to store, but often
hard to find for purchase, except for abridged books put out by
commercial companies.
Can you imagine my joy when I discovered PG.  There are my dear
old friends, many dating back to childhood, just waiting for me
to download, and read again and again.  I am a professional
writer, and a teacher of blind children, so you can imagine how
much books mean to me professionally as well as personally.

I greatly appreciate you starting PG, and feel it is probably
the only thing in the computer world that will not only survive,
but will appreciate rather than depreciate with time.

Thanks for hosting this site.  I have
derived good hours of reading from it.

I love the site and what you are doing. Its truly amazing.

I have being quite interested in PG since 5 years ago when I read about it.
Glad to have found your site.

Thanks, and Salutations to you on your noble project,

An hour ago I discovered your work on the Internet ! Just the list of
titles deserves a Million THANKS , I'll take the risk of sounding corny:
I had tears in my eyes by the time I was half through !

I saw a review of your work in Yahoo's Internet Life.
I was quite impressed.

Thanks to all concerned with this wonderful contribution to
our Internet and immortal writers in the public domain.

Thank you very much for the Gutenberg Foundation.

Great site.  I've been looking over the web search engines for months.
Your service and the links on your site are the only places I have
actually found to download literature.  I plan to visit here often.

Obviously your work is an example of the true value
of the technology age.  (But, this you know!)

I have found the Gutenberg Project to have been of enormous worth.
You have helped me find texts in their original form, instead of the
difficult to read and assemble texts found elsewhere on the Internet.
Thanks for all you do, and keep up the good work!

I have been downloading texts for reading from PG for a couple of years now
and I love it.  I have always been intrigued by the low cost, and breadth
of the materials that are becoming more and more available as texts.

Thanks for a great web site!

I admire and fully support your project. Bravo!

Thanks for your help, and keep up the good work.
It is a great site, and a tremendously worthwhile project.

I think it is a GREAT idea!!

First of all: CONGRATULATIONS!!! Ever since I heard about your
project I was very interested and downloaded many of your precious
files and had a good time with them! THANKS FOR THAT!!!

You are doing such great work with the e-texts.

Thanks for all the work you've done!

Wonderful idea, especially, according to the paper,
The Philadelphia Inquirer, your insisting about plain ascii text.

Please keep up the good work.  I have found Project Gutenberg to be
a wonderful and useful idea.  I sincerely hope that the legislation
in the Senate does not get passed to hamper your efforts.

I have told many people about project Gutenberg and
I hope this project continues for many years to come.

I applaud your accomplishments, and admire your initiatives.

Thank you for the Gutenberg Project!!!!!!
Thank you again.  I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to be able to
"look" up a word or definition for myself.  All the best to you.

Just to encourage the great labor you are doing !

I had the pleasure to visit your site/library, and I found it extremely
interesting - my congratulations for the work you've done and still doing.

First of all, I would like to say that I love the Project Gutenburg
archives.  I have downloaded 93 e-texts so far, and I am still
downloading more.  Thank you for providing the texts at no charge.

I have enjoyed some of your books in etext.
Thanks for all your efforts.

Thanks for the work of the Project.

Well this is my first trip to Project Gutenberg and I think that what is
done here is a good thing, and kinda justifies the exsitance of the web
(I know there are a lot more other worth while causes being pursued in the web
but they are over shadowed by other more commercial and perverse activites)
The simple idea is that you people are doing a good deed and keep it up.

I approve wholeheartedly of your efforts.
Thank you and bravo for your project.

Keep up the good work!

I wish you the best and thanks for your efforts.

Thank you for this wonderful asset.

Best wishes for this admirable endeavour.

The Gutenberg Project is a *great* idea!
Thanks for all the work of the team.

Thank you for your wonderful work to date.

First of all I would like to congratulate you for the work you are
developing with Project Gutemberg due to the difficulty it involves.
[From Spanish, I think.  Remember, in many languages is it Gutemberg]

Well, I first found out about the Project Gutenberg a few years ago,
and I've been hooked ever since!  I went from downloading a few files,
to a few dozen files, to a year's worth, etc.  :-)

First, let me congratulate you on Project Gutenberg
and the amazing number of etexts available!
I have only recently been introduced to PG,
and have been madly downloading all the etexts available.
Again, I am astounded at just how much is available!

Good luck with your program!

Thanks for Project Gutenberg!  It's one of the noblest efforts
conceived on the net, and I've long wanted to be a contributor!

Many thanks for an effort that, a thousand years from now, may be remembered
along with Carnegie's philanthropy and the library of Alexandria.

I have been able to reread - thanks to your project, and may I say with
much pleasure, and a deep sense of gratitude - texts that I had never
thought I would be able to relish again in this lifetime!

What a thrilling project!

I appreciate your work.

Keep up the good work.

I have long been a fan of Project Gutenberg.

Thank you for E-Text on the internet.

I have followed your progress for a few years (been on internet
since the foggy past of 1992) and have always thought that it was
one of the best things available.

When I first encountered Project Gutenberg about 5 years ago, I was
mightily impressed and sent in a small contribution.  Now, I am
delighted to see that all is still well.  I shall write about the
copyright situation to my legislator, but most of all, I simply
wanted to go you what a fine thing I think you are doing.

I think Gutenberg is a great project - thanks for all of the work!

Since I first discovered Project Gutenburg, the idea of electronic books
that are free and only take up a minimal amount of disk space has
fascinated me. I have always greatly admired the effort.

Thank you for beginning this breathtakingly ambitous process.

I, like so many others, am terribly impressed with the work
you've done on Prject Guetnberg.  It is a great service.

The Gutenburg Project is excellent.

How great it is that yall are doing this because i have found some books
that are very rare that i just want to read but have not been able to
find any other way.

This site is amazing.

Keep up the good work.
