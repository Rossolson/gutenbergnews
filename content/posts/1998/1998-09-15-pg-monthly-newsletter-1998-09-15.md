Subject: October Project Gutenberg Newsletter [Early Edition]
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
To: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@pobox.com&gt;
Date: Tue, 15 Sep 1998 15:32:16 -0500 (CDT)

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for Wednesday, October 7, 1998
[This issue is being sent half a month early, we are doing wonderfully]
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

***

In the period since our last Newsletter went out only two weeks ago--
the Project Gutenberg volunteers, directors, and myself, have managed
to double our expected production over the past two weeks since a new
Newsletter was sent out with the index of the December Etexts. . . .

We are currently about 100 Etexts ahead of the schedule we started at
the beginning of the year, and if our usual October recruitment of an
assortment of new volunteers is at all successful, we may be capable,
barring unforseen incidents [such as one week's crashes of two of our
major relay points for our directors files] we may be able to get out
enough Etexts this year to do three or four months ahead of schedule.

We hope this will encourage some of you who have considered doing one
of your favorite books for the rest of the world to use and enjoy; if
you can't wait until our semi-annual "Project Gutenberg Needs You" in
two to three weeks, please don't hesitate to contact me now. . . .

My congratulations to all of our volunteers and directors!!!

Well Done!!!

Some of you who have been with Project Gutenberg for years and years,
and there are a few such persons, will recall that we once had a much
more hopeful schedule, and that we are not likely to reach #10,000 by
the end of 2001, unless we achieve some kind of co-operation with the
various other Etext producers around the world, and perhaps get a bit
more funding. . .however, it is not outside the realm of possibility.

As many of you know, there was little or no funding for myself or the
Gutenberg Project during the year ending about 1 1/2 years ago, and a
schedule revision was necessary. . .we had hoped to continue doubling
our Etext output every year, as we had done since around 1991:  which
would have been a schedule that looked something like this:

1024 per month in 2001
 512 per month in 2000
 256 per month in 1999
 128 per month in 1998
  64 per month in 1997
  32 per month in 1996
  16 per month in 1995
   8 per month in 1994
   4 per month in 1993
   2 per month in 1992
   1 per month in 1991

Which would have allowed us to easily reach our goal of 10,000 Etext
by the end of 2001, which was our 30 year plan for Project Gutenberg

However, we were forced to stop our growth for a while, and just get
things to keep rolling along for a while, and thus created this:

42 per month in 2001 would reach a total of 3,333
42 per month in 2000
36 per month in 1999 would reach a total of 2,000
36 per month in 1998
32 per month in 1997 reached a total of over 1,000
32 per month in 1996
16 per month in 1995
 8 per month in 1994 reached a total of about 100
 4 per month in 1993
 2 per month in 1992
 1 per month in 1991
 From 1980-1990 we completed our first Bible and Shakespeare,
 but due to the new copyright extensions, the Shakespeare is
 still not able to be released.  Thus our total was 10 Etexts
 We counted Shakespeare and The Bible as 1 Etext each
 1 per year in 1971-1979 completed our first 9 Etexts
 which were mostly a "History of Democracy"

So much for all that for now. . .more next month, along with
the Etexts, of course, which are our primary objective. . . .

filenames will work for now, but the old one duplicated an /etext97....
