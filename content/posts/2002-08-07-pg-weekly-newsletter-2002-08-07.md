David Widger would like to complete the works of Edward Bulwer Lytton for
Project Gutenberg and has two bookshelves of these books scanned--but he is
running out of steam.  He will mail a printed book and email the raw text
file ready for proofing to anyone who would like to produce one of these
books giving any guidance needed to those who are new to the game.

Many Thanks!

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

A new mailing list "gut-tv@listserv.unc.edu" has been added.
This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free
eBooks This Week" which highlights the free eBooks posted in the
past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help
write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

Personal Request:

I have tried to order many times, nothing ever arrived.

Thanks for any assistance you can provide!

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

(This number includes the 85 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)


In the first 31 weeks of the new year, we have produced 1,412 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,712 eTexts online as of July 31th, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.75 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.73 when we had 3731 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.98 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

DIGITAL ALTERATIONS IN 'SPIDER-MAN' OKAYED AS FREE SPEECH
A federal judge in New York has thrown out a lawsuit filed by billboard and
building owners against Sony and other companies involved in making and
distributing the movie "Spider-Man," saying that digital alterations of the
billboards in Times Square for the movie are protected free speech. "What
exists here is for artistic purposes a mixture of fictionally and actually
depicted Times Square, this has First Amendment protection," ruled Judge
Richard Owen. In the "Spider-Man" movie and trailers, ads for companies
such as Cingular Wireless and USA Today were superimposed over those of
Samsung and NBC. The judge also rejected claims that Sony's use of lasers
bounce off the plaintiff's three buildings day and night in the city that
never sleeps," said Owen. The practice of altering real-life scenes for the
purpose of film artistry or to satisfy marketing deals is becoming more
common as digital technology makes it easy to do so. USA Today said it
didn't pay for the advertising, but Cingular said it has a marketing deal
with Sony tied to the film. (CNet News.com 6 Aug 2002)

citizen, starting at birth, will be assigned a unique 11-digit number. At
present it will be used only to retrieve basic information (name, address,
sex, and birth date), but many people think the system will be expanded to
include other personal data. The new system has prompted widespread
disobedience in the country, and half a dozen cities have refused to have
any part of it. Nobuo Hoshino, mayor of Yokubunji, presiding over a
e-mail, fax and various other ways, and almost all of them support us." One
critic says that the project will grow and grow into "a bigger project,
named 'E-Government,' that will have 16,000 administrative uses." (New York

IN CHINA, MAN GETS 11 YEARS FOR USING NET "SUBVERSIVELY"
In Beijing, a man has been sentenced to 11 years in prison for posting
"reactionary" material on the Web; he was accused of "subverting the power
of the State." The man was arrested last April and brought to trial the
following month. Human rights groups are supporting the man's appeal to a
higher court, but a court date has not yet been set for that appeal.

HACKERS ARE GOOD, CRACKERS ARE BAD

Headlines From Edupage:

JAPANESE ID SYSTEM HAS BUMPY LAUNCH
Japanese authorities launched a computer identification system, but
technical problems and protests resulted in a difficult beginning for
it. The former system was criticized for being slow and difficult,
often requiring citizens to visit several agencies to accomplish a task
as simple as changing one's address. The new system assigns ID
numbers, similar to Social Security Numbers, and shares personal
information across branches of government. Many Japanese protested the
system, however, citing privacy concerns. Several municipalities
refused to submit data for their citizens, and the city of Yokohama,
where 3.4 million people live, said it will only submit information for
people who have given their consent. In addition, when the new system
was launched, several municipalities could not access it due to
technical problems.

NEC OFFERS ALL-IN-ONE, ECO-FRIENDLY COMPUTER
Computer maker NEC will produce an all-in-one computer that the company
says is very environmentally friendly. The PowerMate, which is expected
to cost $1,599, employs a 15-inch flat-panel monitor and a Transmeta
processor, with all of the primary components housed behind the
monitor. Because the screen is a flat-panel model, it does not contain
the several pounds of lead that a CRT monitor has. NEC also said the
motherboard is made with lead-free solder and that the plastic case is
completely recyclable. The machine runs on relatively little
electricity, requiring no internal fan, and has an extremely quiet hard
drive. The other selling point of the PowerMate, its all-in-one design,
has a mixed history in the market. Despite Apple Computer's success
with the first-generation iMac, sales of newer iMacs as well as
all-in-one computers from IBM and Gateway have been slow.

H-P WITHDRAWS WARNING
Hewlett-Packard has backed down after a strong and vocal reaction
against the company's threat to use the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (DMCA) against programmers who disclose flaws in H-P's software.
The company had sent a letter to SnoSoft, invoking the copyright
legislation as grounds for potential legal action against the
researchers for disclosing security flaws in its Unix software. Many
took the letter as an attempt to stifle independent research into
system security. According to an official at H-P, the reaction was
"significant." H-P would not comment on whether it would pursue action
against SnoSoft outside the DMCA, but the company said it would not
rely on the DMCA and that researchers who follow "industry standard
security practice" have no reason to fear legal warnings from H-P.

UTAH MAN SUES UNDER STATE'S NEW SPAM LAW
A Utah man has filed a class-action lawsuit against Sprint under the
state's recently enacted legislation concerning unsolicited e-mail.
Utah's law requires that companies sending unsolicited e-mail must
provide their legal name and address, put "ADV:" in the subject, and
allow consumers to opt out of receiving more messages. The law allows
for damages of up to $10 for each unwanted e-mail that is sent, up to
$25,000 per day. Terry Gillman sued Sprint, saying the company did not
abide by the restrictions the new law places on senders of e-mail
solicitations. In an odd twist, Sprint requested that Mr. Gillman turn
over his hard drive so that the company could "better investigate and
prevent such alleged violations." An attorney for Gillman said the
request is an intimidation tactic and that it would be "ridiculous" for
all of the 1.4 million potential plaintiffs to submit hard drives.

CLARKE URGES HACKERS TO FIND AND REPORT BUGS
Richard Clarke, the cybersecurity advisor to President Bush, told
attendees of the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas that they should
find and report software bugs that compromise computer security. Clarke
said that some of those listening "have an obligation to find the
vulnerabilities." According to Clarke, hackers should be responsible in
their disclosures of bugs, letting the software company know first and
allowing the company time to fix the bug before the weakness is made
public. If someone finds a bug and acts in good faith to see that it is
addressed, that person should not be prosecuted, Clarke said, saying
that legal protections may need to be installed for hackers disclosing
security flaws.

H-P USES DMCA AGAINST BUG FINDERS
In an apparent first, Hewlett-Packard has invoked the controversial
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to stop researchers from
releasing information about software bugs. Until now, the DMCA has been
used by copyright holders to prevent, for example, release of programs
that allow for the circumvention of copyright protections. But H-P sent
a letter to SnoSoft, a group of researchers, saying that the group
faces fines of $500,000 and jail time for releasing information about a
bug in an H-P Unix application. SnoSoft said that they notified H-P of
the flaw early enough that a patch should have been available before
public disclosure of the bug. An attorney at the Electronic Frontier
Foundation said he expects more companies to try to use the DMCA in
this way because the very broad terms and interpretation of the law
allow for such prosecution. Even in circumstances unrelated to
protecting copyright, he said, such actions "will trigger DMCA penalties."

STIFF SENTENCES FOR ONLINE FRAUD
Two Missouri men convicted of committing online fraud have been given
12-year prison sentences, highlighting a trend toward tougher
prosecution and longer sentences for such crimes. The men were
convicted of offering items for sale on Internet auction sites but not
delivering the goods after they were paid for. An official at the
Federal Trade Commission said he thought that five or six years ago,
prosecutors might not have pursued these cases or argued for such long
sentences. The sweep that caught the two men in Missouri will lead to
at least 19 other prosecutions, according to the FTC. Records show that
online auction fraud is the leading source of Internet complaints to the FTC.
