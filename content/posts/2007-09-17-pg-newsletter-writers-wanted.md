Since my relocation to Germany I'm struggling to find as much time to research and put together interesting articles for the newsletter, so I'm putting this request out for volunteers.

You will not be expected to write dozens of articles per week, although you are welcome :-) but if there were just a handful of people writing one per week or fortnight, this would really help to provide more interesting content for the newsletter.

Back in August, Marie Lebert wrote the excellent '[The @folio Project](/20070820/the-folio-project/ "The @folio Project")' article and has indicated that she may have one or two more over the coming months. You could join her and help the PG Newsletter become more than just a stats listing.

If you're interested please email me using the [contact](/contact/ "Contact PG-News") page.

I look forward to hearing from you.
