Project Gutenberg Needs YOU. . .NOW!!!

We Could Reach 10,000 eBooks This Year With Your Help!!!

Details Follow
[in longer note]

You can make history.

You can become an Internet pioneer.

You can be someone who will never be forgotten.

You can be part of the first 1% of the 1,000,000 eBooks
Project Gutenberg is planning to put on the Internet. . .
free eBooks. . .for everyone throughout the rest of history.

April 10, 2002 was the day Project Gutenberg reached 5,000 eBooks.

By Moore's Law October 10, 2003 could be the day for #10,000. . . .

We are just over half way. . .7,661 as I write this. . .2,339 to go!

That will take over 300 eBooks per month, we need you to help us push
our average up from 268 per month to get to 10,000 by December, 31st!

I bet a free dinner #10,000 will come by November, Charles Franks
bet it will be December, and various mathematical predictions have a
range from October 10th to January 21st.

YOU can make history. . .YOU can make this date a day earlier simply
by helping add a book a month to our current total of 7,650 eBooks--
and all you have to do is read a book a month and tell us the errors
we need to fix. . .we will supply the books, scan them, and put them
on line so you can see them and help correct them.

You can do this with our Distributed Proofreaders:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp

Or you can buy any of your favorite books from before 1923, and send
them to us for scanning, or you can scan or type them yourself.

Just under 14 books per day, and #10,000 could be on October 10!!!
Just over 12 books per day, and that day could be October 28
Just over 11 books per day, and that day could be November 15
Just over 10 books per day, and that day could be December 7
Just over 9 books per day, and that day would be January 3
Just over 8 books per day, and that day would be February 5

This CAN be done!!!!!!!

So far this year:

57 books per week in January
62 per week in February
67 in March. . . .

YOU can help us start doing 77 books per month!!!

I hope to be thanking you soon for your help in breaking down
the bars of ignorance and illiteracy.

Thanks!!!

Michael S. Hart
