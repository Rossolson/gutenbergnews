DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!


Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


We will also have this
new address in Chicago!


Charles Aldarondo
701 Riverside Drive
Park Ridge, IL 60068


Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

From: Miranda van de Heijning &lt;m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com&gt;
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

Planetary scanning help needed in Yorkshire, England for fragile 19th

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the 4 weeks of this year, we have produced 237 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1995 to produce our FIRST 237 eBooks!!!

         That's 4 WEEKS as Compared to 24 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 6,980 eBooks online as of January 1, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.43 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.25 when we had 4450 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.82 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

MICROSOFT, HEAL THYSELF!
Microsoft has been embarrassed by having to acknowledge that the SQL
Slammer virus, which infected computer servers all over the world, also
contaminated some of Microsoft's own servers, because system administrators
had failed to heed the company's own advice to install a software patch
months ago to fix a known system vulnerability. A Microsoft executive had
to admit: "We, like the rest of the industry, struggle to get 100%
compliance with our patch management. We recognize -- now more than ever --
that this is something we need to work on. And, like the rest of the
industry, we're working to fix it." (New York Times 28 Jan 2003)

RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION (RFID) TAGS READY TO GO
A number of new consumer products from companies such as Gillette, Procter
& Gamble, and Prada will come with embedded RFID (radio frequency
identification) "tags" (actually, tiny computer chips), that will contain
scannable information such as the product's serial number. The goal is to
dramatically improve inventory processes, and other big companies poised to
join the RFID movement are Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Home Depot
and Target. Within a year or two RFID tags will be included in all kinds of
products, including Michelin and Goodyear tires (to tell where a tire was
made). Privacy groups are expressing fears that thieves will buy or make
chip scanners that can crack security controls to scan shoppers' bags and
know what they bought. (USA Today 28 Jan 2003)

CELL PHONE USE CAN IMPAIR VISION WHILE DRIVING
Researchers at the University of Utah have found that drivers using cell
phones, even hands-free devices, experience a decrease in the ability to
process peripheral vision, creating a potentially lethal "tunnel vision."
This "inattention blindness" slows reaction time by 20% and resulted in
some of the 20 test subjects missing half the red lights they encountered
in simulated driving. "We found that when people are on the phone, the
amount of information they are taking in is significantly reduced," says
associate professor David Strayer. "People were missing things, like cars
swerving in front or sudden lane changes. We had at least three rear-end
collisions." The Utah study is only the latest investigation into the
effects of driving and cell phone use, and most of the others have also
demonstrated some degree of impairment. And while most studies have focused
on the distractions of dialing or holding a phone, the Utah research tried
to focus on the distractions caused by having a conversation. New York is
the only state to have instituted laws against the practice, but 30 more
states have similar legislation pending. (CNet News.com 27 Jan 2003)

OPEN SOURCE ENCYCLOPEDIA BOASTS 100,000 ENTRIES
One of the Web's first open-source encyclopedias, Wikipedia, has reached a
milestone -- its English-language version has just published its 100,000th
article, just two years after the project's inception. This past year
particularly has seen a surge in growth, with editors adding 80,000 entries
to the English version and 33,000 more to the other language editions. The
Wikipedia is the result of collaboration among thousands of volunteers --
anyone may contribute and article, or edit an existing one, at any time.
"People from very diverse backgrounds can agree on what can be in an
encyclopedia article, even if they can't agree on something else," says
Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales. Topics range from Internet terms, such as
spamming and trolling, to more traditional subjects, such as unicycling.
Each page features an "Edit this page" link, which users can click on to
add their own revisions. Once a user has made an editing change, it is
posted immediately. Users can also view older versions of a page,
participate in a forum to discuss the page, view links or see related
changes. These options facilitate an ongoing "peer-review" process among
the Wiki community. To maintain some sense of order, a core group of
regular contributors help monitor the site's recent changes to correct any
errors and ensure that entries aren't vandalized. The project has proven so
popular among its fans that it's spawned a sister project dubbed
Wiktionary, a free multilingual dictionary and thesaurus.

TELECOMS TRY TO PULL THE PLUG ON IP PHONE NUMBERS
Telecom giants Verizon, BellSouth and Qwest are voicing their concerns over
the current system used to assign telephone numbers to voice-over-IP (VoIP)
providers such as Net2Phone and Vonage. Currently, VoIP firms enjoy an
unrestricted flow of new numbers passed down by other carriers, which they
can assign as they choose. But at a recent meeting of the North American
Numbering Council, Verizon and other carriers objected to what they see as
unorthodox number allocation practices among VoIP providers and asked the
FCC to look into the Internet-phone industry's use of "designer numbers,"
among other things. One observer warned that a move to restrict available
phone numbers could prove fatal to the fledgling industry: "The results
could choke off the industry before it really gets going." But a BellSouth
spokesman downplayed those concerns: "The idea is not to choke this thing
off, but to explore the issues and reach some agreements so we can go
forward." The debate comes as U.S. government reports estimate that the
U.S., Canada, Guam, Bermuda and Trinidad will run out of 10-digit numbers
by the year 2025. (CNet News.com 27 Jan 2003)

RETAILERS FORM THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC VENTURE
Six retail music store chains are teaming up to form a joint venture called
Echo, which will offer retailers technology and access to individual tracks
for downloading to portable devices and PCs. Each retailer will be able to
decide how to use the Echo service -- for example, stores could offer a
compilation CD of music tracks, allowing customers to access some of them
for free and charging a fee to listen to the rest. Portable players could
be sold pre-loaded with music that buyers could listen to for a fee.
Retailers could also allow customers to download tracks at in-store kiosks
or via Web sites like Radio Free Virgin. The Echo founders are Best Buy,
Tower Records, Virgin Entertainment Group, Wherehouse Music, Hastings
Entertainment and Trans World Entertainment, operator of FYE, Strawberries
and Coconuts stores. "We're trying to make digital music work in a mass
market way, for millions of people. That hasn't happened yet," says Echo
CEO Dan Hart. "I think consumers will pay, but you have to provide the
greater level of value. We're the traditional trading partner of the
labels. We understand marketing and how to provide value to consumers."
Echo is working with Microsoft and RealNetworks to incorporate digital
rights management software in order to control how the songs are copied
or shared over the Internet. (AP 27 Jan 2003)

HIGH-TECH GROUP BATTLES HOLLYWOOD ON COPYRIGHT ISSUES
The Alliance for Digital Progress (ADP) -- a new Washington, D.C.-based
lobbying group whose members include Microsoft, Dell, Motorola and the
Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) -- will fight
Hollywood's positions on access to digital music, movies, and books, and
the entertainment industry's efforts to require anti-copying technology in
digital entertainment devices. ITAA president Harris N. Miller says
sarcastically that Hollywood leaders "would have organized to burn down
Gutenberg's printing press, if they were alive during that period of rapid
change and innovation." (AP/USA Today 24 Jan 2003)

JAPANESE FIRMS EYE NON-PC MUSIC DOWNLOADS
Sony, Pioneer, Sharp and Kenwood are teaming up to develop a format that
will enable audio equipment to be connected to the Internet directly for
downloading music files, eliminating the need for a PC. The new venture,
dubbed Any Music Planning, will begin operations on Feb. 1 and plans to
have Net-accessible audio equipment, software, and a music distribution
service available to consumers by next fall. To prevent illegal copying,
the software will include Open MG X copyright control technology from Sony.
The technology blocks users who have downloaded music onto a MiniDisc, for
example, from reproducing it again unless they obtain a key from the record
label. The companies hope that the new digital music format will boost
sales of audio equipment, which is widely viewed as having passed its peak.

SENATE DELAYS FUNDING FOR PENTAGON SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM
The U.S. Senate voted yesterday to block funding of the Defense
Department's Total Information Awareness (TIA) program, which when
developed would use "data mining" techniques to scan for patterns in
worldwide communications activity and use those patterns to identify
terrorist threats. Calling TIA "the most far-reaching government
surveillance program in history," Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said that by
blocking R&D funds the Senate thereby "makes it clear that Congress wants
to make sure there is no snooping on law-abiding Americans," even if the
purpose of the activity is to prevent terrorist attacks against the United
States. (Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 24 Jan 2003)

IDENTITY THEFTS DOUBLED LAST YEAR
The number of identity thefts doubled in 2002, with 162,000 reports of
identity theft compared to 86,000 the previous year. However, the Federal
Trade Commission says that the rise in identity theft complaints does not
necessarily mean an increase in actual crimes -- it may simply reflect an
increasing public awareness of the problem and a greater likelihood that
such incidents are now being reported. But an official of the Michigan
State Police points out that many former violent criminals are now using
the Internet for identity theft: "They are switching over to white-collar
crime because it's more lucrative and they know they will get less time.
Identity theft is not necessarily a sophisticated crime."

COPYRIGHT LAW IS A TWO-WAY STREET
Robin Gross, head of the new watchdog group IP Justice and former
Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney, says copyright holders are taking
unfair advantage of new technologies to restrict use of their content:
"Sure, (digital technology) makes it easier for people to copy and share
works, but digital technology also makes it easier for copyright holders to
restrict what people can do with their works. So it's not fair to say that
this technology is "very harmful to these industries because it's actually
providing them with more power than they've ever had before to control what
people can do with their works. That point is often overlooked -- that
they're controlling it to the point that they're taking away from the
public side of the copyright bargain. So while it's not fair for consumers
to copy and distribute copyright works in a fashion that doesn't compensate
the creators, it's also not fair for the creators to use digital technology
to take away the rights of the public. For example, making sure these works
fall into the public domain at some point, or making sure that consumers
are able to exercise their fair-use rights. It's simply not fair for the
copyright holders to take all of the rights and have none of the
responsibilities associated with copyright law." (CNet News.com 23 Jan 2003)

LATEST WORM USES NETWORK CONNECTIONS, NOT E-MAIL
The latest wide-scale Internet attack exploited a weakness in
Microsoft's SQL Server 2000 and used network connections rather than
e-mail to propagate itself. The "Slammer" or "Sapphire" worm hit over
the weekend, slowing down Internet traffic significantly, to the point
of causing some automatic teller machines not to function. South Korea,
which is regarded as having relatively weak computer security, was one
of the areas most affected by the worm. The worm can be defeated simply
by turning off an infected machine, but other measures must be taken to
prevent the machine from being reinfected. Security experts said this
latest attack highlights the reactionary approach of many network
administrators because, like the Code Red and Nimda attacks, this one
exploits a known weakness for which fixes are available but not
universally implemented.

NEW ONLINE MUSIC VENTURE
Six music retailers have formed a consortium to sell music over the
Internet. Echo Inc. includes Best Buy, Hastings Entertainment, Tower
Records, Trans World Entertainment Corp., Virgin Entertainment Group,
and Wherehouse Music and was formed in a direct response to dropping
sales of CDs, largely attributed to online piracy and sharing of music
files. Echo Chief Executive Dan Hart said the consortium will work to
establish licensing deals with various record labels. Observers noted
that the creation of Echo suggests that the six retailers hope that by
working as a group, they can arrange better licensing deals than if
they worked independently. Other such consortia have not fared well in
the marketplace, including Echo's predecessor, Echo Networks. Still,
the retailers feel they must do something to fight falling profits.
Wherehouse last week filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and
Best Buy will close more than 100 of its Musicland stores.

IDENTITY THEFT ON THE RISE
The Federal Trade Commission reports that identity theft is the most
commonly reported consumer crime, comprising 43 percent of complaints.
In 2002, 162,000 reports were filed, up from 86,000 in 2001, an
increase which may reflect heightened consumer awareness more than an
increase in identity-theft crimes. Statistics for the FTC report are
compiled from state and federal sources. The most common use for stolen
identities is to open credit card accounts (25 percent), followed by
bank and loan frauds and false cell-phone accounts. Identity theft
often involves an insider at an organization who has access to personal
information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, dates of
birth, and the like. The rise of white-collar crime, including identity
theft, is due in part to its relative ease and to less severe penalties
compared with those for violent crimes. As more people use the Internet
to process information like bank and loan applications, the potential
for such fraud increases.

SENATE INTRODUCES MORATORIUM ON DATA-MINING PROJECT
The U.S. Senate voted 69 to 29 to add to an appropriations bill a
moratorium on the government's Total Information Awareness (TIA)
program. TIA is the federal government's planned data-mining tool,
which would comb disparate data sources looking for indications of
terrorist activity. Privacy advocates have fought against TIA since it
was announced, saying that it would give the government a free hand in
snooping on its citizens and could pose a significant threat to civil
liberties. The Senate-introduced moratorium would ban use of TIA unless
specific authorization is given by Congress or the president can show
that not using TIA would "endanger the national security of the United
States." Because a House of Representatives version of the
appropriations bill does not include the moratorium,
its fate will be decided by a conference committee.

MONSTERHUT LOSES SPAM CASE
A victory against spam was scored when New York State Supreme Court
Justice Lottie E. Wilkins banned MonsterHut, a Niagara Falls-based
company, from sending unsolicited e-mails. Accused of sending around
500 million unwanted commercial e-mails, MonsterHut told recipients who
complained that they had requested the solicitations through an ^Sopt
in^T feature. State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued MonsterHut on
behalf of roughly 750,000 Internet users who, since March 2001, had
tried and failed to get off MonsterHut^Rs e-mail lists. MonsterHut
claimed that it had obtained "third-party, permission-based"
agreements, which amounts to having acquired e-mail addresses from
other organizations that had received permission to send ads. Judge
Wilkins determined that MonsterHut had "not offered any proof or legal
basis to demonstrate that their practice conforms with industry-wide
accepted 'opt in' protocols" and barred MonsterHut from further
"fraudulent, deceptive and illegal acts and practices."

LATEST GROUP TO OPPOSE COPY CONTROLS
The latest group to argue against government mandates for protecting
digital content is the newly created Alliance for Digital Progress
(ADP), which is made up of 27 organizations, including major high-tech
companies Apple Computer, Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard, and
Microsoft. Frederick McClure, president of ADP, said the new group
opposes efforts by media companies to push governmental action on copy
controls. He said the ADP is concerned about protection of copyrighted
material but supports private-sector actions to deal with the problem.
McClure cited a survey that showed 72 percent of Americans think
private-sector efforts are the best way to control digital piracy and
said that revenues for the motion picture industry have continued to
increase even while it complains about piracy. Technology companies
have opposed all proposals, including the Consumer Broadband and
Digital Television Promotion Act, introduced by Senator Fritz Hollings,
that would require copy-protection features to be installed on consumer
electronics devices.

SEVIS DATA STOLEN FROM UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS
Officials from the University of Kansas reported that someone broke
into the campus's computer network and stole personal information on
more than 1,400 foreign students. The information had been collected as
part of the university's compliance with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's new Student and Exchange Visitor Information
System (SEVIS), which is designed to track foreign students studying at
U.S. institutions of higher education. University officials said the
hacker broke in five times and used campus resources for other
activity, leading them to believe the theft of SEVIS data was not the
hacker's goal. An agent from the FBI, which is investigating the
incident, agreed that so far there is no evidence to suggest the
actions are related to terrorism.

VERIZON ORDERED TO IDENTIFY SUBSCRIBER
U.S. District Judge John D. Bates has ruled that Verizon Communications
must reveal the identity of one of its subscribers, accused by the
recording industry of illegally sharing more than 600 copyrighted
songs. Citing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the recording
industry, which was able to obtain an IP address for the user, had
demanded that Verizon reveal the identity of that user. Verizon
refused, saying it has an obligation to protect the privacy of its
subscribers. This ruling defeats Verizon's argument, allowing
copyright owners to obtain the identity of suspected pirates through a
subpoena from a U.S. District Court clerk's office. Critics complained
that the ruling allows copyright owners to circumvent judicial
supervision and collect users' identities based only on allegations of
wrongdoing. Verizon said it will appeal the ruling and will not reveal
the user's identity unless the Court of Appeals orders it to do so.
