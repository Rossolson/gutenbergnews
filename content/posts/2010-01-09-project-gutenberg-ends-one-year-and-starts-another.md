<img class="alignleft" title="Project Gutenberg Logo" src="/images/project-gutenberg-logo.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="100" />Noon, January 6, 2010, is the end of our calendar production year number 39 and the beginning of our 40th year, though our 40 years of calendar time won't be complete until July 5, 2011.

### Milestones Of The Year

In 2009 we saw our 35,000th internally produced eBook go out, and our 25,000 in English, our 1,500th in French, 600th in German and 500th in Finnish. We also saw Dutch and Chinese pass 400 eBooks. (We still need to find ways to do more in Spanish and Portuguese.)

These 35,000+ eBooks, which represent over 50 languages are all at [www.gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org "Project Gutenberg"). There are also over 75,000 Donated eBooks representing over 100 languages are at [www.gutenberg.cc](http://www.gutenberg.cc "Gutenberg CC"). In total, counting the eBooks donated to us from other eLibraries, individuals and schools Gutenberg.cc now has well over 100,000 titles, though it is probably closer to an even 100,000, given various duplications, etc.

### Production Year Statistics

The numbers presented below will approximate what are recorded as of noon on January 6, and the production year will be recorded as running last year from Wednesday, January 7, 2009 through January 6, 2010, and the coming year will end on January 5, 2011.<!--more-->

Thus we had 52 Wednesdays this past year for 364 days; every once in a while we get 53 production weeks on this calendar, which has to be one reason for eventually changing it.
