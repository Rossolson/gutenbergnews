Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners

So far we have sent out 2.5 million eBooks via snailmail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email Aaron:

cannona@fireantproductions.com

We can set you up with images or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them to readers
whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack
of the these and send the whole box back for reshipping
to individual addresses.

We can also send you blank discs in quantities of 50-100
an *perhaps* also provide envelopes, sleeves, etc.

We also have many volunteers who only have time to do one
DVD per day and mail it out.  These are greatly appreciated.
There is no need to do a lot per person if we have a lot of
people working on this.

Project Gutenberg--Canada is now starting up!!!

Please let us know if you would like to volunteer!
Copyright in Canada is "Life +50" as in Australia,
and we have volunteers working on both of these.
We will also be seeking volunteers from others of
the "life +50" countries, as it looks as if the
Australian copyright law is falling victim to the
new "Economic Warfare" being waged by the World
Intellectual Property Organization and various
billionaire copyright holders around the world.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 19 weeks of this year, we have produced 1793 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our FIRST 1793 eBooks!!!

         That's 19 WEEKS as Compared to ~28 YEARS!!!


With 12,700 eBooks online as of May 17, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.79 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.26 when we had 7803 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine ~12,500 books each costing ~$.45 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~12,500 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 12,700 eBooks in 32 Years and 10.50 Months We Averaged
      386 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       32.0 Per Month
        1.05 Per Day

At 1793 eBooks Done In The 131 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
     14 Per Day
     94 Per Week
    400 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


&gt;From NewsScan:

FORRESTER SPEEDS UP TIMELINE ON WHITE-COLLAR OFFSHORING
Forrester Research says the export of white-collar jobs is happening
faster than it had first predicted back in 2002, but that its long-term
outlook for offshore outsourcing hasn't changed much since that report,
which estimated that a cumulative 3.3 million white-collar jobs would be
shifted to other countries by 2015. Forrester's revised numbers project a
total of 830,000 jobs offshored by 2005, up from its earlier estimate of
just under 600,000. Ironically, Forrester analyst John McCarthy says the
media's focus on the issue has encouraged more companies to experiment with
offshore outsourcing. "While the press visibility has spurred offshoring's
emergence as a political third rail, it has also fostered an increase in
overall offshore alternatives," says Forrester's revised report. (Wall
Street Journal 17 May 2004)

PANEL URGES MORE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN FEDERAL 'DATA-MINING'
      The Technology and Privacy Advisory Committee, a panel created by
U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to scrutinize Pentagon programs in
the wake of criticism over the ill-fated "Total/Terrorism Information
Awareness" program, is urging Congress to pass laws protecting citizens'
civil liberties from overly intrusive federal data mining activities. "The
Department of Defense should safeguard the privacy of U.S. persons when
using data mining to fight terrorism," says the panel's report, which notes
that privacy laws lag far behind current capabilities in information and
communications technology. A key recommendation suggests federal agencies
should be required to obtain approval from a special federal court "before
engaging in data mining with personally identifiable information concerning
U.S. persons." Former FCC Chairman Newton Minow, who headed up the panel,
acknowledges that the proposals would "impose additional burdens on
government officials," but maintains that the requirements would improve
national security while enhancing personal privacy: "Good privacy
protection in the context of data mining is often consistent with more
efficient investigation." (New York Times 17 May 2004)
http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/17/politics/17privacy.html

GOOGLE'S AD PLANS THREATEN 'BUSINESS AS USUAL'
Google is challenging the status quo in online advertising by
offering to pay its publishing partners for display ads only when users
click -- a move that has irked other online ad networks that maintain the
value of online ads lies in the number of eyeballs that see them (known as
cost per impression or CPM). "Google's making a public statement that the
only value of a banner is when it's clicked upon, and it flies in the face
of all the research done in the last five years that demonstrates the
impact a banner can have on brand awareness and purchase intent," says Dave
Moore, CEO of 24/7 Real Media. "Why shouldn't I get paid for creating the
step to the ultimate purchase?" As Google readies itself for its
$2.7-billion IPO, the move into display advertising makes sense, say some
ad execs. "Google's future revenue growth could depend on attracting major
brand advertisers, because that's where the money is," says the head of a
brand measurement company. (CNet News.com 17 May 2004)
http://news.com.com/2100-1024-5213714.html

[and in a related story]

GOOGLE TO SELL BANNER ADS ON OTHER SITES
Google has begun selling banner ads and other graphic ads, on a test
basis, for display on other companies' Web sites. The new ads won't appear
on Google's own site, though Google says that may change in the future. (The
company now sells only small text ads related to the content of a page on
its own site.) Google vice president Tim Armstrong says that advertisers are
moving away from cost-per-thousand pricing to a system that's much more
targeted specifically to most-likely customers: "The world of advertising is
getting more quantitative and data-driven," he says.

[and even more, this time from Yahoo]

YAHOO: 'ALL (OR MOST) RETAILING IS LOCAL'
Yahoo thinks there's a lot of money to be made by linking Web surfers
with local retailers, restaurants, dry cleaners and other businesses.
(Currently, 20-25% of online queries have some local component.) Ted Meisel,
president of Yahoo's search engine subsidiary Overture, says: "We think now
is the right time to go after the local market. We are seeing users start to
look for local information and we see commerce opportunities in local
search... We are going to make it easier for advertisers to participate."
Yahoo senior marketing executive Cammie Dunaway says: "Yahoo is pretty
multidimensional. It is a great search engine, but it is much more than a
search engine." (Of course, Google is also busy adding features such as free
e-mail that will make it "much more than a search engine.") Yahoo's
marketing emphasis will be on major retailers and other large businesses in
a region, as well as the creation of a locator page for small businesses
that currently have no online presence. (Washington Post 13 May 2004)

[and. . .wow lots of stories on these]

COMMERCIAL SEARCH ENGINES THREATEN NEWSPAPERS' LIVELIHOOD
Newspapers face a greater threat of revenue erosion from online
local-search products than they do from online job listings like
Monster.com, according to a new study by The Neil Budde Group and the
Advanced Interactive Media Group. "For local publishers, which have already
been fighting the 'new monsters' eating away at their classified
advertising, this may be a far greater challenge than the first Internet
wave. Well-funded competitors like Yahoo and Google are only starting to
target the local market, so local media still have time to respond," says
study co-author Neil Budde. The report notes that local advertisers like
car-repair shops, plumbers and restaurants could migrate to local search
pages, leaving newspapers' bottom lines bleeding red ink. "The ability to
directly target advertising at consumers, and to determine exactly  what
the response to those ads has been, gives local advertisers more power than
ever before to focus their spending where it works," says co-author Peter
Zollman. "Few local publishers have realized yet how this will endanger
their business, and even fewer have responded with effective local search
tools for their advertisers." (AIM Group news release 11 May 2004)

THE BIG SWITCH FROM LANDLINE TO WIRELESS
The Federal Communications Commission says that at least 2.8 million
U.S. consumers have moved their telephone number between wireless carriers
or between a wireless phone and a landline phone since November.
FCC chairman Michael Powell says he switched carriers for his work wireless
phone as well as for his wife and son and that he "was shocked at how well
it worked." (Reuters/USA Today 14 May 2004)

HISTORY CHANNEL USES VIDEOGAME TO REINFORCE ITS LESSONS
The History Channel's 13-episode series on "Decisive Battles" that
debuts July 17 makes use of a not-yet-released PC game to visually
re-create the epic battles that mark ancient Rome's colorful history.
"Rome: Total War" will be published by Activision this fall, but the
real-time strategy game already received accolades at last year's
Electronic Entertainment Expo, where it won an award for strategy game of
the year. The History Channel is betting that by incorporating videogame
graphics into its series, it will score points with younger viewers and
perhaps woo back some of the male cohort, aged 8-34, that reports spending
more time on games than watching television. In one episode, "Decisive
Battles" uses computer animation to provide an overview of the Battle of
Cannae, in which Hannibal and his vastly outnumbered troops completely
surrounded the Roman army using an ingenious crescent-shaped formation to
ensnare the Roman soldiers. Once trapped, the Roman legions were clustered
so tightly that they were helpless against Hannibal's infantry and his
Libyan spearmen. "We're pioneering something new in this series, and we'll
see how it evolves," says "Decisive Battles" executive producer Margaret Kim.
"The gaming industry is one of the fastest-growing, and it's likely that we'll
see more convergence between video games and programming in the future."

FEDS NO LONGER RECOGNIZING BOGUS DEGREES
Following an investigation by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the
federal government's Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has
announced a new policy of not recognizing degrees from diploma mills.
The GAO report identified several hundred federal employees, including
some high-level officials, who had reported earning degrees from
unaccredited institutions. Kay Coles James, director of OPM, sent a
memo to all federal managers stating that diplomas from degree mills
cannot be used in applying for any federal job, obtaining salary
increases, or receiving tuition reimbursement. The memo stated, in
part, "You may not send employees to diploma mills for degree training
or any other form of education.... You may not use your authority to
repay student loans if the degree is from a diploma mill." According to
the OPM, diploma mills are institutions that are unaccredited or that
award degrees with little or no coursework.

[Makes you wonder how many such degrees were already recognized]

[Aha!]

GAO FINDS FEDERAL EMPLOYEES WITH FAKE DEGREES
The General Accounting Office (GAO) this week released findings from an
investigation into diploma mills. According to the report, hundreds of
federal employees list degrees from diploma mills on their resumes, and
some employees used federal tuition funds to pay for those degrees. The
GAO found 28 high-level officials who have degrees from diploma mills
and 463 employees who list degrees from unaccredited institutions in
their qualifications. Data obtained from two unaccredited institutions
shows $170,000 in federal tuition funds used at those schools. The
investigation was ordered by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chair of the committee, started looking into
diploma mills two years ago. According to Collins, there is "clear evidence
that tax dollars are being wasted on bogus degrees from unaccredited
institutions that the federal government does not even recognize."

MEDIA LAB LAUNCHES NEW INITIATIVE   [Consumber Electronics Lab]
Nicholas Negroponte, director of MIT's Media Lab, this week announced
a new initiative focused on Consumer Electronics and the technologies
that drive them. The CELab will not have distinct facilities but will
include research projects at both the Media Lab in Massachusetts and
Media Lab Europe, based in Ireland. Because the new lab will not
require separate physical space, it has the possibility to generate
significant income for Media Lab with very low overhead costs.
Negroponte said people will soon be "eating, wearing, and breathing
computers" and that the CELab will be instrumental in developing the
technologies that will enable this breed of consumer electronics.
Negroponte made the announcement to a group of executives from consumer
electronics companies he hopes will join CELab as members. Companies
that become members, for as much as $200,000 per year, will be able to
license intellectual property developed by the lab and to join the
lab's steering committee.

REPORT CALLS ON U.S. GOVERNMENT TO REOPEN SITES
A government-funded report by the Rand Corporation calls on the Bush
administration to allow Web sites and databases that were shut down in
the aftermath of the September 11 attacks to be allowed back online.
Thirty-six Web sites were taken offline, as were more than 600
databases, based on concern that they made available information that
could be used by terrorists in future attacks. According to the Rand
Corporation's assessment, however, none of the sites included
information that isn't available elsewhere, such as in textbooks, in
trade journals, or on maps. Of the 629 databases taken down, only 4
were found to contain information that the researchers saw as
warranting restricted access. The report was welcomed by critics of the
administration's handling of the situation following the terrorist
attacks. Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American
Scientists' project on government secrecy, said he hopes the report
"brings some rationality back to this policy."

PANEL CALLS FOR RESTRAINT IN DATA MINING
A federal panel has written a report that calls on the Defense
Department as well as other areas of government to institute strong
measures to protect civil liberties in the context of data mining.
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld appointed the panel, called the
Technology and Privacy Advisory Committee, in early 2003 in response to
criticisms of the Pentagon's data-mining program, the Terrorism
Information Awareness program. The panel's report, which is expected
to be released in about two weeks, says that although the goals of
data-mining programs are worthwhile, the government must take steps to
ensure that they do not infringe on individuals' privacy. The panel
also called on Congress, the president, and the courts to be involved
in efforts to safeguard personal privacy, as federal agencies sift
through databases with personally identifiable information, trying to
combat terrorism. Newton N. Minow, head of the panel and former
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, noted that the
panel's recommendations would add a new burden of responsibility to
the government but said that the changes would enhance personal privacy
and ultimately national security. One panel member, William T. Coleman
Jr. filed a dissent, stating that the panel's proposals far exceed what
is required by the Constitution, federal laws, or former court decisions.
