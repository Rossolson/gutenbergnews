<img class="alignleft" title="Gutenberg Logo" src="/images/project-gutenberg-logo.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="100" />One of our newest projects is to solicit suggestions as to where Project Gutenberg should be in it's 50th year.  The current suggestions are:

<ol style="clear: both;">
  <li>
    Make it more obvious that PG wants error messages–how to write them, where to send them, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make it more obvious that PG will send DVD's so the people who have to pay by the megabyte can use PG.
  </li>
  <li>
    An extensive library of human read audiobooks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please make it more obvious how to do PG eBooks for Kindle, Sony, nook, and other eReaders.
  </li>
  <li>
    More current books under Creative Commons licenses. More apps for cellphones.  A model to encourage new writers to share their work in the same spirit. Showcase how people who used to be on the bad sides of various digital divides enjoyed and benefitted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please add more bookshelves, particularly one to do eBooks from each country and make sure each one has at least one eBook to show how it can be done.
  </li>
  <li>
    Proofread the Top 100 or so downloaded books to the point where we they approach perfection.
  </li>
</ol>

As part of the last point above, we are right now looking for volunteers to fine tooth comb the PG eBooks of _Alice In Wonderland_, _Through Looking-Glass_ & _Hunting Of The Snark_ for errors. So we need as many volunteers as possible to [let us know](/contact "Contact Gutenberg News") if you would like like to proofread Top Tens.

_<!--more-->If you have a project you would like to work on then why not send us a note and we'll see if we can get a team of volunteers to help._

### iPhone & eBook Reader Donations

Please Note: _**Project Gutenberg is a charitable 501(c)(3) organization in the U.S.**_

Project Gutenberg is seeking the donation of an iPhone, and perhaps other modern cell phones and eBook readers.  We are working on some new versions of content at www.gutenberg.org

These need to work, including in Europe , but without having a paid cell phone plan.  In other words, they need to be unlocked or unlockable.  We are particularly interested in devices that have built-in WiFi, so they can access content at www.gutenberg.org without the need of the cellular network at all.
