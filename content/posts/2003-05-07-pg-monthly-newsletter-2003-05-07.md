3) News

May 2003 Broadcast of Gutenberg Radio.

Featured :

The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne.
[The conclusion of Nemo's tale, Captain of the submarine Nautilus.]

Stereo : The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

Mono : The Legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles.

For Download :
[all downloads are in stereo, .mp3, zipped, one file per chapter.]

Franz Kafka Metamorphosis.
Jules Verne 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
Jules Verne The Mysterious Island.
H. G. Wells The Time Machine.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Bram Stoker Dracula.

All Gutenberg Radio broadcasts become part of the official Gutenberg
archives after review, possible editing and approval.  This usually
takes 6 to 8 weeks. And books are frequently reissued to leverage advances in
audio technology.

So don't despair if you miss a broadcast!  Soon it will be available at
http://www.promo.net/pg/ for download.  You are free to start a broadcast of
your own, as long as you abide by the Gutenberg copyrights
and procedures.  Basically, broadcast but DON'T SELL.

If you want to mark up a book for broadcast, watch these announcements.
We will be publishing a manual to help you do so in these pages. At the moment,
we would like novels and short stories in English more than anything
else. But Spanish is in our immediate future, as are biographies and histories,
thought these will be introduced somewhat later.

The Legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles.

In the time of the Great Rebellion, the Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo.
There was in him, a wanton, cruel humour. He came to love the daughter
of a yeoman, who held lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young
maiden would avoid him. So Hugo, with five or six companions, stole
down on the farm and carried off the maiden. By the aid of the growth
of ivy which covered the south wall of the manor, she escaped. Hugo
cried that he would render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil, if
he might overtake her.

Hugo's companions followed him over the moor, it opened into a broad space,
in which stood two of those great stones,  which were set by forgotten
peoples, in the days of old. The moon was shining bright upon the
clearing, and there in the center lay the maid where she had fallen
dead.  Standing over Hugo, plucking at his throat, stood a great,
black beast, shaped like a hound, larger than any hound that mortal
eye has seen. The thing tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville.


Some thoughts on the Gutenberg Edition of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

Born in the French river town of Nantes, Jules Verne (1828-1905) had a passion
for the sea. The stimulus for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was an 1865
fan letter from a fellow writer, Madame George Sand.  Initially,
Verne's narrative was influenced by the 1863 uprising of Poland
against Russia.  But in the 1860s, France had to treat Russia as an ally.

Shark attacks, giant squid, cannibals, hurricanes, whale hunts, and
other rip-roaring adventures erupt at random, giving the novel an air
of documentary realism. Verne adds backbone to the action by
developing three recurring motifs, Nemo's past life and future
intentions, the mounting tension between Nemo and harpooner Ned Land,
and Ned's ongoing schemes to escape from the Nautilus.

Verne regards the sea from many angles, in the domain of marine
biology, he gives us thumbnail sketches of fish, seashells, coral,
sometimes in great catalogs that swirl past like musical cascades;
in the realm of geology, he studies volcanoes literally inside and
out; in the world of commerce, he celebrates the high-energy
entrepreneurs who lay the Atlantic Cable or dig the Suez Canal.  And
Verne's marine engineering proves authoritative.  His specifications
for an open-sea submarine and a self-contained diving suit were
decades before their time.

Much of the novel's brooding power comes from captain Nemo.  Inventor,
musician, Renaissance genius, he's the prototype not only for
countless renegade scientists in popular fiction, even for Sherlock Holmes!

Dr. Robert D. Ballard, finder of the Titanic, confesses that this was
his favorite book as a teenager, and Cousteau, most renowned of marine
explorers, called it his shipboard bible.

This Gutenberg translation is a faithful rendering of the original
French texts published in Paris by J. Hetzel et Cie. Although prior
English versions have often been heavily abridged, this new
translation is complete, to the smallest substantive detail.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can

help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to
