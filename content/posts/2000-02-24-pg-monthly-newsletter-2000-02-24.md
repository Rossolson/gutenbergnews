requests, etc.  You will shortly receive one with the subject listed:

Project Gutenberg Needs You!!!

The Year 2000 Is Now Complete On Project Gutenberg Servers, #2450 Completed!

Project Gutenberg now accelerates once more, moving from the 36 eTexts/month
production level to 40 eTexts per month for at least the next 22 months!!!

Here are the details:  [Yes, my sentences are still too long. . .Michael]

December 2000 takes us up to Etext #2450, and is now nearly complete, except
for a few slots that have been reserved. . .say 1% of the total slots, so we
really have more like 2425 eTexts now posted. . . .  For the year 2000 these
Etexts were produced at an official rate of 36 per month, but we managed all
in all to average 40 eTexts per month; and since we are now 10 months ahead,
we are shifting to an official rate of 40 eTexts per month, which would take
us to about eText #3,333 by the end of 2001, with a total of about 15,000 of
these eTexts available worldwide from our various friends and competitors in
the eText world.  40 eTexts per month is 480 per year, and 880 over the next
22 months from March, 2000 to December, 2001.  Thus we should get about to a
collection officially numbering 3,330 by the end of December, 2001.  This is
about 1/3 of our original goal set 30 years earlier in 1971, because we were
anticipating a greater willingness for producers of public domain eTexts for
sharing such eTexts not only with the world, but with each other.  However I
must admit that it never occurred to me how the various eText producers were
not going to be very cooperative with each other in building a collection of
eTexts anyone could post on any server in the world.  OK. . .so I'm somewhat
of an Idealist. . .what else is new?!?!?!?!?!

2450 + 880 = 3300

We have added 15 more since, up to 2465.

NEW SEARCHABLE ROGET'S THESAURUS

A searchable thesaurus incorporating Project Gutenberg e-text of Roget's
Thesaurus (edition 13a) is now available. The author, Andy Green based in
London, has made it available as freeware. He says, "I originally built
the searchable thesaurus as a tool to be used in my project to develop a
natural language parser. Later I added the Windows front-end so it could
be used independently."

The application uses a full-text index to allow users to search the
thesaurus for any word.  Results are displayed in a layout that has the
look of a printed page, with the word searched for highlighted in red. The
Windows application can be downloaded from the site that also documents
his natural language parser project - http://www.cogitoergosum.co.uk.

From: Dan Lazarus (dlazarus@fatdrive.com)

I have been using the Gutenberg site for the past few months and noticed
through the newsletter that some folks have had problems storing and
accessing digital books.  I just webloaded a copy of Moby Dick to my free
web based storage and email (anyone can sign up for one at www.fatdrive.com).
By doing so, I can access this digital book along with all my other
files anywhere, anytime.   And, with the click of a button, I can share
my favorite books with friends.  [Dan said you can get 55M of storage,
and an email account, all free of charge.

Comments About Our New Files

I have placed the entire listing in chronological order this time,
instead of putting those from next month at the end.  I hope this
makes it easier for you who make your own indices from this file.
Let me know if you would prefer it back the other way.

A HELP! Message From the Project Gutenberg General Counsel
[This is a personal request for you to help her by sending
a bit of email to the press on her behalf, I have included
the email addresses so you won't even have to surf to some
sites she has listed, unless you want to.  More below.

"I've just come back from getting convicted of the crime of having
wildflowers in my yard instead of mowed grass, and I may end up in jail on

account of it.  The town I live in (Elsmere) has been hassling me for years,
because I sued them over voter fraud in an election a few years back (and
before that they were mad that I ran for Attorney General on the Libertarian
ticket in 1990), and this is the latest thing they've done to me in their
campaign to run me out of town  -- I've never even had a traffic ticket, and
now I've got a criminal record with jail time on it.  The people in the
probation office today said the local newspaper (The News Journal) would
like to know about this, because it has been running articles about the
corruption in Elsmere for years, and it's been getting worse lately (a town
manager who embezzled money from the town to fund her campaign for State
Treasurer, a pedophile on the police force, a fireman fired for associating
with gay people [for which the ACLU is suing], and a speed trap that's been
a statewide scandal for years, just to name a few).

I know you're busy, but this is my life here.

Would you please put out a message for people to e-mail (or write or fax)
the local or the national media and tell them what Elsmere is doing to me
is outrageous?  I'm filing an appeal of my criminal conviction, and a
groundswell of media attention would really help."
