DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!


Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


We will also have this
new address in Chicago!


Charles Aldarondo
701 Riverside Drive
Park Ridge, IL 60068


Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

***

From: Miranda van de Heijning &lt;m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com&gt;
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

Planetary scanning help needed in Yorkshire, England for fragile 19th
century books of A'bp Whately     Please contact:  david@whateley.org

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

In the 3 weeks of this year, we have produced 162 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1994 to produce our *FIRST* 162 eBooks!!!

         That's 3 WEEKS as Compared to 23 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 6,906 eBooks online as of January 1, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.45 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.26 when we had 4416 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.81 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 6906 eBooks in 31 1/2 Years We Averaged
    222 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     18 Per Month
     .6 Per Day

At 163 eBooks Done In 2003 We Averaged

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

[Is This "The Thought Police?"]

NEW WAY TO FOIL DATA THIEVES
Researchers at the State University of New York at Buffalo are
developing software that tracks and analyzes how each computer user
performs his or her routine tasks, such as opening files, sending e-mail
or searching archives, to create individual profiles. The "user-level
anomaly detection" software then alerts network administrators if a
worker's behavior deviates from his or her profile so that they can
monitor that employee's activities more aggressively. "The ultimate goal
is to detect intrusions or violations occurring on the fly," says head
researcher Shambhu Upadhyaya. "There are systems that try to do this in
real time, but the problem is it results in too many false alarms." Some
rival computer-security products also feature user profiling, but it's
based on huge amounts of data flowing through entire networks. Upadhyaya
says such detection systems are usually 60% to 80% reliable, whereas
simulation tests indicate the new software would be up to 94% accurate.
One information specialist says, "Other intrusion techniques require
something like looking at audit logs after the damage has already
occurred. The advantages offered by this approach is an intruder with
malicious intent can be identified very early and a system operator can
contain the damage, repair it in real time and shut out the intruder.
This means that systems that have been attacked by an intruder
maliciously might not necessarily be brought down."

PENTAGON TO SUPPLY COMBAT VIDEOPHONES
In an effort to counter hostile propaganda, the Pentagon plans to equip
public-affairs officers with two-way videophones, enabling them to set up
on-the-spot video interviews with frontline military commanders. The
$27,000 Austrian-made Scotty Tele-Transport videophones come in a rugged
briefcase that cradles a laptop computer with video-editing and recording
capability and includes a built-in camera, a keyboard and a pair of
collapsible satellite dish antennas. Television networks have begun using
such equipment extensively in the past year, and the Department of Defense
and U.S. intelligence agencies already own similar devices. "They have
these systems, but they hadn't thought about using it in this kind of way,"
says Lt. Col. David Lamp, a spokesman for the U.S. Joint Forces Command.
"We're finally getting a realization in the world that information is
power." Instead of sitting quietly while enemy forces broadcast claims that
U.S. forces have bombed a hospital or distributed poisoned emergency food
rations to refugees, as happened in Afghanistan, "the best thing to do is
to try to manage it, to use it. Commanders who don't do that, or leaders
who don't do that, they usually end up learning the hard way."

REACH OUT AND TOUCH SOMEONE WITH YOUR CELL PHONE
Within a year, scientists at Immersion say you'll be able to "touch"
someone over your mobile phone. The company has adapted the sensory
technology used in video game joysticks to send physical sensations via
wireless networks to the phone call recipient. The force feedback
technology works by making the phone vibrate in a number of ways. "The
vibration in mobile phones today all feels the same," says an Immersion
spokesman. "It is like a single note on a piano. What we can do is play
multiple notes or combine the notes to make them feel like chords."
Applications currently are focused on enhancing games that can be played
on wireless phones (on a driving game, for instance, you could feel the
engine vibrations and the shifting of the gears), and the development of
"vibe-tones," which are similar to ring tones and play a unique
vibration pattern linked to a specific caller. Immersion has also
produced a series of vibrations designed to express emotion, which could
accompany a text message. The company says the technology would add
about a dollar to the cost of manufacturing a phone and could, in the
future, be adapted for handheld computers.(BBC News 21 Jan 2003)

[Remember, if you "add about a dollar to the cost of manufacturing,
the consumer is likely to have to pay an additional $5, tax included]

Last month the printed stack of Project Gutenberg books
passed the height of the Washington Monument, 555 feet.
This took 6660 books at an average of 1 inch per book.

Since then we have created another 30 feet.

Should we put things like this towards the top?
