Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to only ONE DVD burner, on a laptop
belonging to a personal friend.  If you have a DVD burner
or plan to get one in the next 6 months, please email me,
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November while
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

We are seeking pro bono or very cheap legal assistance to pursue
Project Gutenberg trademark infringers and similar issues.  Please

may need more around December 10.]

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

********

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Send email to
dphelp@pgdp.net
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)


*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 24 weeks of this year, we have produced 1557 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our FIRST 1557 eBooks!!!

         That's 24 WEEKS as Compared to 27 YEARS!!!


With 8,300 eBooks online as of June 18, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.20 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.86 when we had 5387 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 8,000+ books each costing $.66 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 8,000+ books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 8300 eBooks in ~31 Years and 11.50 Months We Averaged
    259 Per Year   [About how many we do per month these days!]
     22 Per Month
     .7 Per Day

At 1557 eBooks Done In 2003 We Averaged
      9 Per Day
     65 Per Week
    283 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

[Editor's Comments In Brackets]


From Newsscan

HOT UNIVERSITY
The University of Twente in the Netherlands may have the largest wireless
"hot spot" in Europe, with wireless network supporting more than 6,000
students and a staff of 2,500 distributed across a 346-acre campus. A
university official says, "First-year students have a laptop with fast
wireless connection and can run heavy CAD design software, send large
images, and so on... Students and staff are quick adopters of these nice
facilities. The flexible way of teaching that this allows also helps with
new students who have experienced new ways of learning at school. They're
not used to classical ways of knowledge transfer anymore." (Cnet 17 Jun
2003) http://news.com.com/2100-1039_3-1017988.html

COMPANIES WORRY MORE ABOUT SPAM THAN HACKERS
Businesses are far more concerned about the rising flood of spam that's
engulfing their networks than they are about run-of-the-mill hackers,
according to a survey of 2,800 silcon.com readers. But the biggest worry is
over virus attacks, with 71% of respondents citing viruses as the biggest
threat to their businesses. Symantec's Kevin Chapman says he's not
surprised by the results. "Spam has now gone way beyond the quick and easy
'hit the delete button and it's gone' solution. It's now a really big
problem. From the employees' point of view it is about productivity and the
sheer annoyance of dealing with all these e-mails. For the employer it is
about bandwidth and other network resources issues." But aside from
productivity and bandwidth concerns, there's another consequence that could
be lurking out there, says Martino Corbelli, marketing director for
SurfControl. "Some of these spam e-mails have completely inappropriate
content which can create serious problems for the employer on a legal
basis. There may be somebody who feels they should be protected from
p*rnographic content, for example, and in some cases they may be prepared
to sue their employer if they feel they are being exposed to offensive
material on the company's network." (Silicon.com 12 Jun 2003)

MICROSOFT SUES 15 SPAMMERS
Estimating that more than 80% of the 2.5 billion e-mail messages sent each
day to customers of its free Hotmail service are the work of spammers,
Microsoft has filed lawsuits against 15 groups of individuals and
corporations it claims are major spammers. Like many Internet companies,
Microsoft is also looking for technological solutions to the problem of
spam. It has already introduced anti-spam software filters on its MSN
Internet access service, and plans to include similar software at the next
release of its Outlook e-mail software. (New York Times 18 Jun 2003)

MACHINES OF COPYRIGHT VIOLATORS MAY NEED TO BE ZAPPED
Senator Orrin Hatch (R, UT) -- who, besides being Chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, is a composer whose royalties were $18,000 last year
from songs he's written -- says that maybe people who keep abusing copyright
laws should get their computers destroyed. That kind of action "may be the
only way you can teach somebody about copyrights. If we can find some way to
do this without destroying their machines, we'd be interested in hearing
about that. If that's the only way, then I'm all for destroying their
machines... There's no excuse for anyone violating copyright laws."

S*X.COM RESTORED TO RIGHTFUL OWNER
The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from cybersquatter Stephen
Cohen, who had hijacked the lucrative s*x.com domain name from its original
owner Gary Kremen, putting an end to six years of legal wrangling. The
ruling, which upheld a lower court's award of $65 million in damages to
Kremen, is viewed by legal experts as a landmark case because it holds
domain registrar VeriSign accountable for allowing the ownership transfer
to take place, based on a forged letter from Cohen. The case is also
expected to set a precedent for treating an Internet address as legal
property -- a designation disputed by VeriSign, which could face fines of
up to $200 million if found liable. Kremen now faces an uphill battle to
claim his award, because Cohen is now a fugitive in Mexico.

SIGN OF THE TIMES: NO ELECTRONIC PINK SLIP
The new CEO of Vodafone has an unusual clause written into his contract --
if the board of directors decides it wants to sack chief executive Arun
Sarin, it will have to inform him by old-fashioned letter or fax. The
contract specifically prohibits firing Sarin via "electronic mail or any
other electronic messaging service." Just call it a sign of the times.

BEST BUY DECIDES MUSICLAND WOULD BE BEST SOLD
Best Buy, the nation's largest electronics retailer, is getting rid of its
Musicland unit, which it purchased in 2001 for $696 million. Industry
observer George Rosenbaum says, "Best Buy recognizes they made a huge
mistake. They've finally conceded they lost over $600 million." Bernie
Hackett, the owner of an independent music store, sums up the situation this
way: "The music industry is being destroyed by the Internet. Die-hard
customers don't shop here anymore because they get everything they need
online. To be honest, if I didn't own a record store, I'd probably do the
same thing." (Washington Post 17 Jun 2003)

RECONFIGURABLE CHIP DESIGN
A coming trend in chip design will be the use of software that can, in an
instant, reconfigure a microchip's circuitry. Paul Master of QuickSilver,
which has created a prototype the chip, says: "Until now, the hardware had
to match the problem. Now we can change that." Possible uses of
reconfigurable chips will include: cell phones that can work anywhere in the
world; portable computers that can wirelessly and automatically connect to
the Internet using the most suitable radio frequency; and consumer
electronics devices that can easily adjust to every new technical standard
in digital sights and sounds. (New York Times 16 Jun 2003)

BIG BROTHER AT THE OFFICE
More than three out of four of the nation's largest companies monitor
employee e-mails, Internet connections and computer files, because bosses
are worried that their employees, instead of working, will use the Internet
for pornography, online shopping, or Internet gambling. George Walls, a
union president in Milwaukee, says that companies "are far more aggressive
than they ever have been in the past. Virtually every minute of every day
they can tell what you are doing. With all the monitoring, it is turning
into an electronic sweatshop." Lisa Ellington, a call center worker, finds
the situation "kind of insulting," and explains: "I am a good employee and
don't have any reason to be stressed out by this. But it is human nature.
You tense up. I pay bills, buy children's school clothes or order flowers. I
know a lot of people did Christmas shopping. It gives you time to multitask
and take care of things." (Milwaukee Journal Sentinenal/SJMN 17 Jun 2003)

MICROSOFT SETTLES IN NORTH CAROLINA
Microsoft has agreed to the terms of a settlement agreement in the
state of North Carolina over alleged anticompetitive practices. Under
the terms of the deal, consumers who bought Microsoft products between
1995 and 2002 can apply for vouchers of between $5 and $10. The
vouchers can be used toward purchases of software, hardware, or
accessories from any vendor. The vouchers could total significant
amounts of money for some larger customers, including companies and
hospitals. The settlement does not apply to state government purchases.
The settlement requires Microsoft to set up an $89 million fund to
cover the vouchers, and half of any unclaimed funds will be given to
disadvantaged public schools.

SUPREME COURT ENDS LENGTHY DISPUTE OVER DOMAIN NAME
The U.S. Supreme Court has finally brought to a close the six-year-old
case surrounding ownership of the sex.com domain name, which was
originally registered to Gary Kremen but was illegally hijacked by
Stephen Michael Cohen. Cohen allegedly sent a forged letter to Network
Solutions (now owned by VeriSign), the registrar for the domain name,
requesting that it be transferred to him. In ruling for Kremen, the
court established that domain names are in fact property and therefore
deserving of the same safeguards against theft as any other property.
Cohen had appealed a lower court ruling that he should pay Kremen $65
million, but the Supreme Court's decision brings those appeals to an
end. As one of Kremen's attorneys said, "There is nowhere else for him
to try to appeal; the judgment is final."

MICROSOFT CUTS OFF IE FOR MACS
Microsoft has announced it will no longer develop new versions of
Internet Explorer for the Macintosh operating system. Microsoft's
Jessica Sommer said that Mac users will be better served by Apple's
Web browser Safari because Microsoft does not have access to the code
for the Macintosh operating system. A final version of Safari is not
yet available, though several beta versions are. Sommer said Microsoft
might continue to offer security and performance upgrades, but "No IE 6
is planned." Microsoft also said it will end development of Internet
Explorer as a stand-alone product.

SPAM NEW VEHICLE FOR COMPUTER VIRUSES
British spam-filtering company MessageLabs said it has detected the
first case of a virus sent by spam. Rather than sending itself to every
address in the victim's address book, however, this virus allows
spammers to use the affected computer to send more spam. Finding the
source of the resulting spam messages would be virtually impossible,
giving spammers a leg up on authorities trying to crack down on the
problem of unsolicited e-mail. Users whose computers have been
compromised by a spam virus would likely not have any idea that their
machines were being used to send spam. "The only thing they might
notice is that their Internet connection slows down a bit," said Matt
Sergeant of MessageLabs.
