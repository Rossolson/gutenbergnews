CONTENTS

* Happy birthday to Project Gutenberg!
* The BookLand project
* Offline catalog update & impact
* Bookshelves still undergoing revitalization
* New eBook listings from May & June 2014


* Happy birthday to Project Gutenberg!

On July 4, 1971, Michael Hart created the first electronic book.  This
was the United States Declaration of Independance, available online at
www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1

As the United States celebrates the 238th year since its founding, now
is a great time to look at the 1350 or so words that launched a
nation.


* The BookLand project

BookLand (www.book-land.ro) is a year-long mobile book fair throughout
Romania.  In 2014 it is aiming to visit and talk to 300,000 high
school students in 23 cities.  BookLand offers free access to eBooks
in constant pursuit of making lecture a relaxing habit.  Their
Web site has a section for free eBooks.
 www.book-land.ro


* Bookshelves still undergoing revitalization

The Bookshelf section has had significant updates (as mentioned
in May).  Please take a look:
  www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Category:Bookshelf


* Offline catalog update & impact

In April 2014, some updates to the format of the XML/RDF offline
catalog replaced the older format.  This has rendered two services
temporarily unable to get updates from the latest eBooks:

  - MARC-format records provided by Adelaide University
  - The custom CD/DVD ISO maker

We hope both services will be updating again soon.  Meanwhile, the ISO
maker has been having difficulties for several months with sometimes
failing to create a viable ISO image (this is the format for a
collection suitable for copying to a CD or DVD disc).  We hope to make
progress on this soon.
