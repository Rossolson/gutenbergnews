Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

Third Request!

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

Statistical Review

In the first 49 weeks of this year, we have produced 2,227 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,518 eBooks online as of December 11, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.53 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $2.38 when we had 4161 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.79 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 6519 eBooks in 31 1/3 Years We Averaged

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

EGYPT CREATES NEW ALEXANDRIA LIBRARY FOR DIGITAL AGE
Egypt's famed library in Alexandria is taking 21st-century form, with
digital copies of nearly every public Web page posted since 1996. The
library has two hundred Hewlett-Packard PCs, and has incorporated a copy of
the Internet Archive developed by Brewster Kahle in San Francisco, donated
to the Egyptians because Kahle was so impressed with their efforts to
reinstate their leadership role in the creation, storage, and retrieval of
knowledge. The Egyptian government has obtained support from a number of
corporate giants, including Microsoft, Oracle, Ericsson and Alcatel, all of
whom will be tenants on a new 300-acre high-tech oasis near the Giza
Pyramids. (San Jose Mercury News 1 Dec 2002)
http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4641662.htm

SURVEY DEBUNKS MYTH OF THE E-MAIL DELUGE
The latest study from the Pew Internet and American Life Project indicates
that reports of massive e-mail volume swamping workers and sapping their
e-mail at work receive 10 or fewer messages on the average day, and
three-quarters reported spending an hour or less daily dealing with e-mail.
Only 6% reported receiving more than 50 e-mails a day, and among those,
only 11% said the volume posed a problem. Most workers who receive a lot of
e-mail have devised ways to manage the load, such as using filters to
automatically sort the mail into folders. "All of the anecdotal evidence
you hear from people out there is, 'I'm so overwhelmed by the volume of
e-mail. The perception comes from the people who are talking most loudly
about it, those few who are most overwhelmed," says Pew senior research
fellow Deborah Fallows. The pattern is different for power users, typically
those in high-level managerial positions at large corporations. Many of
them spend at least two hours daily on e-mail, with the task often stretching
out to four or more hours. Meanwhile, the study found that younger users
(those under 30) are more likely to use e-mail for personal use while at work,
often sending gossip, jokes and chain letters while on the job.(AP 8 Dec 2002)
http://apnews.excite.com/article/20021208/D7NPSN680.html

Although 70% of U.S. households now have the technical option of
subscribing to broadband services, only15% actually do, because many people
whether it is acquired through cable company or phone company. The problem
is an upscale corollary of basic theorem of the digital divide, and is
illustrated by the fact that whereas 28% of households with income above
$100K a year have broadband access, a mere 4% of families with household
incomes under $35K a year have such access. The industry is trying to
reconcile itself to the basic facts of economic life; analyst Daryl
of broadband adoption that is long and steady, rather than a big
revolutionary pop." Which means that most network users will still be using
dial-up connections a long, long time from now. Professor Andrew Odlyhzko
is hardly anything more ludicrous than the fax machine, but it is still
around." (New York Times 5 Dec 2002)
http://partners.nytimes.com/2002/12/05/technology/05BROA.html

[If 15% of the total US households have broadband and only 4% with under
$35,000 incomes have broadband, then 26% of those with over $35,000 incomes
must have broadband. Since $35k is about the median US household income,
meaning half the people have incomes under $35k, while half are over $35k.
Thus, 4% and 26% shares would average to the 15% average of US households.
Why the NY Times would accentuate 28% over $100,000 rather than 26% over
$35k is beyond me, presuming the rest of these figures are still more or
less correct.  The median national income figures are obviously always a
year or two out of date, and may have gone up $1-2,000, of course. . . .]

FIRMS FINED FOR NOT FOLLOWING E-MAIL RETENTION SCHEDULE
The Securities and Exchange Commission has fined five major brokerage firms
(Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Salomon Smith Barney, and
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray) $1.65 million each for failing to keep employee
e-mail for the required retention period. The SEC examines such mail to
find cases in which brokers have rated stocks positively and given it a
"buy" recommendation to the public, while in private correspondence
revealed complete contempt for the same stock. The commission says, "The
record-keeping rules are a keystone of the surveillance of brokers and
dealers by commission staff and the security industry's self-regulatory
bodies." (San Jose Mercury News 4 Dec 2002)
