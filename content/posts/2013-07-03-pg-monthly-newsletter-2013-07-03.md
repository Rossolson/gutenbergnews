* Project Gutenberg's 42nd birthday

Forty-two years ago, in 1971, Michael Hart typed the US Declaration of
Independence into a computer file at the University of Illinois.  On
July 4, we commemorate that event.  We also honor the memory of
Michael, who died in 2011.

An excellent history of Project Gutenberg was written by Marie Lebert,
and is available as eBook #27045:

* Copyright news from Canada

Via Project Gutenberg of Canada's Mark Akrigg, this is a follow-up to
a previous article on the topic.


WHAT AMERICANS (AND OTHERS) CAN DO TO FIGHT THE TRANS-PACIFIC
PARTNERSHIP

In May's newsletter, Greg Newby was kind enough to post an item I had
written on the dangers posed by the Trans-Pacific Partnership "free
trade" negotiations:

  http://lists.pglaf.org/pipermail/gmonthly/2013/000095.html

The TPP would force copyright extensions in Canada and New Zealand.
But it is an attack on Americans as well. For example, it would make
it impossible to roll back the 20-year copyright extensions passed by
the U.S. Congress in 1998 under shocking circumstances.

By the time you read this, yet another round of closed negotiation
will have taken place in Lima, Peru from May 15-24th.  It's unlikely
that you will see any report of this in the media.  So the secret
attack on your rights will continue -- unless you take quick and easy
action to tell your government that they are there to serve the
public, not private interests!


HOW TO TAKE ACTION IN NO TIME AT ALL

The TPP is an attack on the rights of Americans, and Americans are in
the best position to stop the attack.  In no time at all you can send
a message to Congress.  Go to the following Electronic Frontier
Foundation page to learn more about how the TPP harms America, and
click on the red TAKE ACTION button to send a message to Congress:

  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/04/tpp-biggest-global-threat-internet-acta

If you live outside the United States, sign the Stop the Trap petition
-- Americans can also sign it!

  http://stopthetrap.net/


HOW TO TAKE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE ACTION IN VERY LITTLE TIME

The petitions are excellent, but do not focus on copyright terms,
which are of special interest to supporters of Project Gutenberg.  But
it's easy to do just a little bit more: this "little bit" can actually
be enormously effective.  Remember how the one-day Wikipedia blackout
and individual phone calls and emails completely stopped a government
attack on the rights of internet users.  Individual actions count.

In the United States, simply write and/or call your Member of Congress
and Senator telling them that for the United States to use the TPP to
extend copyright durations is an attack on the rights of the citizens
of other countries, and in complete conflict with the principles of
equity and respect for others upon which the United States was
founded.  And tell them that Congress's 1998 20-year copyright
extension was an illegitimate confiscation of the public domain, and
should be repealed immediately, rather than exported to other
countries.

In Canada and New Zealand, contact your Member of Parliament to say
that they must not allow copyright extensions to be forced on your
country by a secret international treaty.  In other TPP countries
(such as Australia and Mexico), tell your elected representatives that
copyright terms should be as short as possible, and should never be
dictated by foreign governments and corporations.

This is a battle that we can win!
