### Project Gutenberg of Canada Release their 500th eBook

"[Forty Years of Song](http://www.gutenberg.ca/ebooks/albani-forty/albani-forty-00-h-dir/albani-forty-00-h.html "Forty Years of Song eBook at Project Gutenberg Canada")" by Emma Albani, first published in 1911. [Emma Albani](http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=7930 "Emma Albani on Dictionary of Canadian Biography") (1847-1930) was the first Canadian singer to gain a worldwide reputation, which is rather something considering the combination of Canada's low population and remoteness for the time period. Think of how much "easier" it was for Piaf. "Easier" quotes because Edith Piaf did not have an easy time, but it was certainly easier for the world to find HER.

### Our 400th Project Gutenberg eBook in Portuguese has just been released

[Novo Dicionario da Lingua Portuguesa](http://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/5/5/31552 "Novo Dicionario da Lingua Portuguesa"), by Candido Figueiredo. Released as PG eBook #31552.
