    Verizon Communications plans to build an undersea, fiber-optic link between the United States and China, partnering with China Telecom, China Netcom, China Unicom, and companies in Korea and Taiwan.<br /> Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2007 and end late in 2008.<br /> Data transport speeds are predicted to reach 10 gigabits per second for individual customers. The new line enhances a lower-speed system that is the sole direct link between the two countries.<br /> <em><br /> USA Today, 18 December 2006</em><br /> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-12-18-verizon-china_x.htm" target="_blank">http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-12-18-verizon-china_x.htm</a>
