* Public Domain Day 2013

Thanks to Duke Law for highlighting what WOULD have become public
domain in the US on January 1, 2013 if copyright term extensions had
not intervened.

  http://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2013/pre-1976

When Michael Hart started Project Gutenberg, January 1 was a great
day.  Every year, items from 75 years previous would enter the public
domain.  We had a schedule of items going into the public domain... in
1998, we had begun to digitize items first published in the US in
1922.  In 1999, we would have started items from 1923.  This was
forestalled by the copyright term extension act of 1998.

Today, it will be the year 2019 before anything new enters the public
domain.  Project Gutenberg is working with partners to fight against
the next extension to copyright, which will surely be a subject of
legislation in the next few years.


* Michael Hart's house is up for sale

The executors of the estate of Michael S. Hart, Project Gutenberg's
founder, would like to announce that Michael's house is now for sale.
The house is located in Urbana, Illinois.  It is a 110+-year old house
with some spectacular features, but in need of some updates, fixes and
care.  For further information:
