<pre>Today marks 1/3 of a century of Project Gutenberg.


I will be sending out several announcements today
about the new Project Gutenberg Consortia Center.

The first few will be extremely brief, while some
that follow should answer questions you may have.

The site answers to 3 domain names, just pick the
the one you like the most:

pgcc.net
gutenberg.cc
gutenberg.us


There are approximately 37,000 files available on
this site, 27,000 of these are HTML files, with a
variety of other formats also included.  The HTML
files should be easily accessible from the search
engine, please let us know of any that are not in
the search engine, graciously loaned to us.  This
search engine is currently being modified to make
it specify it searches Project Gutenberg eBooks.

Another 10,000 or so files are accessible through
a variety of links to sites provided by donors of
the various eBooks.

These eBooks are catalogued as per the preference
of those who donated them, most with one entry to
each book, but many are listed by chapter, and in
some particular cases, even by page, as per those
who donated them.

Please let us know by reply to this email, and to

info@gutenberg.cc

of any ways we can improve your access.

On request, I will provide a single email with an
entire collection of this series of messages, for
those who prefer one long message to several ones
of a shorter nature.

Thank you so much for all the support we received
over the first 33 1/3 of Project Gutenberg.

Press release:


THE FIRST PROJECT GUTENBERG CONSORTIUM CENTER IS OPEN!!!


November 4, 2004


Today, on the one-third of a century anniversary date of
Project Gutenberg, it is my pleasure to announce a site
designed for the exchange of entire eBook collections--

The first of the Project Gutenberg Consortia Centers is
located at a site designated by its initials:  pgcc.net

The mission of the Project Gutenberg Consortia Centers:
to help people legally exchange eBook collections under
the various new copyright laws.

As you may know, different countries had copyright laws
change drastically over the last few years, and we hear
even more changes are coming at the end of this year.

Therefore, we are making this effort to help those whom
these copyright extensions will effect, to insure their
continued abilities to provide free eBooks within rules
of their new copyright laws; such as many EU countries,
and apparently Australia at the end of this year, along
with various other changes we will try to help everyone
keep up with.

We hope to be making similar announcements next year to
let you know about more such sites under the laws of an
assortment of countries worldwide.
