In Australia it is now 1st August 2008 and Project Gutenberg Australia is celebrating its seventh birthday!

In August 2001 Project Gutenberg Australia posted their first book online, "[Animal Farm](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100011.txt "PG Australia, Animal Farm by George Orwell")" by George Orwell – they now have over 1600 titles available for download. Project Gutenbereg (U.S.) only posted their 1,600th title in June 1998 – that's 20 years longer that it has taken PGA!

"_Aussies are perhaps the greatest volunteering nation on a percentage basis_", this is certainly no understatement from Project Gutenberg Founder, Michael Hart. We send our congratulations to all the Aussie's who have volunteered over the years. I'm sure the next seven are going to be even more impressive.
