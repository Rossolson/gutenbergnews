Requests For Assistance:

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czeck by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;.

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

A new mailing list "gut-tv@listserv.unc.edu" has been added.
This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free
eBooks This Week" which highlights the free eBooks posted in the
past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help
write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Correction From Last Week's Newsletter:

the last moment, apparently I counted one too many as the last

Statistical Review

(This number includes the 88 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 34 weeks of the new year, we have produced 1,529 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,826 eTexts online as of August 21th, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.72 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.63 when we had 3806 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.91 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

[This Article Mentioned Project Gutenberg As A Prime Example Of What
Is Great About The Internet]

SLEAZE ON THE NET
Not many Internet companies (the ones still in business) are making any
money, and only a few of them (e.g., eBay and Amazon) stand as exceptions to
that general rule. [We should admit here that NewsScan is also "profitable"
-- but we eat like birds.] Most Internet money is derived from sleaze, phony
products, pyramid schemes, and spam. What should one think about all this?
Science fiction writer Bruce Sperling says that cyberspace is "debasing
itself in front of our eyes," and warns that "we will lose the Internet if
industry has its charlatans, and e-commerce is getting its share. I don't
see evidence that it is more than you would expect, especially in a new
industry." Sleaze even has its champions, especially among those who
participate in such activities. David Marchlak, who created a "voyeur" site
that follows the dorm-room activities of young college women in Florida,
of dollars spent on it every year. We're not forcing it on anybody." Some
thoughtful Internet observers of the Internet, such as Gary Chapman and
Brewster Kahle, suggest that the enormous diversity of content on the
Internet means that that the good outweighs the bad. Chapman (of the
practically every day by something new on the Internet... At this point,
it's almost impossible to characterize what the Internet is like." Brewster
Kahle (founder of the Wayback Machine, which archives the Internet) reminds
three verse of the 'Gilligan's Island' theme song. I don't want my children
to grow up like that." (New York Times 26 Aug 2002)
http://partners.nytimes.com/2002/08/26/technology/26CYBE.html


[What Did I Say About Combining Cellphones and PDAs, etc???  Hee hee!]

VIDEO CLIPS BY CELL PHONE
Japan's second-largest wireless company, KDDI, has developed a service that
will allow subscribers to send and receive videos on their mobile phones,
using a new video camera-equipped phone made by Toshiba. The phone comes
with a secure digital memory card that can store up to 555 five-second video
clips. KDDI president Tadashi Onodera is brimming with optimism about the
light-weight, high-resolution phone, which will be priced in the
switch to high-end and feature-rich handsets." KDDI rivals J-Phone and
Vodafone already have movie e-mail services, but KDDI says it is the first
company to offer clips lasting as long as 15 seconds.
(Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 26 Aug 2002)
http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3940309.htm

BT LOSES BATTLE TO CLAIM HYPERLINK ROYALTIES
In a test case for British Telecom's claim that it owns a patent on
hyperlinking technology, U.S. Judge Colleen McMahon has dismissed BT's
claims, saying that Prodigy's use of the technology did not infringe on
BT's 25-year-old patent. McMahon found several flaws in BT's argument, most
notably that the Internet has no "central computer" as described in the
original patent filing. As part of its defense, Prodigy offered a 1968
video by Stanford University computer scientist Douglas Engelbart
apparently demonstrating hypertext technology, eight years before BT filed
its patent application in the U.S. (BBC News 23 Aug 2002)
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2212203.stm

STOP THE TECHNOLOGY, I WANT TO GET ON
If companies would just stop inventing things a consumer would know what to
do. DVDs are still all the rage, but movie-watchers are now being offered
VHS tapes but provide about twice the resolution of DVDs. Critic Mike
improvement over DVD. It leaves DVD in the dust, as difficult as that might
be for DVD's growing legion of fans to visualize. The difference was so
stunning that after watching D-Theater versions of U-571, Terminator 2, and
End of Days, the DVDs looked as if the lens had gone slightly out of
focus." Sigh. We'll call it progress. (USA Today 28 Aug 2002)
http://www.usatoday.com/tech/techreviews/products/2002-08-27-digital-recorde
r_x.htm

CELL PHONE NUMBER PORTABILITY COULD LEAD TO CHURN SPIKE
A new regulation that would enable cell phone users to take their number
with them when they switch carriers could generate a spike in customer
turnover, or churn, at least in the short term, says analyst Ken Hyers at
but then the pain will diminish. Carriers should accept that rule as
inevitable and move forward." Hyers predicts that about 46% of U.S. mobile
customers will switch to a rival operator in the year following the
regulation's November 2003 implementation. That compares with an estimated
current turnover rate of 30%. Similar rules in Australia, Hong Kong and
parts of Europe have resulted in churn rates increasing by 25% to 50%, says
In-Stat. In addition to the probability of losing customers, wireless firms
will have to face increased outlays of between $900 million and $1 billion
to upgrade their networks and software in order to accommodate number
portability. But telecom analyst Jeff Kagan says the final result could be
a mobile as their primary phone but that is a goal of the industry. Once it
happens, the bottom line is that customers will scream if they have to
change their number. The way to keep customers happy is not to trap them
but to give them a reason to stay." (Reuters 27 Aug 2002)

Headlines From Edupage:

[For Those Who Want To Know Apple's Market Share, Etc.]

GATEWAY TAKES ON APPLE
In an unusual advertising move, Gateway Inc. has launched an ad campaign
that pits its new all-in-one Profile PC against Apple Computer's iMac.
The new ads place a Profile PC next to an iMac, saying the Gateway machine
has better performance and storage and greater selection of software.
Direct comparisons among specific products has been relatively rare in the
PC market, and even more unusual is the Windows versus Apple OS aspect.
However, Gateway and Apple, which each control about five percent of the
U.S. PC market, both want to be the leader in the computer niche for
schools and small businesses.
