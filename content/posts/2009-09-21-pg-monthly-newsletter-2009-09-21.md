<pre>ï»¿The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter--Sep. 21, 2009
eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


39 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring
on December 21, 2012 [some now saying October 11, 2011]

Leaving 3 years 3 months, 13 1/4 seasons or 39 months.

Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions,
such as that there will be affordable petabytes [2021],
and enough eBooks to fill an entire petabyte around the
same time.

eBook Milestones


We just released our 25,000th English Project Gutenberg
eBook as "Merriam-Websters Unabridged Dictionary, 1913"
about a month ago, and we are now coming up on 30,000th
in all languages, under U.S. Copyright Law and 35,000th
created by all Project Gutenberg sites worldwide.  This
is not counting any of the ~75,000 eBooks available via
http://www.gutenberg.cc which have been donated by many
eLibraries outside the Project Gutenberg systems.

In addition, Project Gutenberg of Australia is about to
post its 1800th eBook, and we are coming up on #1500 of
our eBooks in French.


Last month:  Project Gutenberg posted its 25,000th home-
grown eBook: home-grown means not including eBooks given
by the various Project Gutenbergs that are springing up,
including Australia [approaching 2,000], PG of Europe is
approaching 650, PG of Canda is approching 500, and many
more around the world.

All in all, adding up all the Project Gutenberg sites in
toto, not discount duplications, there are 100,000+ book
titles, along with music, movies, audiobooks, etc.

All in all the original Project Gutenberg has produced a
total of 29,660 at the time of this release, meaning the
their total in all 50+ languages they have produced will
be turning 30,000 in about a month.

This larger total includes nearly 1,500 books in French,
about 600 in German, 500 in Finnish, over 400 in Dutch &
Chinese, about 350 in Portuguese, and 250 in Spanish and
the list goes on and on.

If it is languages other than English that interest you:

http://www.gutenberg.cc

where there are over 100 languages represented in a wide
variety of languages and subjects, with about 75,000 all
total, approximately half of which are non-English.

Our 30,000th eBook created under U.S. copyright law is a

Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!


FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The ideal piece around which to center this collection is
one of the 8 megabyte USBs.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the
Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems
and these were OEMed by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular
in a recognizable fashion because their snapon connectors
resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

We received two examples of RAM actually labeled "Flash,"
for the H-P 95 pocket DOS machine from 1991, and a sample
of Fairchild bubble memory, as well, from down under.

Thank you, Mate!



POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.





Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and
totals from PG of Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at

httpwww.gutenberg.cc

Where there are eBooks representing over 100 languages.

As you may have noticed, I cheated by a few days on the
date of this Newsletter so I could include #25,000 so I
should warn you that the monthly totals will be larger,
this month, and smaller next time.

Here is the July emergency Newsletter in toto for archiving.


Extra Edition of the PG Newsletter

I'm sending this out now because I have serious doubts as
to whether I will be able to do this very easily when the
Newsletter is actually due.  This may be the last time on
this hard drive that I actually get booted up, and it was
pretty much just luck that got me this far.

I'll be buying some new computers this week, I hope, with
the hopes that I will be more or less back to normal, but
right now the thing won't even let me make backups as the
USB ports have power, but don't recognize any drives.

I'm actually dialed up on the modem right now.

If any of you have any suggestions as to the best deals I
should be looking at for laptops and netbooks, please let
me know, and please cc:  gbnewby at pglaf.org



The Brief News


We are rapidly coming up to our 25,000th eBook in English
and all suggestions for what title to use are welcome.

This should take place next month.

In addition, we are coming up on our 30,000th PG eBook of
all languages perhaps a month or so after that, so we are
also looking for a great eBook in another language to put
up as #30,000.

We are giving away about 75,000 books per day through the
http://www.gutenberg org server, for ~2 million per month
and the monthly total was often over 3 million per month,
all told over the past 4 years or so.

This means we have given away over 100 million books over
the past 4 years, just through that one site alone.



The World eBook Fair


In addition, over these same four years we have sponsored
The World eBook Fair along with The Internet Archive, The
World Public Library, ebooksabouteverything.org, etc.

http://www.worldebookfair.org handed out a million files,
just on one day alone, July 4, to start up this 39th year
of presenting eBooks on the Internet.

Please note:  this is less than a million eBooks, as some
entries are multi-file in nature.

Traffic has since dropped to about half that, with a very
healthy 50,000 downloads per day of our "best sellers."

In its first year The World eBook Fair gave away nearly a
total of 30 million eBooks, and if the averages have been
at 25 million over the 4 years, that's a 200 million book
total over those two URLs over a 4 year period, or totals
somewhere in that range.

This does not count all the other sites such as Australia
or Canada or PG of Europe, etc.



The Current PG Totals

I'm not sure I have time right now to fill in everything,
with monthly comparisons as I usually do, as I am running
mostly on adrenaline right now and will have to stop soon
to eat, sleep, shower, etc.

Here are the brief reports you can compare to last month:

I will also try to get back online after the fact and try
to redo a real Newsletter with all info as of July 21st.

Here are today's numbers for languages with 200+ eBooks:

Grand total for today: 29326

24725   English en
1442    French  fr
587     German  de
508     Finnish fi
433     Dutch   nl

We have recently been averaging just under 10 books per day
with some very good days that are much better.

If we are lucky, we may do 3,500 to 4,000 books for 2009.

Not to mention the hundreds of books that have been updated
and improved, corrected, etc.


Many thanks to all who have helped us reach our 39th year!
