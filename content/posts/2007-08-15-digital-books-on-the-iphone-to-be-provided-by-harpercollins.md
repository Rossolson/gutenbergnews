NEW YORK (Reuters) reported that publisher HarperCollins said on Wednesday, it will be making 14 new book titles available for Apple's web-browsing iPhone in an effort to extend publishing into digital formats.

Books being made available include; "The Burnt House" by Faye Kellerman, "Now and Forever" by Ray Bradbury and "Obama" by David Mendell.

It has been said before that we need an iTunes equivelent for books. Could this HarperCollins/iPhone venture be the boost eBooks need? I myself am not a huge fan of Apple but if this were to help push eBooks to the forefront of consumers minds, then I'm all for it.

Most of these new books will debut in August and September, with the [iPhone/iPod Touch](/20081031/apple-iphone-touch-stanza-and-project-gutenberg/ "Visit the Apple store for an iPod Touch") compatible versions available at HarperCollins mobile Web site.
