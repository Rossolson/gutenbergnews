* Copyright Term Extensions are Looming!

In our September 2014 newsletter, we wrote about the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP).  This is an international initiative, being
negotiated in secret, which will have far-reaching impacts in many
areas of trade, copyright, and more.

We urge all fans of Project Gutenberg to learn about this initiative,
and speak with lawmakers and others about your concerns.  Spread the
word to your friends and family, who might not be aware of the
downward pressure on wages and job security that the TPP would bring
about.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has an article descibing the
disasterous effects of copyright term extensions, which will be
extended under the TPP to match or exceed copyright terms in the
United States.

Readers in countries with Project Gutenberg affiliates will be
particularly interested in this article.  Australia, Canada, Great
Britain, some nations in Europe, and elsewhere would extend copyright
terms if the TPP were to be enacted.  This would largely halt growth
of the public domain, as happened in the United States in 1998.

The article is here:
