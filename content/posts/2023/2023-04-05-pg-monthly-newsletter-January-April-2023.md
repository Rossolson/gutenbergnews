Apologies for not sending a 2023 newsletter until April 2023. It's been a busy time with Project Gutenberg, and I have incredible gratitude for all the volunteers with Project Gutenberg and Distributed Proofreaders who maintain our pace of new content.


## Survey for Project Gutenberg visitors

You are invited to participate in a Visitor Experience Survey to gather information about the people who use Project Gutenberg's website at <https://www.gutenberg.org>.

After the survey, you are invited to consider participating in an optional visitor experience research project interview to help guide changes to the Project Gutenberg website. Everyone who offers to participate in the interview is eligible for a raffle for a chance to win a $15 gift card. Find the survey here:

## Ad campaign features Project Gutenberg

An innovative advertising agency, The Collective, developed an ad campaign for Project Gutenberg. This campaign highlighted the frequency that classic books like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are turned into movies. It touted benefits of reading the classics in their original form. These classics are great fun to read, and they are freely available from Project Gutenberg. The campaign ran in several newspapers in late 2022.

The three classics highlighted are:
*   Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
*   Frankenstein  
*   Dracula  


## New audiobook app: Audrey

> Audrey (<https://www.listenwithaudrey.com>) is a new audiobook app that pairs an audio reading of classic novels and short stories with an expert literary guide and an illustrator, to make the book as accessible, appealing and enriching as possible.
> 
> For example, Victorianist and author Nat Reeve guides you through Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, or James Joyce scholar Sophie Corser guides you through Dubliners. The Notes from the Guide include author information, insights into the book’s context and reception, photos of its real-life settings, musical accompaniments, and much more. The app also features chapter recaps and character descriptions to help listeners stay on track.We are always looking for the best books in the public domain, and as the Project Gutenberg community is full of classic literature lovers, we wanted to ask if you have any recommendations: a personal favorite, an overlooked or under-rated classic, an absolute must-read?
> 
> We’d love to hear from you. Please write to lucy at hello@listenwithaudrey.com
