## Video: The Big Four

Thanks to Joshua and Laura for work on a new YouTube video:
>  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoKUX5a7T0Y>

This 5-minute video tells the story of the Agatha Christie book, The Big Four. You can find the book in the Project Gutenberg collection:
>  <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/70114>

It includes some fascinating drama in the author's own life, including the mystery of her disappearance in 1926.


## Clio awards for Project Gutenberg ad

A print ad about Project Gutenberg won the prestigious Clio award. You can find the award and a brief writeup at this location:

Project Gutenberg is grateful to "the community," an advertising agency that approached us to offer their services pro bono (free of charge), to help get the word out about Project Gutenberg in a series of print ads.

This year's ad emphasized the value and accessibility of the originally published story - in this case, the story of Dracula. The ad mentions that many movies have been made of classic books, and invites people to read the original.


## 5000 new audiobooks from Microsoft collaboration

Project Gutenberg partnered with Microsoft to make over 5000 new audiobooks. They are freely available athttps://marhamilresearch4.blob.core.windows.net/gutenberg-public/Website/index.html as well as popular podcast download sites.

You can read more about this effort, and see a video of Project Gutenberg CEO Greg Newby talking about it:
