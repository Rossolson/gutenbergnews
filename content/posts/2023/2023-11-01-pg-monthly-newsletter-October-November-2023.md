## TIME recognizes Project Gutenberg's audiobook collaboration

Project Gutenberg was recognized by TIME for our work with Microsoft (and MIT and Google) on some new automatically-generated audiobooks:
>  <https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2023/6324762/project-gutenberg-open-audiobook-collection/>

This is the main page to get started with these new audiobooks:
>  <https://aka.ms/audiobooks>

The page includes a link to the audiobooks collection, a conference paper, and other things including a short video. These audiobooks are freely available from The Internet Archive, Spotify, and other streaming platforms.

It is not clear yet whether the "Best Inventions 2023" will be in print, or just online.

The main collaborators at Microsoft were Brendon Walsh & Mark Hamilton, who approached PG a couple of years ago. Brendon and PG CEO Greg Newby did a talk at the Internet Archive's "Library Leaders Forum" two weeks ago, and this 15-minute talk and demonstration will eventually be posted via <https://libraryleadersforum.org/> or somewhere else at archive.org


## Project Gutenberg's Shakespeare, explained

The works of William Shakespeare have a special role for the Project Gutenberg collection. Founder Michael Hart’s father was a Shakespeare scholar, and Michael collaborated with his father throughout the 1980s to digitize the complete works of Shakespeare.

The result was #100, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare.
   <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100>

Since 1994, #100 has been updated many times to provide an HTML file, to fix typos and other errors, and to be made consistent with the individual works that were published later by Project Gutenberg as separate books.

You can read all about Project Gutenberg's Shakespeare and find links to every English-language Shakespeare play or sonnet on this new Help page:
   <https://www.gutenberg.org/help/shakespeare.html>
