## Project Gutenberg's audiobooks

Last month we mentioned being listed in the TIME "Top 100 Inventions of 2023" for our collaboration with Microsoft to make free computer-generated audiobooks.

Here is more information about the audiobooks at Project Gutenberg is involved with. You can find this information on the main page of <https://www.gutenberg.org>:

> Audio books are a great way to enjoy and share literature. Project Gutenberg no longer adds new audio books to the collection, and suggests these audio book resources. These audio books are all freely available and in the public domain in the US. They may be easily played back on computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices. They may be shared non-commercially, without limitation except in countries where the printed source is still copyrighted. All of the sources listed below are digitizations of texts from Project Gutenberg.
> 
> --> Project Gutenberg’s human-read audio books. 662 titles read by people, sometimes with sound effects or other enhancements. These are from a few different contributors. Visit <https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/categories/1>
> 
> --> Project Gutenberg’s computer-generated audio books. 386 titles from 2003, using text-to-speech automation. These are listenable but relatively low quality compared to today’s technology. Visit <https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/categories/2>
> 
> --> Human-read audio books from LibriVox. LibriVox is a volunteer community that produces high-quality performances that are done by many different volunteers. Visit <https://librivox.org> to find audio books, and also to help create new audio books.
> 
> --> The Project Gutenberg Open Audiobook Collection, as mentioned in the November newsletter. Almost 5,000 titles from 2023, via a Project Gutenberg collaboration with Microsoft and MIT. These use neural text-to-speech technology for more natural-sounding computer-generated audio books. These audio books are also available on major music/podcast platforms as well as The Internet Archive. Project Gutenberg and partners were recognized by TIME for this work in their Best Inventions of 2023. Visit <https://aka.ms/audiobooks>


## The Art of Music, Vol. 03

We invite readers who love music to spend some time with "The Art of Music, Volume 3." Find it here:
>  <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/72303>

There are several other titles by the same author:
>  <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/48933?sort_order=release_date>

These eBooks are about music, and include short musical extracts as sheet music embedded within the book. The great addition by Project Gutenberg and Distributed Proofreaders volunteers is to create machine-readable versions of the sheet music, and include MP3 files to play the music.

This approach to a book about music adds tremendously to the reading and listening experience. It is a great example of how online books can have features not available on the printed page.

Unfortunately the machine-readable scores and audiofiles don't seem to work in the EPUB formats, but the HTML experience is wonderful and most tablets and ereaders can also handle HTML. The landing page at the first link above includes a zipped HTML file that embeds all the images and sound files together.


## Join Distributed Proofreaders

Visit <https://www.pgdp.net> to learn about how to help create some of Project Gutenberg's forthcoming eBooks. Proofreading a page a day is easy, fun, and a great way to help bring literature to the world.
