## Computer-generated audio books

Project Gutenberg collaborated with a team from Microsoft that used their AI-driven text-to-speech technology to make free audiobooks. The initial outcome is 5000+ free audiobooks of Project Gutenberg eBooks.

These have vocalization and pacing that are noticeable improvements over previous generations of automated text-to-speech. They are available for free playback or download from The Internet Archive and several audio distribution channels.
