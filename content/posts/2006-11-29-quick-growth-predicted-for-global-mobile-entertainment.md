  Juniper Research estimates that the global mobile entertainment market is currently worth $17 billion and will grow to $47 billion by 2009 and $77 billion by 2011. The company predicts European and Asia Pacific countries will come to dominate the global market for mobile entertainment. Today, mobile music is the largest sector, followed by "infotainment," which includes sport, leisure, and information products. Juniper expects revenues from mobile games and mobile TV will surpass the music sector by 2011, as will mobile gambling.<em>Silicon Republic, 29 November 2006</em><br /> <a href="http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single7426" target="_blank">http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single7426</a>
