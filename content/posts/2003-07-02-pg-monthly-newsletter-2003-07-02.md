============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

2) Monthly eBook update

NOTE:  GUTINDEX Has Moved to Five Digits!

As we have recently posted our first eBook with a five digit eBook number
(#10701), we have made an adjustment to the GUTINDEXes to accomodate this
change. Basically, the alignment of eBook numbers less than 10,000 have
been moved one space to the right.  This change is also reflected in the
eBook listings below.

3) News

PG on CD

So, you missed the newsletter editor's birthday yesterday. What to buy in a hurry
that's useful and interesting? Well, obviously, as the editor asks for book
tokens every year that's the way to go. Now, what could be better than
a small pile of books to plough through?

Well, how about a HUGE pile?

Yes! you could have the best of Gutenberg at your fingertips all
the time. No dialling in and dropping the line halfway through the download (You
can still do this of course). The Gutenberg CD gives you 558 files for
the princely sum of $19.95 including shipping worldwide! It's not just
books of course, there are movies too.

Whizz along to http://www.simtel.net/spotlights/gutenbergcd.html and
tell Don Watkins we sent you.

Now, of course you can still get everything for free at the usual
address http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg.

Scientific American Supplement

by Juliet Sutherland

"Whether electricity will ever rival steam, remains yet to be proved;
we may be on the threshold of great things. The premature enthusiasm
has subsided, and we enter upon the road of steady progress."
Scientific American Supplement March 29, 1884

Project Gutenberg has just posted its first issue of the Scientific
American Supplement (SAS), which is just the start of many yet to
come. In the time period 1870-1922 Scientific American (SA) was a
weekly periodical. It was joined in 1876 by the Supplement which was
also published weekly. They were, in their prime, the premiere
American science periodicals, covering a wide range of topics that
included the physical and social sciences, medicine, architecture and
design, agriculture, and all kinds of engineering and manufacturing.

I've avoided using the word "magazine" because it is quite
deceptive. Physically, the SAS and SA from this time frame are 28 cm x
40 cm (~11"x16"), with each issue being (usually) 16 pages long. Each
page is divided into 3 columns. The text alone of the issue that has
been posted is ~275K or about 80 pages in 10 point fixed-width
type. Each issue is also heavily illustrated with both line drawings
and steel engravings. The illustrations range from relatively small,
in-column diagrams to amazingly detailed full page pictures. The large
engravings use fine lines and dots to simulate, very effectively, what
we now think of grayscale. Due to the importance of these
illustrations, we are also posting html versions of each issue. But be
warned: the file sizes for the illustrated versions are quite large
(typically 4-6Mb).

Thanks to the friendliness of a local used book dealer, I have access
to a very large number of issues of both publications from the 1860's
through the 1920's. Because he will be reselling them, for the most
part these are individual issues, not bound volumes. So there is a
certain randomness to which issues will appear when. Eventually we
hope to make the entire series of both publications available through
PG. As far as I know, these publications, from this time frame
(1870-1922), are not available in any digital form so PG will be
providing a very unique resource. The issues are being proofed through
DP, with the basic unit of proofing being one column. Come help us
make these available to everyone!

Request for sponsorship

From Ted Garvin

There are some books of historical/literary significance that I would
like to get through ILL (Inter Library Loans). Only one problem (aside
from finding time to scan them, but I seem to manage in that area),
and that is lack of funds.

So this is a plea for sponsorship. Email Ted at garvint at yahoo.com

                    -------------------

Tabloid Scanning Now Available.

Project Gutenberg has purchased a tabloid-sized flatbed scanner,
capable of scanning pages up to 12" by 17" (30cm x 42.5cm). Do you
have a book, magazine, sheet music, or broadside that requires an
oversized scanner?

E-mail Suzanne Shell at shells at pglaf dot org to discuss the
details.

It would be helpful to include the following in your message:
Title/author, Copyright clearance, Time constraints, Format and/or
image resolution needed (and any other special requirements). The
scanner (and Suzanne) are located in North Carolina; get in
touch--we'll figure out how best to handle your project.

Radio Gutenberg Update

http://www.etc-edu.com

The runoffs for DJs have been completed and it looks like "The Fishburne
Files" and "Bugsy" are here to stay. The Fishburne Files will continue to
explore the treasures of the Gutenberg Collection, and to expand Dr. Kula's
ability to give satisfying readings of the broadest possible diversity of
material.

In line with that objective, "The Files" is opening the late June - early July
broadcast series with a new reading of Shakespear's "A Midsummer's Night
Dream". This reading features 22 unique computer voices, continuing
improvement of inflection, a revised Shakespeare Pronounciation guide, and
stereo staging (left-center-right only).

"The Real Dope" will continue to unfold as a live reading, and Bugsy, Radio
Gutenberg's Programmer, is working on a means to provide daily shows of new
books that add 30 minutes or so of material every 3 to 7 days, and provide
multiple means to listen to missed episodes.

A new reading of Robert Sheckley's science fiction short "Bad Medicine" is
coming online soon. Give it a listen, you'll be suprised how far we've come
in the last 6 months! The follow up "replay" to "Bad Medicine" is "The Fall
of the House of Usher.". That's in the way of fixing a mistake ....

Brett was concerned that Shakespeare might not give us programmers enough new
ground to cover, so he's got Plato's Republic scheduled. And "The Iceberg
Express" "Diary of a U-Boat Captain" "When the Earth Shook" and Captain
Cook's Diary's are coming soon.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Please visit the site:
http://www.pgdp.net for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

 If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

 Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

********

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time or
technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Send email to
dphelp@pgdp.net saying that you are interested in post-processing and we
will help you find a project to work on.
