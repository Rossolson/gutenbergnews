Subject: November Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
To: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@pobox.com&gt;
Date: Sun, 27 Sep 1998 12:59:52 -0500 (CDT)


This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, November 4, 1998

[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]

[As previously reported, we WERE going to send this out on October 7th
. . .the first Wednesday in October. . .but we are even a little ahead
of that schedule. . .so we are planning this for Wednesday, October 0,
which is really September 30th.  However, prairienet.org, from which I
mail from, will be down Monday, and perhaps Tuesday, so we have to get
everything mailed out before that scheduled upgrade. . .which means we
are actually posting three Newsletters during the September calendar.]

Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

Here are three addresses you can email:

hart@pobox.com
[which forwards to]
hart@prairienet.com
hart@archive.org
I would try them in that order.

Michael

Project Gutenberg Milestones


We Are Now On All Seven Continents

Our newest Project Gutenberg site is at:
ftp://ftp.is.co.za/text/project-gutenburg/
Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa
This site is FTP only, which most new browsers can handle.
If you need help working with this particular site, email:
'The Internet Solution FTP admin' (ftp-admin@is.co.za)

It has been a greater struggle than you might imagine,
getting sites up in South America, South Africa, and
Australia, but we are now connected!  Our goal is to
have all the Project Gutenberg Etexts easily available
where they are legally in the public domain.  If you
seen any that should not be where they are, please
email me and the site where they are so we can fix it.
If you know of any places that would be willing to put
up mirror sites, or just some of our books, please let
me know, or even if they are willing to put the Etexts
up for download at physical locations.  The more ways
people have of getting books, the better.

***

This is obviously the first time we have posted three Newsletters from
dates in the same calendar month, which should bring you approximately
100 Etexts for your collections this month.  The numbers total 108 but
we have reserved several numbers for Etexts that probably will not get
posted by the time we send this.

I would like to take this opportunity to give my HUGE thanks to all of
the volunteers and our directors, who have been totally outdoing their
normal production for the past two months, and on the new Shakespeare!

During October we plan to post the normal number of 36 Etexts and also
to start on both our new public domain Shakespeare and our revised one
that will update Etext #100 with many corrections.

If we succeed in posting the new Shakespeares, and in doing 36 Etexts,
we should have posted 1667 Etexts by the end of October or November; a
little uncertain as to when the Shakespeares will actually get posted.

This will bring us to 1/6 of our original goal of 10,000 Etexts and we
can reduce our trillion dollars given away price to $6 per Etext if we
manage to give the average Etext to 100,000,000 people.  That's one of
those American trillions. . .not the much bigger kind!. . . .  Another
year and we can reduce that price to $5 per Etext to give $1 trillion,
when we reach for Etext #2000.  We need suggestions for what book will
be #2000.

***

We will be sending out our October "Project Gutenberg Needs You" note,
probably in a week or two. . .but no need to wait to volunteer.

We will be spending much of October and November training volunteers--
so we probably will not be able to keep up this kind of schedule. . .a
guess, however, is that we will still end up about three months ahead,
by the time 1999 actually begins.

***

Just in hours before sending this out:

Around September 8th, our site at Sailor reached the half million
Etext mark for 1998 and expects to reach between 3/4 - 1 million
by the end of the year. . . .  They tell me this is more books
than the average big city library checks out in a year, so let's
also send more people to the libraries; and the librarians, who
are worth their weight in gold!

sailor.gutenberg.org or 198.76.201.198 in Baltimore, MD.
This site provides very fast service for both WWW and FTP service.

***

Oh, I forgot to mention, WIRED is scheduled to have something
about us in their November issue, coming out in about two weeks.
[Usually around the 7th of the month or so]

Here are the 36 Etexts for Februray, 1999, including 4 from March.

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]


&gt;From Edupage:


UNIVERSITIES PUSH PROFESSORS TO RETAIN COPYRIGHTS
There's a growing movement among academicians and their institutions to
retain the copyright on articles published in scholarly journals, rather
than turning those rights over to the publisher as is usual.  The California
Institute of Technology will be hosting a three-month-long discussion of the
subject on an electronic network, beginning Oct. 1.  "It became clear to
me," says Caltech provost Steven Koonin, "that copyright is the linchpin. If
you're going to change that system, copyright is the nexus that you have to
go after."  Other universities now considering turning the tables on
publishers include Yale University and the University of Kansas.  Koonin
says he'd like to see Caltech and its faculty members jointly own the
copyrights to journal articles and license those rights to publishers on a
limited basis.  "The publishers have basically been getting a free good up
to this point -- which is the copyright."  Meanwhile, publishers are not
enthusiastic about the movement, and an Elsevier Science VP says she has
"serious reservations" about a university policy that would require its
professors to retain their copyrights.  (Chronicle of Higher Education 18
Sep 98)

THE CHECK IS STILL IN THE MAIL...
More than 47.4 billion business and personal checks were printed last year,
up 1.4% from 1996.  "Checks are a U.S., Canada and U.K. phenomenon," says a
Citibank VP.  "In the U.S., having more than 12,000 banks and savings and
loans makes it hard to agree on electronic standards, which encourages
checks."  Not only that, but banks benefit from selling all those checks, to
the tune of $1.7 billion last year -- that doesn't include the additional $1
billion they made charging for bounced checks.  And issuing paper checks
enables the banks to keep closer tabs on their customers.  When people move,
one of the first things they do is order new checks.  But all this may be
changing -- a new standard called IFX is due out in February, which will
enable consumers to receive bills online from any vendor, and analysts say
people are much more likely to pay an electronic invoice electronically
(and, conversely, a paper bill with a paper check).  "When checkless
transactions do catch on, the adoption rate will be tremendous," predicts a
Deutsche Bank analyst.  (Investor's Business Daily 22 Sep 98)

NET SURFING VS. CHANNEL SURFING
As people become active surfer on the Internet, do they watch less
television?  A study commissioned by Discovery Networks has concluded that,
as households begin to use the Internet, television use by teenagers tends
to drop but use by everyone else tends to increase.  (New York Times 21 Sep 98)

FREE INTERNET SERVICE IN THE U.K.
British consumer electronics retailer Dixons Group and telecommunications
firm Energis are teaming up to provide a free Internet service to citizens
in the U.K.  Users will not be required to pay any registration or usage
fees, but will be charged $1.68 a minute for technical support.  The move is
expected to force other Internet service providers in that country to
reevaluate their pricing structures.  (Wall Street Journal 23 Sep 98)
