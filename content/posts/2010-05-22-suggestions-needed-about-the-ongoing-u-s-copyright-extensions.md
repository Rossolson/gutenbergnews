U.S. COPYRIGHTS TO BE EXTENDED TO 115 YEARS, DECADE BY DECADE FROM THE ORIGINAL 14 YEARS!

THE SUPREME COURT SAYS IT NEVER HAS TO STOP!!!

Suggestions are more than welcome how to publicize this upcoming event before it even starts to happen!!!

Apparently everyone is keeping silent about the various copyright extensions coming up in Canada and the U.S.

In just a few years yet another bill will be introduced in the U.S. Congress to extend copyright that has quite literally been extended from 14 years to 115 years.
