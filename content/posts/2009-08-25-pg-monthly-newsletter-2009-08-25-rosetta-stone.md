<pre>Project Gutenberg Monthly Newlsetter
[gmonthly] Rosetta Stone as eBook


We are exploring doing something on the order of public domain translations of
the various Ancient Greek, Coptic, Hieroglyphs et al from The Rosetta Stone.

Please advise if you would be interested in helping.


We put this in Preprints:

  http://preprints.readingroo.ms/rosetta/

Including a README.TXT

Original source:

  http://books.google.com/books?id=Q5Ow9Ub_BIgC&oe=UTF-8

it's also at archive.org, with raw OCR


Many thanks!!!
