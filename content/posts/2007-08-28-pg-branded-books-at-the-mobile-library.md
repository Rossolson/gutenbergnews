<a href="http://handybibliothek.qioo.de/books_en.php" target="_blank">Die Handybibliothek (The Mobile Library)</a> now has some PG branded books (in English) available on their website. These are FREE books availbe in the JAR and JAD formats. With the later you can download them "over the air".

It would be great if anyone with a WAP enabled phone could check them out and let us know how they are.
