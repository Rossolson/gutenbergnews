eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Since 1971

Part 3

----------------------------------------------------------------------

REMINDER: GUTINDEX eBook numbers now have five digits.!

As we have recently posted our first eBook with a five digit eBook number
(#10701), we have made an adjustment to the GUTINDEXes to accomodate this
change. Basically, the alignment of eBook numbers less than 10,000 have
been moved one space to the right.  This change is also reflected in the
eBook listings below.

Note:  this listing best viewed with a fixed-width font, such as Courier New
        or similar.

=============================================================================
=           [ Here Are The Updated Listings For This Past Week ]            =
=============================================================================

TOTAL COUNT as of today, Wed 27 Aug 2003:   9,149 (incl. 267 Aus.).

Last week the Total Count was 9,079, including 263 at PG of Australia.
This week we added 71 new (incl. 4 at PG of Australia); however, we had to
remove one posted previously, for a net gain of 70 for the week (details
below).

RESERVED count:   39

A "?" at the beginning of the filename indicates that the eBook is
available in both 7-bit (plain text) & 8-bit (accented) versions.

=-=-=-=[ CORRECTIONS, REVISIONS AND NEW FORMATS ]=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, xxxxx11.txt, and
    prior to 1998, occasionally a new eBook number.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, xxxxx10a.txt, as
    well as a new eBook number.
