## Project Gutenberg is 45 years old!

July 4, 2016 was the 45th birthday of Project Gutenberg.  On July 4,
1971,founder Michael S. Hart typed the U.S. Declaration of Independence (now
available at www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1).  Michael worked tirelessly to make
the world's great literature freely available in electronic form.  Today,
eBooks are a mainstay of the human experience with literature and content of
all types.

## Help Wanted: Web/Database

Project Gutenberg's main Web site, www.gutenberg.org, could use some
modernization and upkeep.  If you have a strong background in complex Web
sites, metadata, databases, proxy servers, PHP, Perl, Ruby and the other
technologies that keep Project Gutenberg running, please get in touch with
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby at pglaf.org> to see whether you could use your skills and
energies to benefit Project Gutenberg.  Past experience indicates that 10+
hours per week is needed to make progress.

## Join Distributed Proofreaders!
