##  Video about Three AI Initiatives

Here's a 19-minute online presentation Professor Ilana Kingsley made for the Pacific Northwest Library Association annual conference.

It’s about three artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives that PG has undertaken in the past couple of years. First is the audiobooks, followed by browsing categories & book summaries. Also a bonus application that is rather neat.

## New Dyslexia-Friendly Reader Available from Howard Forge Press

From Dr. Greg Buhrman:

Hi everyone, I made this reading tool for my daughter, who is dyslexic, because she doesn't like to read and I wanted her to read my book. It works great and she loves it. I think everyone should read, and I am interested in lowering the barriers to reading for everyone.

You just load any plain text (.txt) file and you can adjust font type (including OpenDyslexic), font size, line spacing, text color, and background color. The adjustment tools are very intuitive sliders and should be good for young and old readers. The reader runs entirely in your browser—no installation and no internet connection are required after downloading.

You can try it immediately using our Live Demo or download a copy to use offline:

## Chat with an AI About Books

Thanks to https://bringthebooktolife.com/ you can have a focused discussion with an artificial intelligent tool about two of Project Gutenberg's beloved books.

* Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
* Frankenstein; Or, the Modern Prometheus

You can ask questions and engage in dialog at a detailed level for these books. For example, you could ask about the significance of the Queen in Alice. You could discuss the plot and characters from Frankenstein.

This is an experimental tool that is intended to showcase how human readers can have a dialog about literature with an AI tool.
