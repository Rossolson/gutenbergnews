## Seeking Help for a Website Accessibility Statement

Project Gutenberg has not had an accessibility statement for <https://www.gutenberg.org>, and we were recently reminded of this.

If you have expertise in writing an accessibility statement for a website, and might be able to help draft one, please get in touch by return email.

Here is a website linking to many accessibility statements (select the blue icon next to each collection):

## Join Distributed Proofreaders

Visit <https://www.pgdp.net> to learn about how to help create some of Project Gutenberg's forthcoming eBooks. Proofreading a page a day is easy, fun, and a great way to help bring literature to the world. There are many different roles for the different steps involved in digitizing a printed book to make a Project Gutenberg eBook. Beginners are welcome, and there is an online tutorial to get started.
