## Project Gutenberg turns 54!

On July 4, 1971, Michael Hart had the idea of using a computer to read and enjoy literature. This innovation led to the creation of Project Gutenberg, which continues to thrive today.

You can read more about the history of Project Gutenberg in our 50th anniversary writeup:

## New Mirror Site: Old Dominion Universitya

Project Gutenberg's collection is resilient to accidents or mischief, and one of the ways we have done this is to make it easy for sites to have a copy of all the collection.

We welcome Old Dominion University, in Norfolk Virginia, with new Project Gutenberg mirrors:
