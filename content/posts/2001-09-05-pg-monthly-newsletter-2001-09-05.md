We Made Our Goal 100 Etexts Per Month For The First Two Months!

Actually. . .we have done 213 NEW Etexts since July 4th,
when we first officially announced the 100 per month goal!
[_I_ didn't think we would do more than 86 per month]  WOW!!!

We Are On Schedule To Do 100 Etexts Again This Month!
Thanks To Project Gutenberg Of Australia!!!

September Will Only Have Four Wednesdays, So We Need To Work Harder.

LISTENING TO MOVEABLE TYPE
A column about listening to classical music on the Internet, "The
Music of the Web" on San Francisco Classical Voice (www.sfcv.org) has
discovered Project Gutenberg, and what it can do for those interested
in books about music.

***

We STILL need a volunteer in North Dakota to be our legal presence there.
No reply from last request. . .please ask your North Dakotan friends.

We need people in the following countries to handle "life +50" books,
such as 1984 and Animal Farm, by George Orwell, and more. . . .
We are hoping some people in these countries will make Etext sites.
WARNING!!!  Canada is hiding it, but they are contemplating moving
to "life +70". . .so if you want to get these and pass them on in
a legal manner. . .now is the time!!!  We have a site starting up
in Australia, so let me know if you would like to help it start!

Someone sent me a beautifully marginated message outlining some
proposals to work with Project Gutenberg Etexts, and I have not
been able to find the message again to reply. . .please resend!
