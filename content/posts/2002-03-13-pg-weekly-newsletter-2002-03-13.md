- Requests And Announcements For Our Volunteers


PG is posting the first three in a series of files containing public domain
classical music.  Geof Pawlicki is working on these, and Project Gutenberg
has received a grant from the Vital Spark foundation to facilitate the work.

For now, the files will only be posted in the proprietary .MUS format.
However, we intend to add different markup and possibly MIDI files of
the same music as the project moves forwards.

Subject: A DAY IN THE READING LIFE OF AMERICA

At BOOK Magazine, we are putting together an article called A DAY IN THE
READING LIFE OF AMERICA for our July/August All-American issue.

The article will take one 24-hour period--APRIL 5-- and criss-cross the
country in search of the best stories about America's reading life.
We will be talking to book packers in Jefferson City, MO, book destroyers
in Lebanon, TN. We will be visiting the night watchman at the Library of
Congress, going backstage to the Goodman Theatre in Chicago with Brian
Dennehey, sitting in on a story meeting with Terry Gross at Fresh Air,
talking with the homeless denizens of the Seattle Public Library.

We would very much like to have some Project Gutenberg volunteers at work as
part of this article. Please forward this to your list and let's see if we
can do some paradigm-shifting.

David 2   Goliath 0

On Friday, The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
UNANIMOUSLY affirmed Judge Stein's July 11, 2000 ruling denying Random
House's request for an injunction to stop RosettaBooks from publishing
electronic editions of the works of Kurt Vonnegut, William Styron and
Robert Parker.

This marks the second time that Federal Courts have denied Random
House's request and bolstered RosettaBooks position that Author's own
the electronic rights to their works and are free to convey those "e"
rights to RosettaBooks, or any other publisher they may choose.

This is another important victory for Authors, Agents and all those with
a vested interest in the development of a dynamic ePublishing/eReading
market place unencumbered by the baggage of the physical publishing
world. The development of eReading over the next few years would have
been very different had the court held, as Random Hose seems to claim,
that "e" rights to all physically published works are controlled by physical
publishers who are struggling to force fit business models to the electronic
world to emulate the models they use in their physical empires.

RosettaBooks prides itself as an innovator and looks forward to a rapid
development of the Brave New World of eReading.

- Information About Mirror Sites

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Choose a mirror of the Project
Gutenberg collection near you.

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

&lt;http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;
or
&lt;ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.

Note that updated etexts usually go in the original directory of
their assigned year of publication  (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 02/27/02**:  4,668
(This number includes the 50 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

In the first 8 weeks of the new year, we have produced 376 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1995 to produce our *FIRST* 376 eBooks!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,668 eTexts online as of February 27, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.14 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.12 when we had 3209 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.98 less a year later???

E-PUBLISHER WINS ROUND TWO IN COURT
E-publisher RosettaBooks won a second legal round against Random House when
a three-judge panel unanimously upheld an earlier ruling rejecting Random
House's request for a preliminary injunction against Rosetta. RosettaBooks
is selling electronic versions of Kurt Vonnegut's "Cat's Cradle" and seven
other old Random House titles. RosettaBooks had reached contractual
agreements with the authors or their representatives regarding the rights
to electronic publishing, but Random House has argued that electronic
rights are not implicit because e-books are simply another version of a
paper book. A RosettaBooks victory in the case would open the doors for
hundreds of old titles to become available in electronic versions.

FTC CRACKS DOWN ON SPAM
A U.S. District Court, acting at the request of the Federal Trade
Commission, has closed down the U.S.-registered Web sites of three
U.K.-based companies of sending unsolicited commercial e-mail message (or
"spam") to sell about $1 million worth of phony Web addresses such as
".usa," ".sex," and ".store" for $59 each. The Web sites closed were called
www.dotusa.com, www.dotsex.com, and www.dotstore.com. The defendants say
they are denying the allegations and are appealing the ruling. An FTC
official says: "These scammers conned consumers in two ways. They sent
deceptive spam, and they sold worthless Web addresses from their Web sites.
By closing down this operation we're sending a strong signal: We will not
tolerate deceptive spam." (New York Times 12 Mar 2002)

WILL AOL SWITCH TO NETSCAPE BROWSER?
When AOL acquired Netscape in 1999 it surprised everyone by continuing to
offer Microsoft's rival Internet Explorer browser to AOL users. But
CompuServe, which is part of AOL Time Warner, is now testing a new version
of Netscape, thereby signaling that AOL is planning to switch its 33
million users away from Internet Explorer. Giga Information Group industry
analyst Bob Enderle says, "They are planning to take a good chunk of market
share from Microsoft." A Microsoft spokesman was philosophical and
condescending: "The real losers will be AOL users who will now be using
inferior technology." (Bloomberg/Washington Post 11 Mar 2002)
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10789-2002Mar11.html

SUN SUES MICROSOFT FOR DAMAGES OVER JAVA
Sun Microsystems has filed a new lawsuit against Microsoft, alleging that
Microsoft's business practices damaged the market for Sun's Java
programming language. It also alleges that Microsoft kept more than 20
technologies secret, preventing Sun and other server makers from
incorporating the features needed to maker their servers work with
Microsoft's software. Sun's suit follows an earlier filing in 1997, which
focused on a contractual dispute over Microsoft's licensing of Java. The
two companies eventually settled out of court. This time around, however,
Sun is seeking, potentially, billions of dollars in damages in addition to
an injunction that would require Microsoft to distribute the latest version
of Java, to disclose technical information so that other companies can
write compatible software, and to cease bundling some Microsoft products.
The Sun suit follows similar suits recently filed by AOL Time Warner and Be
Inc. (Wall Street Journal 11 Mar 2002)

SLOUCHING TOWARD THE PAPERLESS SOCIETY
How far as we from becoming a paperless society? Still pretty far, but
financial institutions are certainly heading in that direction. Some
companies, such as Datek, now charge a fee for each trade confirmation on
paper; others, such as E*Trade, issue only electronic statements unless
customers specifically request paper ones. Still, many companies are
testing the temperature before getting in the water, and a Wells Fargo
executive says, "At this point we are still focused on allowing customers
to choose the option they are most comfortable with"; the company, along
with companies such as Bank of America and Vanguard Group are encouraging
paperless accounts but not making them mandatory. One problem is that some
institutions still make the process a hassle, and one mortgage company loan
processor says that at least four banks have told her that loan applicants
must have original statements going back two months: "Lots of people get
really angry, saying, 'Why can't I just fax you what's on the Web?'" (San
Jose Mercury News 12 Mar 2002)

[Not to mention the HUGE pressures toward etickets on airlines,
even before 911. . .even if you were willing to pay an extra $10.
The same is now happening with reference librarians, who only 5-10
years ago were quite unanimous in their refusal to do e-reference,
but now try to give you a URL in response to your question, without
even asking if you have access first.  This during the very first
year in which 50% of U.S. households have Internet access.]
