NEWS HEADLINES

 * Borders and Sony partnership with new online store
 * Harlequin to release all its titles in eBook format!


FEATURED NEWS
-------------

WHAT SHOULD BE THE 25,000TH PG EBOOK?

There are only 250 eBooks to go before the combined Gutenberg projects reach
the quarter century! Project Gutenberg U.S. currently has 22,716, while the
unique posts to Project Gutenberg Australia, Europe and Canada have 1,555,
67 & 26 respectively. Add in the 386 PrePrints and we currently have 24,750
total eBooks in the PG archives.

The magic number is likely to be reached within the next couple of months and
we would like you to put forward your ideas on which eBook should be named
the '25,000th Project Gutenberg eBook'.

This can be from any of the four projects (US, AU, EU and CA), but remember,
it must be out of copyright within that region and ready to be released
at that time.

Send all your ideas A.S.A.P. to PG-News: editor [AT] gutenbergnews.org

Best of Luck!

-- Ed


GUTENBERG ARTICLE WRITERS WANTED

Since my relocation to Germany I'm struggling to find as much time to
research and put together interesting articles for the newsletter, so I'm
putting this request out for volunteers.

You will not be expected to write dozens of articles per week (although you
are welcome :), but if there were just a handful of people writing one per
week or fortnight, this would really help to provide more interesting
content for the newsletter.

Back in August, Marie Lebert wrote the excellent 'The @folio Project' article
and has indicated that she may have one or two more over the coming months.
You could join her and help the PG Newsletter become more than just a stats
listing.

If you're interested please email me: editor [AT] gutenbergnews.org

I look forward to hearing from you.

-- Michael Cook [Ed]

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
