<pre>This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, August 16, 2001

          This extra edition is to announce and celebrate

   !!!!!!!The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation!!!!!!!

*Here are the details, followed by the normal Newsletter information*


    For several years Project Gutenberg had the generous support of
Benedictine University and Carnegie Mellon University.  For a few years,
each adopted the Project as a sponsored research project.  They solicited
donations and paid a modest salary to Michael Hart as a research professor
dedicating all his time to getting free etexts on the net.  Thus, Michael
was able to devote 100% of his time to coordinating everything and doing
whatever was needed to keep turning out Project Gutenberg Etexts,
and distributing the free etexts so many volunteers worked on,
so the widest possible audience could partake of them.

However, Benedictine University and Carnegie Mellon University are no
longer supporting Project Gutenberg as sponsored research. They have
asked that no further donations be made out or sent to Project
Gutenberg/CMU or Project Gutenberg/IBC.  We have been told that any
donations received made out to these universities should be returned
with the explanation they are no longer sponsoring the project.

The time has come to be supported by a foundation dedicated solely to
preserving the future of free Etexts as envisioned in Project Gutenberg
and helping to reach the goal of 10,000 etexts as soon as possible.

A few key people need to be employed at modest salaries and many more
volunteers must be found and their work coordinated to reach the goal
of 10,000 free etexts.  So a completely new Foundation, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, has been formed and is in the
process of obtaining recognition from the IRS as a tax exempt public
charity.

Donations are needed more than ever!  However, along the way it has
been necessary to learn far more about non profit law than most people
ever want to know.  We are going to have to abide by very strict laws
and regulations, file many forms and pay registration fees in several
states to make sure everything is done properly and legally.

Until we get some more of this red tape completed, we have to make sure
requests for support are directed only to people in states where it is
legal for the Foundation to raise money.  Presently, contributions are
only being solicited from people from:  Texas, Nevada, Idaho, Montana,
Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota, Iowa, Indiana, and Vermont.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in additional states.

These donations should be made out to the:

"Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"

and sent to our new mailing address:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655

*******And Now The Normal Project Gutenberg Newsletter Follows*******


Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*


With 2820 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.55 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.
*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

This "cost" is down from $3.60 when we had 2775 Etexts on August 2
This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2650 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts in April

Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by 45 cents???


Proving our humanity is just the first step.
It will be demonstrating it time and again
that will revolutionize our world.

There is a Hungarian etext project much like the Gutenberg,
which can be found under the address

(it can be a bit slow if you are viewing it from outside Hungary).
Please let us know if you manage to contact anyone there, we would
LOVE to do Etexts in Hungarian!

Notes from News Scan and Edupage



INDIA IS DEVELOPING A $200 "SIMPUTER"
India's hardware industry is planning a 9,000-rupee (US$200) "simputer" to
extend computer use to the masses by making PCs as inexpensive as a color
televisions. And the Indian government has been moving aggressively to
expand computer and Internet usage, by ending a state monopoly on the
Internet, taking similar action with respect to long-distance telephony,
allowing private firms to set up landing stations for undersea fiber optic
cables linking to Internet gateways, and creating a new legal framework to
enable e-commerce. (Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 15 Aug 2000)

LINUX APPLICATIONS GROUP TO COMPETE AGAINST MICROSOFT OFFICE
Supported by IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and other major computer
companies, a group of Linux software developers has created something
called the Gnome Foundation, which is offering a set of software standards
for a common software environment in which to create a viable but free
alternative to Microsoft's Windows operating system, a unified desktop user
interface, and a set of productivity programs (also free) to compete
against Microsoft's Office suite. Sun has decided to adopt the Gnome
desktop system for its Solaris operating system. One developer in the Gnome
Foundations says: "A year ago, we were missing the last mile. But at the
end of this year my Mom could install Helix Gnome and Sun's StarOffice and
have a total office environment." (New York Times 14 Aug 2000)
