.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

=============================================================================
                        [ This Week's Other Stuff ]
=============================================================================

This week, elucidation comes from the inimitable David Widger, who sends
along the following "clarification" regarding the dates of the various
Pepys' Diaries:

Note: The dates given in Pepys' Diaries are confusing to readers.  The
months of January, February and most of March are designated as in two
years: for example January 1668/1669.  By our present method this is
January 1669.  In the 1893 edition of "Pepys" edited by Wheatley he
explains:

"The year did not legally begin in England before the 25th of March until
the act for altering the style fixed the 1st of January as the first-day
of the year, and previous to 1752 the year extended from March 25th to
the following March 24th.  Thus since 1752 we have been in the habit of
putting the two dates for the month of January and February and March
1 to 24 in all years previous to 1752.  Practically however, many persons
considered the year to commence with January 1st as it will be seen Pepys
did.  The 1st of January was considered as New Year's Day long before
Pepys's time.  The fiscal year has not been altered, and the national
accounts are still reckoned from old Lady Day, which falls on the 6th of
April."

Henry B. Wheatley, F.S.A. 1893
