## Cory Doctorow Understands Copyright

Author Cory Doctorow has made a number of contributions to the Project Gutenberg collection (see: <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/3826>).  He was an early proponent of making his books freely available for redistribution, under a permissive license.

"The Grand Reopening of the Public Domain" was a conference and celebration of the end of the 20-year hiatus on growth of the public domain in the US. Cory gave the closing keynote, which you can watch in this 25-minute video:

>   **Closing Keynote For Grand Reopening Of The Public Domain**
>   <https://archive.org/details/ClosingKeynoteForGrandReopeningOfThePublicDomainCoryDoctorowAtInternetArchive_201901>

Among other things in the presentation, he describes how "grifters" have taken elements of The Commons - which is owned by everyone - and instead restricted ownership to just a few. In his view, Locke was a "thinkfluencer." There is no online transcript yet, so watch or listen to learn more.


## Marie Lebert's 15-year Research Project on eBooks (2000-2016)

Dr. Marie Lebert spent years writing about eBooks, including a deep focus on Project Gutenberg's history, purpose, and ambitions. Marie's updated essay describes the struggle of following one's passion for discovery and understanding, without financial support:

You can find her writings in Project Gutenberg: <http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/l#a32388>

Writings based on interviews with founder Michael Hart are featured in the "About Us" page: <https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:About>

Project Gutenberg is grateful for Dr. Lebert for years of effort to study and communicate the role of electronic books in society.


## The US is Still Celebrating the Growth of the Public Domain

In 1998, when the annual growth of the public domain in the US was put on hiatus, Project Gutenberg mourned. At the time, copyright term lengths were not a frequent topic of conversation. Today, though, it seems there is great awareness that growth of the public domain is important in many ways.

In the start of 2019, people celebrated the addition of many books and other items to the public domain in the United States. Project Gutenberg has already made some books that were published in 1923 available at <https://www.gutenberg.org>

Here is one of many articles that highlights some of the treasures that are now free from copyright protection, and therefore owned by the people:

## BookView from Pictoscope

Here is something we heard about, of potential interest to newsletter readers:
  
>   "BookView visual discovery service, created in 2014 by Pictoscope LLC, has the power to transport users from an image into a book. Library patrons and researchers can see inside historical digitized collections, exploring them through the amazing art, illustrations and visual content hidden within their pages. As book collections around the world are converted from three-dimensional objects into two-dimensional electronic texts, some of the wonder of exploring large collections can be lost or diminished. BookView hopes to bring back the wonder of exploration for future generations by allowing readers to visually explore vast openly accessible collections of historical books. Online at <http://pictoscope.org/>"


## Website Redesign Project

Project Gutenberg invites design ideas and input for Project Gutenberg's Web site and eBook landing pages, such as <https://www.gutenberg.org> and <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100>

Send an email to Greg (simply by responding to this newsletter), or you can join the gutvol-d email discussion list via: <https://lists.pglaf.org/>
