## Forty-eight+ years of eBooks! #60000 published

On July 4 1971, Michael Hart created the first eBook. Project Gutenberg continues today, in its mission to encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks.

On July 29, 2019, Project Gutenberg published our eBook #60000, <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60000>. (This is not actually our 60,000th eBook, since there are a few gaps in the sequence.) It's a wonderful book, with many photos and illustrations:

>   The Living Animals of the World, Volume 1 (of 2)  
>   by C. J. Cornish et al.  
>   <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60000>

Thanks to producers Chris Curnow, Keith Edkins and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at <https://www.pgdp.net> (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive).


## Cataloging: Mission Accomplished

Super-volunteer Joyce has been working on the cataloging of Project Gutenberg works, for several years. Cataloging involves providing correct information for the 'bibrec' tab in any eBook (for example, see <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28885> and select the 'bibrec' tab).

This includes birth and death dates of the creators (author, illustrator, etc.) when known, as well as subject cataloging and categories. From the bibrec tab, you can browse by categories or subject, to find other eBooks of interest.

Thanks to Joyce for leading this effort!


## We have indexes!

Are you interested in learning more about books by some of Project Gutenberg's top authors? Long-time contributor Dr. David Widger has created indexes for 208 of the most read Project Gutenberg authors, with hyperlinks to their book's contents in the PG collection.

The easiest way to find the indexes is from this Author page link: <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/1961>

Thanks to Dr. Widger's work, wost of the popular authors with more than one eBook in the collection now have an index. These are updated from time to time, since there are additional publications for some of the authors over time.


## Browsable list of all eBooks

Some readers might be interested in <http://gutenberg.noemata.net/>. This is a single very long web page that list author, title and eBook # along with a link to every Project Gutenberg eBook.

It is searchable and sortable. Thanks to Bjørn Magnhildøen for making this interface to the Project Gutenberg collection.


## The Multilingual Web

Author and translator Marie Lebert, who has written about Project Gutenberg (in the "About us..." section of <http://www.gutenberg.org>) has a new 70-page paper that may be of interest to many fans of Project Gutenberg.

This is "The Saga of the Multilingual Web," available online at <https://archive.org/details/BooksAndArticles_201601>

It covers many aspects of the Web's capabilities and activities to support multiple languages.


## Website Redesign Project

The Project Gutenberg website redesign is ongoing, and we will be testing new functions and methods this summer.

Ideas are still welcome. Send an email to Greg (simply by responding to this newsletter), or you can join the gutvol-d email discussion list via: <https://lists.pglaf.org/>


## Join Distributed Proofreaders
