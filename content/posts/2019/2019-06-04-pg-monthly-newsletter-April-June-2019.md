## Woman Suffrage eBook

Project Gutenberg joins in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, passed by Congress June 4, 1919 (ratified on August 18, 1920). This is the amendment that gave women the right to vote.

The newest of our eBooks on woman suffrage is our #59675: <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59675>, which is an index to _The History of Woman Suffrage_, edited by Susan B. Anthony and others. Thanks to Dr. David Widger, eBook producer extraordinaire, for his effort to bring this eBook to life.

Here are two Subject links to find other titles on related topics:
