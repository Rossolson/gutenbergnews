## Welcome to a New Year of the Public Domain!

Project Gutenberg is pleased that many books newly entered the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2019.  Your humble editor remembers when this was annual occurrence for Project Gutenberg, until 1998.  It's great to again be able to celebrate the annual growth of the public domain.

Our first new eBook for 2019 was first published in 1923.  You can read it here:  
>   _The Prophet_, by Kahlil Gibran  
>   <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/58585>

During 2019, we will continue to digitize and freely redistribute the literature of 1923 and earlier.  If you would like to help, visit Distributed Proofreaders, as described below.
