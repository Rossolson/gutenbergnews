*Project Gutenberg's *Monthly* Newsletter for Wednesday, May 2, 2001*

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*


We are still testing doing the Newsletters on a weekly basis. . .but I
have only received ONE email requesting bi-weekly and NONE monthly, so
I am preparing to move completely from monthly to weekly on July 4th--
so only two more monthly Newsletters to go though I may keep statistic
files for monthly release as a separate message.

This month we have managed to reach #3481 for a "cost" of $2.87 per copy
to have given away our goal of $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars]
with a total of 864 Etext titles we have presented from last year to now.
[Yes, this includes 13 months of work announced in this calendar year.]
Our 100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population.


This "cost" is down from $2.94 when we had 3400 Etexts on April 4
[This was the month we released two full Newsletters at one time]
This "cost" is down from $3.00 when we had 3333 Etexts on April 4
This "cost" is down from $3.10 when we had 3225 Etexts on March 7
This "cost" is down from $3.17 when we had 3150 Etexts on February 6
This "cost" is down from $3.23 when we had 3100 Etexts on January 3, 2001
This "cost" is down from $3.33 when we had 3000 Etexts on December 6, 2000
This "cost" is down from $3.40 when we had 2940 Etexts on October 18/Nov 1
This "cost" is down from $3.48 when we had 2870 Etexts on September 3
This "cost" is down from $3.55 when we had 2820 Etexts on August 16
This "cost" is down from $3.60 when we had 2775 Etexts on August 2
This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2650 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts on April 5


Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by $1.05
in a period of only one calendar year???

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02
or
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.

Here is a list of the Etexts posted since last month.


We have REreleased significantly corrected versions of:

Jan 2002 The Boss and the Machine, Samuel P. Orth          [bossmxxx.xxx]3040
Version 11
Jan 1992 O Pioneers!  Willa Cather  [Cather #1]            [opionxxx.xxx]  24
Version 12
Jan 2002 Real Soldiers of Fortune, Richard H. Davis   [#31][resofxxx.xxx]3029
Version 11

***

And these are the new Etexts we have posted in the last month
for official release in 2002, you can download and proof now.

28 for September
17 for October
24 for November
12 for December
---------------
81 New Etexts in the last month.

We need to average about 83 per month to do 1,000 per year.

We just barely made it to 81, as we posted all the Human Genome work
in the last 24 hours. . .so it's going to be much closer than anyone
thinks. . . .

And here are the listings for the this month's new Etexts:

With this Etext we have now completed September, 2002, except for the
remaining volumes of The Arabian Nights and #3431 whis is *reserved*.
Last month we had listed 8 for September, this month there are 35 for
a monthly increase of 28 for September, 2002.

My apologies for the odd presentation. . .I am still working on these
new formats required for the weekly Newsletters, which, of course, do
present 5 times the opportunity to make mistakes. . .hopefully I will
have this under control by July 4th, as promised. . . .


Here are the 50 Project Gutenberg Etexts for September, 2002
Some of these are still *reserved*. . .as indicated by an  *
