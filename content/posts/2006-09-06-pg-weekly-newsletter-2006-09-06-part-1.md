Some Suggestions We Received For The Newsletters


0.
Several people have merely suggested to other readers
that they start from both ends and read to the middle
and thus they will get the highlights first, and then
the regular features, requests, etc. that stay pretty
much the same from issue to issue.

I would agree with this suggestion, and would simply,
for my own edification, also read the "Flashback," as
I find it interesting to see Project Gutenberg eBooks
as they appeared in our catalog x years ago.


1.
Divide the Newsletter in Web page URLs so the readers
could just jump to whatever portions they wanted.
[This would take some additional labor by someone who
was more familiar with writing web pages than I.]

You should already be able to jump to whichever parts
you want to read. . .simply use your search commands,
search for "*" plus the section header as outlined in
The Table of Contents.


2.
Redivide PT1 of the Weekly Newsletter into two parts.

[This would create a lot more work for whomever edits
the Newsletters, which probably wouldn't be so bad if
that were their only responsibility.  I work to point
of exhaustion nearly every single day, and I need for
things to become easier rather than harder.  Hence my
requests for anyone who would like to be editor:  the
format of the Newsletter would be their choice and we
could either turn over the statistics to them, or our
stats people could simply send in that portion, ahead
of the deadline by an hour or two.  We would continue
to encourage our readers to send in news items not in
the main regular media coverage.]


*

We are interested in increasing the "SF" available at Project Gutenberg of
Australia. To this end we are happy to receive donations of ebooks to add
to our collection.

SF, in this context can mean: Science, Speculative, Superhero, Swords,
Sorcery, Spies, Supernatural and Scary Fiction.

Of course, we are only able to accept works that are public domain in
Australia.

Generally speaking, this means that the author died in 1954 or earlier.

Please see our WANTED list at http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html for
authors and works of interest. If you have suggestions for authors or
works to add to the list, please let us know.  Do check first that
they are not already available at Project Gutenberg Australia or
Project Gutenberg, please.  Contact details are provided on the WANTED page.

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

As always, ebooks by Australian authors and of general Australian interest
are always greatly appreciated.


Editor's comments appear in [brackets].

               have to hunt down by hand to reconcile.]
               [Pleast note there is some duplication between
               these various collections.  Volunteers needed
               to take these duplications into account.]

                ~11% of the way from 20,000 to 30,000

[Please note that the four collections totals are eBooks that originated
as created, edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and
its 50,000 volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with
75,000+ eBooks contains entire eBook collections from other sources, all
the production statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created
by the various teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share
the responsibility of maintaining.  The Consortia Center eBooks were and
are the responsibility of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy
to forward any suggestions for correction to those eLibraries, but those
eBooks must be edited by the donating parties, as per their requests.]

             18,022 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~265 eBooks per Month for ~68.00 Months

            2,942 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

            29 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
             9,001 totAl from Distributed Proofreaders

              [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]
            [Note, PGDP mostly included in US eBooks]
         [Note, PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders
          whose total closely matches their grand total]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]

        We Are Averaging ~366 eBooks Per Month This Year!!!
                [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 84 eBooks Per Week In 2006
                        85 This Week
                       115 Last Week
                       471 This Month [Aug]

[This was one of those months with 5 Wednesdays, our work week
runs from about noon Wednesday, Eastern Time Zone, for 7 days]


It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our 1st 10,000 eBooks

It took ~12.5 years from Jan. 1994 to Jun. 2006 to go from 100 to 20,100

It took ~32 months, from 2003 to 2006 for our last 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to 20,000

It took ~2.3 years from Jan. 2004 to Aug. 2006 from 11,000 to 21,000

Not counting the addition of The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center

*

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

General Catalog of Old Books and Authors

http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm

which now indexes 24,000 books available free online, including all
PG(US) & PG(Aus)'s books, along with some basic date information
about them and their authors where you can find more.

Plus many books not available on line, a good place to search
for books by specific authors who you are interested in.

For information please contact Philip Harper
&lt;webmaster AT kingkong.demon.co.uk&gt;

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is an experimental online reader available.
Start from any bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject

and

The PG bittorrent tracker is up and running.
Aaron Cannon has placed the CD and DVD there if anyone wants to test.
You can access it by visiting

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

*Project Gutenberg Consortia Center Report

The PGCC collection at http://www.gutenberg.cc has doubled
in size from the listings below, but we don't have exactly
matching collection sizes yet for a new breakdown.

There are ~160,000 separate downloadable files,
and presuming 50% are reduntant or are required
at the level of more than one file per book:

The number of individual eBooks now is about 80,000.

Thus the grand total of eBooks at Project Gutenberg
is 21,000+ created by Project Gutenberg volunteers,
plus 80,000 donated from over 100 other eLibraries,
to create a downloadble library of 100,000+ eBooks
!

of 18 collections. . .with this week's listing as:

CIA's Electronic Reading Room,      2,019 Reference Files
=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~34,286 Unique eBooks

*

The new overall collection size, which has reduced the
need to account for duplications and eBooks with files
for each chapter, etc.
                                  75,000+ Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 25,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 6,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet?

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,542,336,642 that would be 21,090 x 65,423,366 = ~1.38 Trillion !!!

With 21,090 eBooks online as of September 06, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.72 from each book.
[1% world population x #eBooks] 65,423,366 x 21,090 x $.73 = ~$1 Trillion
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]
[By the way, the US "popclock" is about to turn to 300 million people.]
[Just turning 299.7 million this week!]


A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.47 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 21,090 eBooks online as of September 06, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.47 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.59 when we had 17,106 eBooks a year ago.

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100,000,000 people.

Next Decade's Target:  15% Of The world Population = 1,000,000,000 people.


At 21,090 eBooks in 35 Years and 02.00 Months We Averaged
       600 Per Year
        50 Per Month
         1.64 Per Day

At 2942 eBooks Done In The 245 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
    12.0 Per Day
      84 per Week
     368 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 298M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 1/6 the way to 299M, so
it will probably be 10 more weeks to 299M and 22 more to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

*

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]



NORWICH LAUNCHES FREE WI-FI
The city of Norwich, in the United Kingdom, has launched an 18-month
pilot test of a free wireless network covering several areas of the
city. Kurt Frary, manager of the project, said that the implementation,
which includes more than 200 antennae, has been trouble-free so far. In
an effort not to compete with commercial services, the network offers
speeds of 256 Kbps for the public. Users must also log in again every
60 minutes if they want to use the network longer than an hour. Because
the network is open, Frary advised using firewalls, antivirus
protection, and, for business users, VPNs for individuals who connect
to the network. Paul Adams, a member of the city council, said the
pilot is intended to gauge the benefits of free Wi-Fi for both the
public and municipal employees. During the first three weeks of the
test, a significant portion of the usage was centered around
universities and libraries in the city, according to Adams, who
predicted that "Educational use, student use, and the virtual learning
environment is going to be a big use."

MOON GAME USES REAL DATA
A new computer game developed by California-based Virtue Arts uses real
data about the moon, prompting NASA to say it will use the software to
develop space vehicles and train astronauts. Using public data
collected by NASA and international space organizations, the developers
of Lunar Racing Championship created an environment that accurately
portrays the topography and environmental conditions of the moon in a
car-racing game. Because the moon's gravity is so much less than the
Earth's, for example, cars in the game rely not on aerodynamics but on
small rocket boosters for control. The fine dust on the moon's surface
combined with the low gravity can result in dust clouds if a vehicle
travels at more than 8 m.p.h., a concern both for players of the game
and for NASA scientists designing vehicles for the moon. Virtue Arts
developed technology that allows a PC to process the vast amount of
data necessary to create a realistic environment. The company is
expected to begin selling the lunar exploration software this fall.

JUDGE IN BRAZIL ORDERS GOOGLE TO TURN OVER DATA
A judge in Brazil has ordered Google to release user information
relating to an investigation of child pornography and hate speech.
Prosecutors in the country allege that users of Orkut, a networking
site operated by Google, use the site to exchange illegal photographs
and to post hate speech targeting blacks, Jews, and homosexuals.
Officials from Google said that although the company has been
cooperating with investigative requests from Brazilian authorities,
Google does not maintain information on users of Orkut. The judge in
the case rejected that argument and ordered Google to turn over
requested information or face fines of $23 million per day. "It is not
relevant that the data are stored in the United States," said Judge
Jose Marcos Lunardelli, "since all the photographs and messages being
investigated were published by Brazilians, through Internet connection
in national territory."

HARVARD OFFERS VIRTUAL CLASS IN SECOND LIFE
This fall, Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson will coteach a
course on argument with his daughter, Harvard Extension School
instructor Rebecca Nesson, that will take place in the Second Life
virtual world. In Second Life, users create avatars that they control,
using them to move around the virtual environment and interact with
others and with the virtual physical space. A number of other colleges
and universities have used Second Life as a component of certain
courses. For this new course at Harvard, Nesson and Nesson will teach
students--entirely through the virtual environment--how to use blogs,
wikis, podcasts, and other electronic tools to make effective
arguments. The class, which is open to the public through Harvard's
extension school, will take place in an online replica of the
university's Ames Courtroom. Rebecca Nesson will hold office hours in
Second Life; Charles Nesson's office hours will be in his actual office.

ONLINE COURSES DRAW GROWING NUMBERS OF STUDENTS
According to new research conducted by Eduventures, online education
has come to represent a considerable portion of continuing and
professional education students at nonprofit institutions. For-profit
institutions are typically considered the leaders in online
enrollments, but nonprofits now have about 20 percent of their
continuing and professional students in such programs. The study, which
covered 43 institutions, also found that online courses take more time
and money to develop than in-class courses and that half of the
institutions that offer online programs have outsourced at least some
of the components. Eduventures also predicted that enrollments in
online continuing education programs will grow by about 20 percent
annually for the next several years.

DOWNLOADING STARTS AT GOOGLE BOOK SEARCH
Google's controversial Book Search program is set to begin offering
downloads of entire out-of-copyright texts. Until now, books in the
program were available online only. With the option to download texts,
users can now easily search those texts, print copies of them, or keep
local copies on their computers to read offline. Books still under
copyright protection are not available for download. Instead, small
sections of text are online for users to view, unless the copyright
owner grants Google permission to show more text. Many publishers and
others have objected to Google's model, saying that even scanning
copyrighted books and displaying snippets of them violates their
copyright. Sidney Verba, director of the Harvard University Library,
one of the libraries participating in the program, said that the
ability to search texts allows users to "find previously buried
information about historical events or people, places of interest, and
matters cultural or scientific."

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


*QUOTATION OF THE WEEK

"Dwarf Planet" new designation for Pluto.

After years of scientific and/or political wrangling,
The Solar System is back to where it was 76 years ago
when there were only 8 planets. . .Pluto in Doghouse,
is what the headlines could have read.

Of course, this leaves the door wide open for all the
"interested parties" to now strip Mars of one moon or
perhaps both, as it it widely presume that Phobos was
and asteroid that simply was in the wrong place at an
inconvenient time and was scooped up by Mars, perhaps
the same was true of Diemos as well.  Phobos is quite
small, perhaps only 10 km the longest way.

Some discussion remains about what to do with Pluto's
moon, Charon, which originally made Pluto look larger
than it was to primitive telescopes of the 1900s, and
undoubtedly other local solar objects are in danger.

Multiple sources


*STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Only 2 million of 32 million copyrighted books are in print.

Thus, even if Borders and Barnes & Noble had every one in print
15 books out of 16 under copyright would'nt be on their shelves.

&gt;From BBC News Online

Eight times humans came to try to live in Britain and on at least seven
occasions they failed - beaten back by freezing conditions. Scientists
think they can now write a reasonably comprehensive history of the
occupation of these isles.

[Yes, there HAVE been several Ice Ages in the past 700,000 years,
so not terribly surprising. . .will they survive the next one?]

It stretches from 700,000 years ago and the first known settlers at
Pakefield in Suffolk, through to the most recent incomers just 12,000 years
or so ago. The evidence comes from the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain
Project.

This five-year undertaking by some of the UK's leading palaeo-experts has
reassessed a mass of scientific data and filled in big knowledge gaps with
new discoveries.

*DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

Economic statistics for the 1st quarter were revised last week,
upward to 2.9% growth, but the rate of inflation was still not
included in the reports, though, in an interesting change from
their usual practice of leaving them out altogether, reporters
did mention that inflations was "very much higher" than growth.

Several sources.


MORE DOUBLESPEAK

Given that this is the "official" launch of the US election,
there was plenty to go around, but nothing very impressive.


*POLITICAL QUOTES OF THE WEEK

Given that this is the "official" launch of the US election,
there was plenty to go around, but nothing very impressive.


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Given the election rhetoric, we'll hear more and more,
but it will be about less and less, until the gloves
come off at the very end.

*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

[I think the inflation/growth statistics in the news
were plenty odd enough.  However, I should add that
manufacturing costs rose sharply around the world,
up 1.1% in the UK in July alone, though those have
not yet reached the consumer markets.]

*

By the way, for those interested, the official U.S. population
estimates just passed 298 million, though many say estimations
of this nature leave out as much as 5% of the population, with
the obvious exclusion of the 11-12 million immigrant workers
now being mentioned so much in the news.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
is obviously no longer 6% of the world.  In fact, rounding to the
nearest percent, the US will soon fall from 5% to 4%.]

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
