* Help sought for Storybud

I am a visually impaired student and father of 2 young children.As
part of my studies at college here in Mayo, Ireland, I have designed a
story website, www.storybud.org

Initially the site was created for parents in a similar visually
impaired situation to myself, i.e. we cannot 'read' stories to our
children in the traditional book sense.  The site works with speech
software used by blind and visually impaired computer users,
allowing them the same enjoyment of story telling.  However since its
inception December 2011 the site has been expanded to allow many
different users to access the site, and of course the site can also be
used and enjoyed by sighted users as well.

Storybud has further developed and now has 3 different formats: text,
audio combined text, and audio.  Stories are 'blocked' into short text
blocks to assist beginner readers.  Project Gutenberg readers might be
interested in this as a learning or leisure resource.  Please note
storybud is a community oriented project and I have no interest in
commercialising it.  It is purely to share the joy of stories from
around the world in an inclusive manner.

Most of the material is from Project Gutenberg and Librivox, who have
allowed us to use same.  If you have any questions, comments, feedback
etc you can contact me at: Paul Halligan &lt;tigerone at eircom.net>

Also if you know of any other organizations/bodies who may be
interested in the project please pass on the site url:  www.storybud.org
