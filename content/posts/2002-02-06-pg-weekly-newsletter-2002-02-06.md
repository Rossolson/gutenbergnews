Requests For Assistance

I need an email address for Kenna Therrien, for copyright.

Did anyone back up the Naked Word site before it died. . . ?
We would like to do the copyright research to bring back as
much of it as possible.

PROOFERS NEEDED:  As many proofers as possible are needed to
proof files containing checkmate positions in FEN notation.
The proofers need to identify board positions which are not
checkmates!  Reply to Brett Fishburne &lt;vze22fdi@verizon.net&gt;

If you find an e-text on the web and need to find a matching pre-1923 edition
to correct it and get copyright approval. . .or if you live near a library
with at a million books and are willing help people find matching editions?
Please email contact Charles Aldarondo (Aldarondo@yahoo.com) and he will try
to connect people lacking a large local collection with whose who have the
means to help from their local collections, and he will explaining the process
of finding/comparing/correcting/submitting such eBooks to Project Gutenberg.

If anyone has the time and inclination to do so, Faust(Part 1)
by Goethe (etext02/faust10.*) could use a good proofreading.

Anyone with a music background who might be interested
in helping out with the Gutenberg Classical Music Project
please contact:  Geof Pawlicki &lt;gpawlicki@earthlink.net&gt;

Some of our Production Coordinators who do nearly an eBook per day
could use a little help now and then, as we are on the verge of our
first 200 eBook month, and thus they have been somewhat overworked.
If you can help with just one eBook per week or per month, email:
Brett Fishburne &lt;william.fishburne@verizon.net&gt;
[He could also use some C++ and UNIX programming help]

We need some volunteers who can do the most basic copyright research,
basically just looking to see if either the publication date or the
copyright date is before 1923.  For legal purposes we should probably
ask for librarians or other professionals for this.

If you need to follow-up on materials sent in for copyright research,
contact Michael Hart at hart@pobox.com.  Also send him a message if
you recently sent in an etext to be posted, and haven't seen it yet.
You can send a copyright scan to Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;
or as a .jpg only to Dianne Bean &lt;pg_research@yahoo.com&gt;.

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
of North America.  For information about how to set one
up, contact Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;

***

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Choose a mirror of the Project
Gutenberg collection near you.

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

&lt;http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;
or
&lt;ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.
Note that updated etexts usually go in their original
directory (e.g., etext01, etext02, etc.).

***

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 02/06/02**:  4492
(This number includes the 40 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

In the first five weeks of the new year, we have produced 200 new etexts!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,492 eTexts online as of February 06, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.23 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.15 when we had 3170 Etexts A Year Ago

THE INCREASE IN CHIP SPEED IS ACCELERATING, NOW SLOWING
from The New York Times

SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 3 - In the world of computer chips, Moore's Law is
becoming less of an axiom and more of a drag race.

At the world's premier chip design conference, which begins here today, the
spotlight will be on blinding computer speed. That emphasis suggests that
the trajectory of desktop PC performance increases of the last two years
will not slow in the near future, but actually accelerate.

Intel, the world's dominant manufacturer of microprocessors, will present a
paper detailing a portion of a microprocessor chip that has performed at up
to 10 gigahertz at room temperature - the fastest calculating speed yet
reported for a microprocessor, the chip that controls the math, logic and
data-transfer functions of a computer.
&lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/technology/04CHIP.html&gt;

The preceding science story appeared in the general media and was compiled
by the Media Resource Service, Sigma Xi's referral service for journalists
in need of sources of scientific expertise.

PALM PLANS TO FAST-TRACK ITS NEW OPERATING SYSTEM
Palm, responding to criticism over a lack of innovation, has decided to
move ahead of schedule with a significant upgrade of its operating system.
Palm OS 5, which will be previewed at the kickoff of Palm's annual
developer conference in San Jose next week, will be commercially available
by mid-year. The new software release marks the formal debut of PalmSource,
Palm's software subsidiary. Palm OS 5 is geared toward the faster ARM
microprocessor line and features expanded encryption capability for
enhanced security. It also incorporates support for Wi-Fi networking and
for playing and recording audio. (Wall Street Journal 5 Feb 2002)

IBM PULLS THE PLUG ON PEN-BASED NOTEBOOK
IBM is discontinuing its ThinkPad TransNote, a portable PC that also
captured notes jotted on paper. The company had introduced TransNote last
year amid great fanfare, but analysts say its high price and limited
usability hampered marketing efforts. The notebook was priced at around
$3,000 and did not provide true handwriting recognition. Instead, it used a
special pad that incorporated transceivers to track a pen's movement while
the user was taking notes and then transmitted that information to a text
file. The demise of the TransNote comes on the heels of Sony's announcement
last month that it would quickly phase out its Vaio Simtop Pen Tablet and
foretells a less-than-enthusiastic market response to the upcoming debut of
Microsoft's Tablet PC. (ZDNet 4 Feb 2002)

[They say TV commercials are the great art form of our time. . . .]
TIVO: DESPERATELY REPEATING BRITNEY SPEARS
An analysis of Super Bowl-watching subscribers to TiVo, the digital video
recorder that allows viewers to pause and rewind live TV, found that
subscribers weren't taking second looks at touchdowns or referee calls,
they were taking second looks at commercials, such as one for Pepsi by
singing and dancing pop star Britney Spears. The implication is that
advertisers will have to spend even more money on commercials than they
already do, in order to make them compelling enough to watch over and over
again. Santa Clara University marketing professor Shelby McIntyre says: "
There's been a longstanding argument of whether you have to like a
commercial for it to be effective. In the old days when people had to sit
there in front of the TV and accept the ad, you could have massive
repetitions. But now people are not going to be forced to sit through these
kinds of things.'' Forrester Research, a market research firm, predicts
that the number of U.S. households with TiVo or some other digital video
recorder will grow from the current level of 800,000 to about 42 million by
2006. (San Jose Mercury News 5 Feb 2002)

PRICE OF BROADBAND DAMPENS DEMAND IN EUROPE
Consumers in Europe's three main Internet target countries -- the UK,
France and Germany -- are not ready to pay broadband connection charges
that are double what they're paying now for narrowband Internet access,
according to a new study by GartnerG2. Fewer than 10% of wired households
say broadband represents good value, and few plan to upgrade their
connections in the next three years. A big part of the problem is that so
far, there has been little investment in developing content for broadband
services, says GartnerG2 -- a situation that is likely to continue until
there is a critical mass of broadband subscribers. GartnerG2 says prices
must come down sharply to raise the proportion of households with broadband
access above the 10% by 2005. Currently, less than 2% of households in the
UK, France and Germany have broadband connections, with monthly charges
averaging between $39 and $52. (BBC News 4 Feb 2002)

MAJORITY OF U.S. POPULATION NOW ON THE WEB
New numbers from the U.S. Commerce Department indicate that in 2001, the
number of Americans who use the Web passed the 50% mark for the first time.
The report found that 143 million Americans, or 54% of the population, were
using the Internet as of September, up from 26% a year earlier. E-mail
continues to be the favorite activity, regularly used by 45% of the
population (up from 35% in 2000). The figures for young people aged 5-17
are especially noteworthy, with 90% now using computers. The study also
indicated that the so-called "digital divide" is narrowing, with Internet
use among the poorest citizens -- those earning less than $15,000 per
household -- up 25%, while growth among the richest households is up only
11%. [How can it go up? It's saturated.] (Wall Street Journal 4 Feb 2002)

[More on Moore]
FASTER, FASTER: NO SLOWDOWN IN MOORE'S LAW
"Moore's Law" -- the remarkably accurate 1965 prediction by Intel
co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors on a chip would
double about every 18 months (thereby also roughly doubling the chip's
computing speed) -- is truer than ever, with new evidence suggesting that
the computer industry will be able to further shrink one dimension of
modern processors (the "physical gate length," or the space between two key
components in a solid-state transistor). The result will be even-faster
chips a few years from now, and one example of the new chipmaking
environment is Intel's announcement of a chip that has performed at up to
10 gigahertz speeds at room temperature, the fastest performance yet for
any microprocessor. (New York Times 4 Feb 2002)

HANDHELD SALES UP 25% IN 2001
Sales of handheld devices in the U.S. rose 25% in 2001, but the growth rate
has slowed considerably from previous years, according to a study by NPD
Techworld. In 2000, U.S. sales of handheld computers doubled from a year
earlier, and unit growth almost tripled in the same period. Still, the gains
in 2001 pose a bright spot for the industry following the price-cutting war
between Palm and Handspring mid-year. "Sales were slow in the middle of the
year, but as handheld computing grows into a more mainstream consumer
category, it needs a range of products, including lower-priced products,"
says NPD Techworld research director Steve Baker. The average price of a
handheld computer dropped to $259 by the end of 2001, down from $293 at the
beginning of the year. The top five handheld manufacturers in 2001 are: Palm,
Handspring, Compaq, Sony and Hewlett-Packard.(Wall Street Journal 31 Jan 2002)

UNITED STATES SAYS WEB USE HAS RISEN TO 54 PERCENT
The U.S. Commerce Department will release a report concluding
that 54 percent of the national population--143 million--were
using the Web as of September, a 26 percent gain over the year
before. Separate studies from the private sector arrived at
slightly lower estimates: Nielsen//NetRatings, for example,
pegged the increase at 15 percent, or 115.2 million, in October.
About 2 million new users came aboard every month in 2001,
according to the government report. E-mail, the most popular
online activity, was regularly used by 45 percent of the
population, a 10 percent increase over 2000. The government
report also indicates that the digital divide between America's
well-to-do and its poor has started to shrink. Internet usage by
America's most impoverished citizens increased at an annual rate
of 25 percent between December 1998 and September 2001, compared
to 11 percent among the wealthiest citizens. Among minorities,
33 percent more African Americans were using the Web each year
between August 2000 and September 2001, while usage among
Hispanics increased at a rate of 30 percent.
