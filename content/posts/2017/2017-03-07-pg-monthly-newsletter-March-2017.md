## Michael Hart's 70th Birthday

Michael Stern Hart was born in Tacoma, Washington on March 8, 1947. He died on September 6, 2011 in his home in Urbana, Illinois, at the age of 64.  March 8, 2017 would have been his 70th birthday.

The creation of free eBooks, digitized for unlimited distribution, began on July 4, 1971.  On that day, Michael typed the U.S. Declaration of Independence on a mainframe computer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and shared it with other users on the network.  He devoted his great energy, deep intellect, and passion for learning to building the Project Gutenberg library.

A lifetime intellectual, Hart was inspired by his parents, both professors at the University of Illinois, to seek truth and to question authority. One of his favorite quotes, credited to George Bernard Shaw, is characteristic of his approach to life:

>   "Reasonable people adapt themselves to the world. Unreasonable people attempt to adapt the world to themselves. All progress, therefore, depends on unreasonable people."

Project Gutenberg is grateful to Michael for his caring, leadership, and unreasonableness.  We miss him dearly.
