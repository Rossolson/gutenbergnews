## Give eBooks!

This is the time of year when people from many cultures, across the world, are looking for ideas about gifts for their friends, colleagues and loved ones.

Project Gutenberg encourages giving eBooks.  The entire collection athttps://www.gutenberg.org is free for everyone, with almost no restrictions.  Some gift-giving ideas:

  - Give a link.  Choose an eBook of interest, and provide a link to that eBook's landing page athttps://www.gutenberg.org/ .  Recipients will be able to choose from HTML, epub, kindle, and other formats.  Having trouble selecting an eBook?  Maybe the Top 100 list will give you some ideas:https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top

  - Give a collection.  Send a group of links, or download a group of eBooks.  You can copy Project Gutenberg eBooks to CD/DVD discs, to USB flash drives, to cloud storage, or even send them by email.  When you download an eBook in HTML format ("Read this book online"), make sure you "save as / complete" or similar so that all the images are included in the download.

  - Give some guidance.  Do you know someone who loves to read, and needs some help to use Project Gutenberg?  Offer some help to get started reading eBooks.  Some of the eBook reader devices can be tricky, so you might consult this How-To:https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:MobileReader_Devices_How-To (updates and suggestions are always welcome!).

  - Donate as a tribute.  A donation to Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/donate) or Distributed Proofreaders (http://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DPFoundation:Information_for_Donors) will help to keep the sites running, and will also help support digitization and distribution of more eBooks.


## News Entries Welcome

If you have an item of interest to Project Gutenberg newsletter readers, please send it (you can respond directly to this message).  There have not been news submissions in these past few months, which is why a newsletter hasn't been issued since July.


## Thanks!

We received the following note of appreciation, one of many recognizing the volunteers who have made Project Gutenberg vibrant and active for over 46 years:

   "Dear Dr. Gregory Newby I would like to give my regards concerning the books that are available to the general audience.

   Kudos to you and your fellow coworkers for this project."


## Danger: Net Neutrality is under Attack (again, still)

Project Gutenberg Supports Net Neutrality

The Federal Communications Commission in the US is considering abandoning major components of network neutrality. This would legitimize "slow lanes" for network traffic that does not come from commercial partners of network providers.

This could include sites where content is free, and generates no revenue - such as Project Gutenberg.  Much of the Internet content you enjoy would be at risk for downgraded speeds, access fees imposed by your network provider, or ads embedded by your network provider.

Comments are solicited by the FCC atwww.fcc.gov. Project Gutenberg encourages you to send messages to the FCC and your lawmakers, to express your views on this important issue.
