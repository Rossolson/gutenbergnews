## Project Gutenberg turns 46!
  
July 4, 2017 was the 46th birthday of Project Gutenberg.  On July 4, 1971, founder Michael S. Hart typed the U.S. Declaration of Independence (now available at <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1>).  Michael worked tirelessly to make the world's great literature freely available in electronic form.  Today, eBooks are a mainstay of the human experience with literature and content of all types.


## Danger: Net Neutrality is under Attack (again)

July 12 is a day of action.  See <https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#join> to learn about renewed interest by the FCC in removing "net neutrality." This could make your Project Gutenberg downloads, and other Internet activities, much slower - at the whims of Internet providers.


## NAFTA may seek Copyright Term Extensions in Canada

It now appears that the US copyright lobby will attempt to use NAFTA to force Life+70 on the people of Canada and descendants. Additional changes could change the balance against fair use. For more information, see:
> <http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2017/06/naftacopyrightcomments/>

The Canadian government is currently inviting public comment, with an end date of July 18th:
> <http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/consultations/nafta-alena/info.aspx>

It would be helpful to have as many Canadians as possible submit comments opposing copyright extensions, or indeed any inclusion of Canada's copyright laws in the NAFTA talks.  Comments may be submitted via online form, by postal mail, or at in-person consultations (although none are currently scheduled).


## New Creative Commons eBook

This new eBook may be of interest to people seeking to understand the benefits of the public domain:

> <https://creativecommons.org/made-with-cc/>

From the forward:

> "Today, copyright is like a lottery ticket– everyone has one, and almost nobody wins. What they don’t tell you is that if you choose to share your work, the returns can be significant and long-lasting. This book is filled with stories of those who take much greater risks than the two dollars we pay for a lottery ticket, and instead reap the rewards that come from pursuing their passions and living their values."
