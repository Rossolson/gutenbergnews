## The TPP

The Trans-Pacific Partnership appears to have fallen apart in recent months.  As mentioned in prior newsletters, the TPP was going to be bad news for the public domain, in several of the potential signatory countries.  It is Project Gutenberg's desire that the public domain will continue to be robust, broad, and accessible across the world.


## Public Domain Growth in 2019

The Public Domain will grow again in 2019!  In the US, annual copyright term expiry is set to begin again in 2019, after a 20-year hiatus due to the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998. On January 1, 2019, items published in 1923 will enter the public domain in the US. In the early days of Project Gutenberg, growth of the public domain on January 1 was an annual event. See Duke Law's "Public Domain Day" for a listing of many items that were scheduled to enter the public domain, but have yet to do so because of the 1998 extension:

> <https://law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/>

It is possible that a new copyright term extension law will be introduced and passed, while attention is elsewhere. The 1998 extension, which was the last of 14 copyright term extensions in the 20th century, occurred at the same time as the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Distraction was a benefit to that law's passage, and it is conceivable that history could repeat itself. Project Gutenberg is in favor of renewed growth of the public domain due to limited-term copyright.

Some notable items scheduled to enter the public domain in 2019 include Felix Salten's "Bambi" and Kahlil Gibran's "The Prophet."
