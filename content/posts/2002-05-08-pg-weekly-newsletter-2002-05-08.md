Project Gutenberg needs help getting its news releases
to the right people.  We'd like to use BusinessWire
(http://www.businesswire.com) but it's very expensive.
Does your organization use BusinessWire?  Might they pay
to distribute Project Gutenberg news releases?  If you have
connections or ideas to help get the word out to national
and international media organizations, please email me.

We are still in need of more media email addresses!!!

     Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 05/08/02**:  5,152
(This number includes the 71 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)

In the first 17 weeks of the new year, we have produced 851 new eBooks.
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1997 to produce our *FIRST* 851 eBooks!!!

Mar 1997 Democracy and Education, by John Dewey [JDewey #1][dmeduxxx.xxx] 852
Mar 1997 Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson [crmmrxxx.xxx] 851

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year for 2001, so the 9th was the end of the first production week.

With 5,179 eTexts online as of May 8, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.93 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.89 when we had 3441 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.96 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

Headlines From Newsscan

AOL TIME WARNER: TO BE OR NOT TO BE, THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION
With AOL's performance dragging on the company formed by the merger
of  "new media" company AOL and "old media" company Time Warner, some
business strategists are suggesting that the two parts of the company
should split up again, but incoming chief executive Richard D. Parsons has
a poor opinion of that suggestion, and says: "We're the No. 1 movie
company, the No. 1 online company, the No. 1 premium cable network company,
the No. 1 cable network company, No. 2 cable company, No. 2 music company.
What am I missing? All of these businesses are roaring, with one exception
[AOL], no question. What we've got to do is answer some serious questions
around AOL. What is the future of narrowband? Is this a medium that has a
long-term advertising future and if so, at what rate can we expect growth
and how will it migrate to broadband? Those are legitimate questions which
we're focusing on now in the company. There was, is and will be an
execution issue that we have to deal with. The execution issue that remains
is: 'How do you get the parts to work in such a way that the whole is
greater than the sum of the parts?'" (New York Times 6 May 2002)
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/technology/07AOL.html

LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, BUT TEACH HIM HOW TO SURF
A National Research Council study called "Youth, Pornography and the
Internet" rejects the idea that new laws or new technology will provide any
real answer to the problem of protecting children from being exposed to
pornography on the Internet. The answer, it suggests, is to teach children
to become mature, and protect themselves. "Swimming pools can be dangerous
for children. To protect them, one can install locks, put up fences and
deploy alarms. All of these measures are helpful, but by far the most
important thing that one can do for one's children is to teach them how to
swim." (New York Times 3 May 2002)

NOTEBOOKS ON THE RISE AS PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL PC SALES
The percentage of notebook computers versus desktop PCs shipped worldwide
climbed from 21.8% in 4Q 2001 to 23.8% in the first quarter of 2002,
according to IDC, which predicts notebook sales will break the 25% barrier
in 2005, rising to as much as 30% in 2006. Those numbers reflect an
increase in the mobility among computer users, as well as the return of
more corporate buyers to the market. Computer makers that sell both laptops
and desktop machines typically reap higher profits on each notebook because
they can charge a premium for the lightweight, mobile machines. At the same
time, prices on notebooks have been dropping, with some available for
prices as low as $999. Looking forward, IDC predicts that sales of
notebooks will surge when corporations begin upgrading their computers next
year, with many choosing mid-range notebooks this time around instead of
desktop PCs. (CNet News.com 3 May 2002)

SWEDISH CELL PHONE USERS CAN PINPOINT FRIENDS' LOCATIONS
Customers of Sweden's Telia Mobile have a new way to find out where their
friends are -- by using their cell phone. The service, called
friendPosition, uses graphic and text messages to reveal the locations of
other users. Both people -- the seeker and the sought -- must be using
specially enabled cell phones equipped with wireless location services. The
friendPosition service could prove a boon to Telia, which, like other
wireless carriers, is looking for ways to boost average revenues per user.
The $2 a month charge may not seem like much, but could be critical in an
industry with very slim profit margins. Meanwhile, similar services could
be heading this way, says one analyst: "Commercial location services will
be available here by the end of the year," predicts Al Fross, a principal
at Pelorus Group. He estimates that global revenue from wireless location
services could reach $3.2 billion by 2006. (Investor's Business Daily 2 May
2002)  [Of course, we have to wonder who else knows where you are. . . .]

Headlines From Edupage

COURT SAYS ISP CAN DROP SPAMMERS
A New York State appeals court has ruled that PaeTec Communications is
allowed to disconnect MonsterHut from its service. MonsterHut is a bulk
e-mailer and, according to PaeTec, an egregious spammer. After PaeTec
notified MonsterHut that their service with the ISP would be
discontinued for violations of PaeTec's policies, MonsterHut filed a
lawsuit to stay in operation. Despite an earlier injunction from a
state supreme court judge preventing the ending of service, the appeals
court on Friday upheld PaeTec's complaint. The brief ruling agreed
that MonsterHut had violated their agreement with PaeTec, saying that
PaeTec did not need to prove that two percent of all recipients of
MonsterHut's e-mail had complained.  Newsbytes, 6 May 2002

GRADUATE STUDENT RAISES IRE OF FONT COMPANIES
A graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University has been receiving
complaints from several font-creating companies, who argue that an
application he wrote violates the DMCA. The student, Tom Murphy, wrote
the application, called Embed, so that fonts he created could be used
by anyone, whenever they wanted. Embed modifies "a few ones and zeroes"
in the font file, allowing the font to be used without restrictions.
Applying Embed to a copyrighted font, however, may be illegal because
it would circumvent the copyright protections included in fonts. Murphy
said he did not create the program to use copyrighted fonts illegally
and has refused to stop posting Embed on his Web site.

CONGRESSMEN INTRODUCE BILL REQUIRING BIOMETRIC MARKERS
Congressmen Jim Moran (D-Va.) and Tom Davis (R-Va.) have proposed a
$315 million program mandating biometric markers on all driver's
licenses within five years. The representatives want licenses to carry
the driver's retinal scan, fingerprint, or some other kind of
biometric marker in an encrypted chip. The legislation would also
require states to use tougher criteria in verifying identity when
people apply for a driver's license, as well as strengthen federal
identity theft laws by making it a federal crime to alter a license.
Moran spokesman Dan Drummond said the card would help protect privacy
by reducing the use of Social Security numbers for identification. The
card would not be linked to a federal database, said Drummond, although
the states would share data under the proposal. ComputerWorld, 2 May 2002
http://www.idg.net/ic_855521_1794_9-10000.html

NOTEBOOK SALES CONTINUE TO GROW
Market research from IDC indicates that, for the third year running,
notebook PCs increased their share of the PC market compared to desktop
systems. In the first quarter of 2002 notebooks were 23.8 percent of
worldwide PC shipments, up from 21.8 percent in the fourth quarter of
2001 and 22.3 percent in the first quarter of 2001. Companies that sell
both notebooks and desktops typically profit more from notebooks
because they can charge a premium for portability, according to IDC.
Still, it will take time for notebooks to reach 50 percent of all PC
shipments. IDC predicts that, with the return of corporate buyers to
the market, the percentage of notebooks sold will rise to about 25
percent by 2005 and as much as 30 percent by 2006.
CNET, 3 May 2002   http://news.com.com/2100-1040-898370.html



[For years I have stated publicly that sites go out of their way
to force you to their home page, rather than to let you go where
you want to go on their sites, just to get the extra advertizing
and other exposure, and to count more hits, which they translate
into "the currency of the Web". . .here's some more about this.]

DEEP-LINKING DISPUTES RESURFACE
Two years ago U.S. District Judge Harry Hupp declared that deep
linking, the practice of hyperlinking to a specific page within a Web
site rather than the site's home page, was not a violation of
copyright law. The dispute has come up again, however, in several
recent complaints by site operators. The Danish Newspaper Publishers'
Association has asked that the practice be disallowed, and Belo, the
owner of "The Dallas Morning News," this week sent a stern letter to
BarkingDogs.org demanding the end of deep links to the newspaper's Web
site. If deep links were ultimately declared illegal, this would have
significant implications for many sites, including search engines,
which consistently bypass home pages. A spokesman for Belo said they
feel they should have some control over the use of their content and
that deep links undermine the advertising model for Web sites.

SECURITY FIRM UPSET AT LACK OF RESPONSE FROM NETSCAPE
AOL Time Warner's Netscape offers a $1,000 reward for discovering
serious security flaws in its Web browser. But a group of Israeli
security experts at GreyMagic Secuirty said they don't expect to
receive the reward because Netscape had not responded to their report
of a security hole almost a week after they notified the company. The
bug, according to GreyMagic, is similar to one in Internet Explorer and
can be used to access files on victims' computers without their
permission or knowledge. After receiving no response from Netscape, the
company released information about the bug and said in the future they
will publicly announce security holes without notifying Netscape.

PROPOSED RULE COULD PREVENT COLLEGES FROM CALLING ALUMNI
In January the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proposed establishing a
national do-not-call list that would be off-limits for telemarketers.
Those guilty of calling someone on the list could be fined up to
$11,000 per call. Although colleges and universities that manage their
own phone drives are not affected by the rule, many institutions,
particularly smaller ones, rely on for-profit telemarketing firms for
such fund-raising efforts. In those cases, marketers would not be
allowed to call school alumni on the do-not-call list. Several
associations representing higher education have sent letters to the FTC
requesting an exception for cases like these. A letter from the Council
for Advancement and Support of Education said applying the rule to
outside vendors working for a college or university would be
"inconsitent and unnecessary."  Chronicle of Higher Education, 1 May 2002
http://chronicle.com/free/2002/05/2002050101t.htm

HEMINGWAY GOES ONLINE
Scribner, an imprint of Simon and Schuster, announced that it would
release 23 of Ernest Hemmingway's works as electronic books. Books to
be released include "For Whom the Bell Tolls," "Death in the
Afternoon," "A Farewell to Arms," and "The Old Man and the Sea." Each
title will cost $9.99 to download. Susan Moldow, executive vice
president at Scribner, said her company is pleased to offer these works
in "publishing's first truly global format." Industry analysts are
skeptical about whether the move will boost the market for electronic
books, which have yet to realize early predictions for replacing paper books.
