Contrary to the beliefs of many Darwin scholars, the great evolutionist did not delay publishing his theory for fear of professional ridicule or social shame. According to a new analysis of Charles Darwin's correspondence, the real reason was much more prosaic â€“ he was snowed under with work.

In his autobiography Darwin said "I gained much by my delay" in publishing his theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859 as opposed to when he originally conceived it in 1839. But John van Wyhe, at Cambridge University, argues that the common interpretation of "Darwin's delay" is not correct. Darwin did not hold back his work On the Origin of Species to avoid a hostile reaction among his peers or denunciation by the church. Instead, he was tied up with writing about his travels around the world on the Beagle and other projects.
