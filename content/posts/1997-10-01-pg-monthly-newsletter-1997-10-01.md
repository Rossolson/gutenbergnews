Subject: Project Gutenberg Newsletter, October 1, 1997 [to Etext #1057]
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
To: hart@archive.org
Date: Wed, 1 Oct 1997 10:10:04 -0500 (CDT)

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for October, 1997  [ To Etext #1057]


Well. . .we [I] survived the mad rush to get Etext #1,000 online on schedule,
though I must admit I am still at little behind in posting some updated files
and answering yesterday's email. . . .

You will be receiving a separate note detailing Project Gutenberg's goals for
1998, and beyond, which may have some surprises for you.  If you have had the
idea of starting a project in your own country, region, or language, this one
is a message you won't want to miss.

It will be titled:  "Project Gutenberg Needs Your Help!" and should be coming
to you next week.

***

As you will notice below, we are completing our collection of Oscar Wilde and
would like to hear from you if you have any Wilde materials we have not filed
for downloading yet.

In addition, you will notice that we have started releasing Shakespeare, as I
promised we would after Etext #1,000, as individual files rather than only as
the "The Complete Works."  We hope to do several editions, and are forming an
Etext Team specifically for Shakespeare.  Please let me know if interested.

We will also be forming Etext Teams for other specific authors and subjects--
just let me know which you would like.

***

Dianne Bean, our Director of Production, has just moved this week and will be
out of email touch for a while.  Stepping in to help is one of our volunteers
from England, David Price &lt;ccx074@ccj.coventry.ac.uk&gt;, from the University of
Coventry.  David and Dianne will combine to take my place in November while I
am off schmoozing and conferencing on the West Coast, and doing a feasibility
study on the possibilities of moving back home to Tacoma, Washington.  I will
be up and down the coast in November and would love to stop to see as many of
you as possible, just let me know.  I will be spending most of my time in the
Seattle-Tacoma area the first half of the month, and in Silicon Valley and SF
Bay Area starting mid-month.

My Apologies:
Please note:  Due to my somewhat exorbitant efforts to get Etext #1,000 out on
schedule, I accidentally posted 36 Etexts in July, and 40 in August.  This was
pointed out to me in time to fix the August listings, but I just noticed July,
and since it is now to late to fix this easily, I will just remedy this by the
posting of only 28 Etexts labelled as September, to get us on track.  Oops! mh
[PS. . .I may change the month labelling later, but not the Etext name/number.

There are supposed to be 32 Project Gutenberg Etexts released every month.  mh


ELECTRONIC MONOGRAPHS ARE "GREAT ADVERTISING"
As university publishers struggle to find the right business model for
offering scholarly documents online, some early innovators are finding that
making a monograph available electronically can boost sales of hard copies.
The National Academy Press has already put 1,700 of its books online, and is
finding that the electronic versions of some books have boosted sales of the
hard copy monographs -- often by two to three times the previous level.
It's "great advertising," says the Press's director.  The MIT Press is
experiencing similar results:  "For each of our electronic books, we've
approximately doubled our sales.  The plain fact is that no one is going to
sit there and read a whole book online.  And it costs money and time to
download it."  Meanwhile, the Association of American Publishers has set up
a Web site to showcase its new Digital Object Identifier System, which
identifies copyrighted material and links the user to the copyright owners.
http://www.doi.org/overview.html  (Chronicle of Higher Education 12 Sep 97)

[In addition I heard a news report that said books of all varieties have
an average of 28% increased sales, if they are posted on the Internet.]

There are many sites around the world containing Project Gutenberg Etexts,
only two of which we actually maintain directly:  prairienet.org and also
archive.org.  uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu mirrors prairienet at 3AM & 3PM, and
is a much faster site.  You may find that some of these sites are faster,
much faster, from you location, but you may also find that some sites are
easier for you to use, depending on how you like to search our collection
of electronic book.  Of course, you can always download GUTINDEX.* files,
and do you own searching with your own favorite program.  That's my way!!
But many people really like the indexing and added information available,
especially from promo.net and sailor, as below.


You can get the Project Gutenberg books via FTP and the Web:

[This site is in Urbana, Illinois, and is quite fast]
ftp uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu or ftp 128.174.5.14
login:  anonymous
password:  yourname@your.machine
cd pub
cd etext
cd gutenberg
[or just cd /pub/etext/gutenberg/etext97]
cd etext97  [96, 95,94, 93, 92, 91 or 90.  70's and 80's are in /etext90]
get filename  (be sure to set bin, if you get the .zip files)
get more files
quit
