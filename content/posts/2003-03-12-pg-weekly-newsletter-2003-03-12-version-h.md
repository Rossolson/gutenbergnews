Requests for Assistance:

Project Gutenberg has received a generous donation of over 20 Pentium
Pro 100 computers.  If you have a need for a computer to do Project
Gutenberg work or can make good use of computers (setting up a
"Project Gutenberg" section at a local library or school) please
let William Fishburne (william.fishburne@verizon.net) know!
The computers are physically in Northern Virginia and if you are not,
it would be necessary for you to arrange for the shipping cost.
Please send in your thoughts and ideas on how PG can make best use
of this dated windfall!  There are no boxes for most of these, so it
would be MUCH easier to organize a sort of "bucket-brigade" of people
who COULD get to the DC area [20 miles down towards Manassas] and get
some of these a day or two closer to others who may be able to make a
trip part way to get them, etc., etc., etc.  These are GREAT for any
wordprocessing, etc. . .it's just about exactly what I am using here,
for all my Project Gutenberg work.  However, these are NOT good for
the "bloatware" operating systems and programs if you are going to
reload and reboot a lot. . .takes some real time for this.  However,
I scanned the first books I ever OCRed on something much slower. . . .


***

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list: http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to: http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

Statistical Review

(This number includes the etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)


In the first 10 weeks of the new year, we have produced 604 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production.

With 7347 eTexts online as of March 12, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.36 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.10 when we had 4769 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7347 books each costing $0.74 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7347 books each costing 35% less a year later???


At 7347 eBooks in 31 Years We Averaged 19.75 eBooks per month

At 604 eBooks Done in 2003 We Averaged 69.00 eBooks per month

Headlines From Newsscan:

THE IETF APPROACH TO SPAM
The Internet Research Task Force -- loosely affiliated with the Internet
Engineering Task Force standards group -- has formed an Anti-Spam Research
Group, which will focus on the problem of spam proliferation and make
suggestions on ways to change basic e-mail technology to foil the bulk
e-mailers. "Once considered a nuisance, spam has grown to account for a
large percentage of the mail volume on the Internet," says the group's Web
site. "The purpose of the [research group] is to understand the problem and
collectively propose and evaluate solutions to the problem." First steps
will include classifying different kinds of spam and antispam proposals,
and studying ways to track down spammers, who are often difficult to
identify. A first meeting is set for March 20 at the IETF's San Francisco
gathering. (CNet News.com 6 Mar 2003)

THE AOL APPROACH TO SPAM
America Online, which says it blocks an average of 28 junk e-mail messages
per account per day, trashed a billion (presumably unsolicited) messages in
a two-day period this week, without letting them arrive at customers'
in-boxes. AOL spokesman Nicholas Graham asserts that only "an extremely
small fraction" of the messages trapped in AOL's spam filters are
legitimate communications. [We hope he's right. See the last message in
today's mailbag, which concerns NewsScan's experience with spam filters --
though not in this case AOL's.] (AP/San Jose Mercury News 6 Mar 2003)

THE AUSTRALIAN APPROACH TO SPAM
Clive Hamilton, the head of an Australian public think tank, thinks that
Australia's method of Internet regulation, managed by the Australian
Broadcasting Authority, is essentially useless. Referring to a survey
finding that 84% of boys ages 16-17 are exposed to pornography on the
Internet, Hamilton complained: "The Internet industry has convinced the
government that there is little that can be done to prevent pornography
coming in from overseas. But this is false. Mandatory filtering by Internet
service providers (ISPs) would severely restrict the availability of
pornography." Labor information technology spokeswoman Kate Luncy
disagrees: "The cost this would place on ISPs would be prohibitive and
Internet speeds would be significantly reduced. The end result for
consumers would be a slower, more expensive Internet." (The Age 4 Mar 2003)

WHY IS THIS NEWS? DOESN'T IT HAPPEN EVERY DAY?
A Colorado businessman was arrested earlier this week at his Sportsman's
Bar & Restaurant for firing four bullets into his laptop, which had crashed
just one too many times. After spending a night in jail, the man was
temporarily released but may face charges of felony menacing, reckless
endangerment, and the prohibited use of weapons. (AP/USA Today 5 Mar 2003)

SUSPECTS STEAL MONEY VIA KEYSTROKE MONITORING SOFTWARE
Two Japanese men were arrested for allegedly hacking into people's bank
accounts and stealing $136,000. The men are accused of downloading software
that detects the keystrokes made by a computer user and installed it on PCs
at Tokyo cybercaf=E9s. They then figured out the passwords that five=
 previous
customers had used to access their bank accounts online, and transferred a
total of $141,000 from those accounts to another bank. One of the men,
27-year-old Goro Nakahashi, then used an alias to withdraw $136,000. If
charged with theft, the two could face up to 10 years in prison. According
to the Asahi newspaper, the men allegedly tried to use about 100 computers
at 13 different Internet cafes around Tokyo. (AP 7 Mar 2003)

TWO JUDGES REJECT FBI TESTIMONY IN INTERNET PORN CASES
Federal district judges Denny Chin in New York and Catherine D. Perry in
St. Louis have rejected evidence obtained by FBI agents who claimed falsely
that anyone signing up with the child porn site "Candyman" would
automatically receive child porn images from other site members. Later, the
agents admitted that people signing up for the group had the ability to opt
out of the member mailing list and therefore did not necessarily receive
pornography through that list. Judge Chin wrote: "If the government is
correct in its position that membership in the Candyman group alone was
sufficient to support a finding of probable cause, then probable cause
existed to intrude into the homes" of thousands of people who had merely
logged onto that Web site. "Here, the intrusion is potentially enormous.
Thousands of individuals would be subject to search, their homes invaded
and their property seized, in one fell swoop, even though their only
activity consisted of entering an e-mail address into a Web site from a
computer located in the confines of their homes." (New York Times 7 Mar=

STARTUP LOADS MP3 TUNES ONTO CELL PHONES
A small startup called Xingtone has developed technology that enables
people to load MP3 files onto their cell phones. The user would take an
audio clip of a recording they already own, load it through the conversion
filter and deliver it to their phone. "It's a simple choice: Do people want
their phone to sound like an old arcade game or a radio playing their
favorite songs?" says Xingtone's Brad Zutaut, who currently has a snippet
of the Rolling Stones' "Get Off of My Cloud" on his phone. About 3,000
people have already used the service, which launched a few weeks ago.
Currently, wireless carriers limit clips to 30 seconds, but Xingtone says
as soon as the operators relax these restrictions, it has the capability to
send entire songs to users' cell phones. As an added twist, users can send
their audio clips from the Xingtone Web site to their friends' phones.
Zutaut acknowledges that the new service may raise the ire of the music
industry. "I know that we'll have licensing issues. But if people take
their own music and put it on their phone, it's not my responsibility." He
sees potential revenue streams from eventually moving toward a pay-per-use
model and from co-branding. (Reuters/CNet 7 Mar 2003)

INTEL BETS BIG ON WI-FI
Intel is investing in four Wi-Fi firms in an effort to boost the wireless
technology and build demand for its Centrino chipset, which offers Wi-Fi
connectivity and improved notebook battery life. Financial terms were not
disclosed, but last October Intel had announced plans to invest $150
million in companies pursuing Wi-Fi technology and so far has funded seven
ventures. The latest recipients of Intel's largess are rovingIP.net,
Vivato, Broadreach Networks and Pronto Networks. In December, Intel teamed
up with AT&T and IBM to form Cometa Networks, which will create a
nationwide network of wireless broadband hotspots in stores, restaurants,
hotels, gas stations and other public venues. (Reuters/CNet 9 Mar 2003)

THE FUTURE OF WEBLOGS
Blogging, which a few years ago was viewed as a lot of inconsequential
chatter, is morphing into a cutting-edge phenomenon that may provide a
platform for the Internet's next wave of innovation and moneymaking
opportunities. "Just like the Internet was 10 years ago, blogging is
popular with an underground culture that is doing it for the love and
passion," says Tony Perkins, editor of the recently folded Red Herring
magazine. "Now there are people like me coming along and trying to figure
out how to package it. It's time to take it to the next level." Other heavy
hitters hoping to cash in on the Web's so-called "Blogosphere" include
Terra Lycos, AOL and Google. Last month, Terra introduced publishing tools
to help users launch their own blogs, and AOL plans a similar move later
this year. Meanwhile, Google just snapped up Pyra Labs, which runs
Blogger.com, a network of Weblogs boasting more than 1 million members and
more than 200,000 active blogs. "We want to take what has been an
underground phenomenon and introduce it to the masses," says Charles Kilby,
Terra Lycos' director of product marketing. "This is the 'eBayization' of
the media," says Perkins. "You create a compelling arena and then let the
real entertainment come from the participants themselves." (AP 9 Mar 2003)

AOL'S ANSWER TO TIVO TO BE LIKE TIVO, SORT OF
Recognizing the threat TiVo and similar personal video recording technology
is posing to TV networks and Hollywood studios, AOL Time Warner has been
secretly developing its own version of the technology, called Mystro TV.
Mystro uses the cable system itself to let viewers watch programs on their
own schedules (just as TiVo does), but it lets networks retain a level of
control (dictating which shows users can reschedule) and offers them a way
to insert commercials, which TiVo allows its set-owners to avoid. (New York
Times 10 Mar 2003)

LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH DIGITAL COPYING RIGHTS
Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D, CA) is reintroducing legislation called the Balance
Act, intended to give people the right to make back-up copies of copyrighted
digital works for use on other devices (such as car CD players) and to
protect consumers who break technological locks in order to view DVD movies
on their computers. Lofgren says, "Most people -- at least, most adults --
don't expect to get content as a freebie. But when people pay good money to
buy something and then can't use it in the way they've become accustomed to,
it makes them mad." The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the
Business Software Alliance (BSA) strongly oppose the proposed legislation,
which is thought to have just a long-shot chance of being passed. Arguing
that such legislation "would provide safe harbor for pirates," Jack Valenti
of the MPAA said, "As drafted, this legislation essentially legalizes
hacking." (San Jose Mercury News 11 Mar 2003)

DELOADER WORM ATTACKS EASY-TO-GUESS PASSWORDS
A new software worm called W32/Deloader-A tries to guess passwords on
machines running many of the Microsoft Windows operating systems: it
attempts to log on to a machine's administrator account by trying likely
passwords such as 'admin', 'password,' '12345', and 'administrator', and so
forth. The worm is thought to have originated in China. Although Deloader is
considered a low risk for infection, many home computers without firewalls
may be vulnerable to its attacks. (IDG/Computerworld 11 Mar 2003) Shorl:

AT THE BEND IT'S ORACLE, THEN IBM, MICROSOFT, AND NOBODY
Looking at the relational database market, industry analyst Carl Olofson
describes the current situation by noting that "the gap between Oracle and
IBM is narrowing, Microsoft continues to grow, and the three of them are
increasingly well ahead of the rest of the field." Market shares now are
Oracle 39.4%, IBM 33.6%, and Microsoft 11.1%. Compared to market shares a
year ago, Oracle is down 2.3% while IBM is up 2.6% and Microsoft is up by
1.4%. Olofson says that IBM's gain is due largely because many of its
corporate customers (unlike Oracle's customers) are required to renew their
licenses each year. Another factor in the equation is that IBM seems to be
expanding its share of Windows, Unix and Linux environments more rapidly
than Oracle. (San Francisco Chronicle 11 Mar 2003)

DETAILS REVEALED ABOUT GOVERNMENT DATA MINING
A freedom-of-information request by the Electronic Privacy Information
Center (EPIC) has uncovered information about 26 research grants
awarded for the Defense Department's controversial Total Information
Awareness (TIA) program. The Defense Department tried to block the
release of the grant information, but a federal district court ruled
that the information must be turned over. Future funding for the TIA
program has been blocked by Congress, pending an accounting of how the
program will deal with privacy issues. The grants described were
approved before Congress took action to limit funding. Grant applicants
included large and small corporations and large research universities.
According to EPIC, the grant program solicited proposals dealing with
repository technologies; collaboration, automation, and cognitive aids
technologies; and prototype system technologies.

NEW SPAM FILTER ONLY DELIVERS E-MAIL FROM APPROVED SOURCES
The co-founders of AvantGo this week unveiled a new spam filter called
Qurb that aims to provide users with strict restrictions on spam by
combining a "whitelist" of approved senders with a challenge/response
mechanism. E-mail coming from a source not included on the user's
whitelist is automatically routed to a "quarantine" folder, where users
can look for legitimate mail. Mail from someone not on the list
triggers a challenge e-mail to that sender, who can choose to respond,
thereby affirming that he or she is the real sender of that message.
The Qurb user can then add that sender to the whitelist. The makers of
Qurb say the tool is difficult for spammers to sidestep while being
relatively simple for legitimate correspondents to negotiate. Critics
said restrictions like those of Qurb are too strict and onerous for
most users to use easily. Spam consultant Steve Atkins said Qurb won't
save much time because most users will look through the quarantine
folder for legitimate mail. He said there are other systems already
available that function similarly and that no one uses them.

ALEXANDRIA LIBRARY PROJECT TO BUILD VAST ONLINE COLLECTION
A project at the new Alexandria Library in Egypt hopes to make
virtually every existing text available online. The Alexandria Library
Scholars Collective uses software called CyberBook Plus designed to
link archives of digital texts from around the world. In addition to
offering a single point of entry to access most of the world's texts,
the software includes virtual lecture halls, a hub for international
scholars, and a gateway for ordinary readers. David Wolff of
online-learning venture Fathom noted that doing any one of these
successfully would be challenging. The challenges confronting the
project include copyright, language barriers, and funding. The
project's primary sources of funding are currently the Egyptian
government and UNESCO.

EXPERTS FIND FAULT WITH CURRENT COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION
Experts speaking at a University of California at Berkeley conference
were in general agreement that copyright law is currently being applied
inappropriately. The event featured speakers from a range of companies
and institutions, representing a variety of perspectives on the issue
of copyright. Most speakers faulted the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (DMCA) and its application, saying the interests of the majority of
persons involved are not being served. Notable DMCA opponents Larry
Lessig and Edward Felten spoke out against the current state of
copyright enforcement. Alex Alben of RealNetworks also attended the
conference. He criticized a recent action by Lexmark, which has won a
preliminary injunction under the terms of the DMCA to prevent a
competitor from selling a chip that would allow Lexmark printers to
function with non-Lexmark toner cartridges. "This is a travesty," Alben
said. "This is not what we intended when we created the DMCA."

SENATOR OFFERS MARKET APPROACH TO COPYRIGHT
Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) has suggested that the answer to ongoing
wrangling over copyright is a policy of full disclosure. If content
producers are required to explain clearly to consumers how and under
what conditions a copyrighted work can be used or copied, users can
easily decide whether they will buy it. Wyden said his approach is a
market-based one; although the government would have to specify and
enforce disclosure provisions, market forces would compel action on the
part of media companies to keep consumers. Wyden argued that the
current influence of media companies on Congress will prevent any
legislative alteration of copyright law from passing any time soon.
