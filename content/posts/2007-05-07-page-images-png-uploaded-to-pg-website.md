Recently Joshua Hutchinson has been uploading eBook pages images (as PNG format) to the PG website.

For example;

The page images of Spacehounds of IPC, by Edward Elmer Smith are in the folder;
<http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/0/8/5/20857/20857-page-images/>

The "system" used to number page images is as follows;

**Covers** (front and back) and the illustrated inside covers and marked = **cXXX.png**

**Front matter** (title pages, contents, introduction, preface, etc) = **fXXX.png**

**Main body** = **pXXX.png**

**End matter** (index, appendix, etc) [only if number starts over] = **zXXX.png**

**Images inserted** without a page number are given the closest page number with -insert extension (ie, **p100-insert.png**)

Images scanned at a **higher res** from the rest of its page in a separate file get -image extension (ie, **p100-image.png**)

Currently, Josh is only grabbing images from the [Distributed Proofreaders](http://www.pgdp.net) archives (for images we have permission to reuse like this). If anyone has images from other locations they want to add please contact Josh at jhutch2000@gmail.com.
