* Distributed Proofreaders 15th Anniversary

Distributed Proofreaders celebrates its 15th Anniversary and digitizes
30,000th public domain book.

Succasunna, NJ -- Distributed Proofreaders (http://www.pgdp.net) is
celebrating both its 15th Anniversary and the digitization of its 30,000th
unique public domain e-book. Founded 1 October 2000, Distributed
Proofreaders is a crowdsourced website whose volunteers convert books to
electronic formats and make them available for free distribution via
Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org).

The 30,000 e-books we've produced represent a wide variety of literature
including Science, Technology, Medicine, Poetry, Archaeology, Folklore,
Literature, Drama, Music, History, Autobiography, Political Science, and
General and Juvenile Fiction. Titles include the works of Dickens and
Shakespeare, Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope, MoliÃ¨re and Goethe. And
Distributed Proofreaders produces e-books in several languages in addition
to English, including French, German, Italian, Spanish, Tagalog,
Esperanto, and others.

About Distributed Proofreaders

Established 15 years ago, Distributed Proofreaders (http://www.pgdp.net)
uses crowdsourcing to convert public domain paper books into e-books and
distributes them to the world via Project Gutenberg
(http://www.gutenberg.org). Distributed Proofreaders is a recognized
affiliate of Project Gutenberg and is the main source of Project
Gutenberg's e-books. All our proofreaders, managers, developers, etc. are
unpaid volunteers.

Distributed Proofreaders has over 129,000 registered volunteers from
countries around the globe, including the United States, Canada, Britain,
France, Spain, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand. It uses a crowdsourced
solution to digitize the books, with each volunteer doing a specific
portion of the work, sometimes no more than proofreading a single page.

Once the images of the pages of a book have been scanned into a computer,
those scans are converted to text by optical character recognition
programs.  Then the volunteers proofread and correct the computer text
page by page using a specially-created web-based interface that divides
the workload into individual pages so that many volunteers can work on a
book at the same time. This process significantly speeds up the
digitization process, and, since the volunteers are situated in different
countries, the work goes on round the clock.

Distributed Proofreaders has many different types of volunteers. Some scan
books and prepare them for proofreading, some proofread page by page, some
format the pages (marking text that is bold or italic, etc.), some prepare
the final full book (including illustrations and even music), and some
read the ready-to-be submitted book to make sure that we haven't missed
anything.

Our work won't stop at 30,000 -- we'll continue to work together to
digitize copyright-free e-books. And we welcome new volunteers!

General Manager and Distributed Proofreaders Foundation

In keeping with the international culture of this organization, the
General Manager is Canadian and runs the operational aspect of this large
initiative from Toronto. The Distributed Proofreaders Foundation Board of
Trustees is currently made up of people from the United States, New
Zealand, and Germany.

* Project Hart

Project Hart is a nonprofit created in the legacy of Michael Hart,
founder of Project Gutenberg.  Our mission is to make ebooks
accessible for everyone.  There are so many free ebooks in this world,
but many people do not have the computers or internet to access these
digital libraries.  Project Hart aims to solve this issue by giving
ereaders full of ebooks to people in need. We plan to do this through
raising funds to buy ereaders and receiving donations of used
ereaders.  To learn more or help our cause you can:

Thank you for your interest in Project Hart!


* The TPP is passed, and not ratified

Project Gutenberg is concerned about a new international treaty, the
Trans-Pacific Partnership.  It has been reported as completed, but the
countries involved still need to ratify the treaty for it to apply to
that country.  There is still time to resist the negative impact on
the Public Domain, within each country.  The near-final text, with
analysis, is available from WikiLeaks: https://wikileaks.org/tpp-ip3/
and the Electronic Frontier Foundation: https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp
