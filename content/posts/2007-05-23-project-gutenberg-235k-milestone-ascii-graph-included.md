Project Gutenberg passes another eBooks milestone today, over 23,500 eBooks that have been created by the Project Gutenberg army of volunteers. . . .****

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>!!!!!!!My HUGE Congratulations to all the volunteers!!!!!!!</strong>
</p>

This is including over 1500 contributions from Project Gutenberg Australia, and about 500 from Project Gutenberg Europe, but DOES NOT INCLUDE well over 75,000 eBooks dontated via http://www.gutenberg.cc to the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, for a grand total of 100,000 eBooks.

Here is the ASCII graph of the PG growth curve since the first schedule for eBook production was introduced as 1990 gave way to 1991.

Note, the margins may be broken by various emailers, so I am also including the graph in an attachment for which you can hopefully set the margins.

Please note that many duplications have been detected and removed, between the various Project Gutenberg sites between 2006 and 2007, so the curve is appearing somewhat less for 2007 than under the old accounting system.

Again, HUGE thanks to all the Project Gutenberg volunteers, of all time!!!
