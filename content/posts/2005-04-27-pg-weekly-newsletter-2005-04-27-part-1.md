users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.


*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics

CIA's Electronic Reading Room,      2,019 Reference Files
=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 16,107 eBooks online as of April 27, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.96 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,379,848 [x 16,107 x $.97 = ~$1 trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 16,107 eBooks online as of April 27, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.62 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.80 when we had 12,486 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 16,107 eBooks in 33 Years and 09.75 Months We Averaged
      ~476 Per Year
        39.7 Per Month
         1.30 Per Day

At 1151 eBooks Done In The 112 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      10.28 Per Day
      72 Per Week
     307 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

FEWER COLLEGE STUDENTS PURSUING COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREES

[Because of the .com bust]

A new report from the Computing Research Association (CRA) shows a
significant drop in the number of college freshmen in the United States
who say they plan to major in computer science. The CRA looked at data
from the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of
California at Los Angeles and found that between fall of 2000 and fall
of 2004, interest in computer science fell by more than 60 percent and
is now 70 percent below its all-time high. Interest among women has
fallen even further, said the CRA, dropping 80 percent since 1998 and
93 percent since 1982. The CRA also conducted surveys of higher
education institutions and came up with similar results. The report
goes on to suggest that the United States will have difficulty meeting
the demand for IT workers in coming years, increasing the gap with
countries including India and China that are producing larger numbers
of computer science graduates. "Freshmen interest levels at any given
point have been an accurate predictor of trends in the number of
degrees granted four to five years later," according to the report.

ISU CONSIDERS LAPTOP REQUIREMENT

[For students, not for faculty]

The Faculty Senate at Indiana State University (ISU) has put its
support behind a proposal to require incoming freshmen to purchase
laptops beginning in the fall of 2007. Under the proposal, written by a
university committee, the university would recommend a particular
model, which would be available at reduced cost, though students could
obtain a waiver that would allow them to purchase a different model.
Officials at ISU noted that most students already have a computer and
said that the requirement would allow the university to see advantages
from having standardized systems that could be incorporated into
academic programs. Critics of the proposal pointed out that faculty
would not be required to use computers in their classes. Concerns over
the added cost to students were also raised by students and faculty who
oppose the plan, while others said having computers in class could be a
significant distraction.

GOOGLE TRIES NEW AD PROGRAM

[More ads, flashier ads, longer download times]

Internet search engine Google has implemented changes to its ad program
that allow advertisers more options for what their ads look like and
where they appear. Initially at least, the new ads will not appear on
Google's own sites but will potentially be included on the thousands
of sites to which Google provides ads. Until now, Google ads were
textual, and Google only placed ads on sites that were related to the
advertised product or service. A Web site about wine, for instance,
might get ads from Google about other wines, cheese, or other directly
relevant topics. Under the new program, Google will allow graphical
elements, including some animation and video, and advertisers can
decide which Web sites will display their ads. The program changes the
model from a pay-per-click arrangement to one in which advertisers pay
simply to show an ad.

The long-awaited .eu Internet domain will be operational by the end of
2005, according to officials of the European Union. Supporters of the
domain name have been working for six years to reach an agreement under
which the domain can be launched. Representatives of the European Union
believe the new domain will provide a sense of identity on the Internet
for organizations based around Europe, though it will not replace
existing country-specific domains, such as .uk or .de. In an effort to
limit cybersquatting of names in the domain, new domain names will only
be granted to companies and trademark owners for the first four months.
Members of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European
Union, advised that all offers of early registration for the domain
could well be fraudulent and should be treated with skepticism.

JUDGE REJECTS RIAA'S EXPEDITED SUBPOENAS
A federal judge in North Carolina handed the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) a legal defeat in its effort to learn the
identities of two students accused of illegal file sharing. The RIAA
had sought the identities from the students' universities, the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State
University, under an expedited subpoena process the group has since
abandoned. In a December 2003 decision, another federal judge had
rejected the expedited subpoenas, which did not require a judge's
signature, ruling that Verizon could not be forced to disclose
identities of its customers. In their capacity as Internet service
providers (ISPs) for students, universities were given similar
protection from the expedited subpoenas. In this case, Judge Russell A.
Eliason ruled that an ISP that does not store information but merely
transmits it cannot be compelled under the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act to reveal identities of its users. After the 2003 decision, the
RIAA began filing individual "John Doe" lawsuits for illegal file
sharing. Under that process, which costs the RIAA more time and money
than the other, ISPs can be forced to turn over identities of users.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

No follow up on the huge Texas City oil refinery explosion.

No Weapons of Mass Destruction

Yesterday it was announced that the search for the alleged
weapons of mass destruction whose suspected presence was
the official reason for the U.S. invasion of Iraq ended.
After millions of man-hours all leads have been exhausted
and no WMDs or further leads have been discovered.  [NPR]

*

In a separate news conference, the official statements of
the new intelligence community leadership under Negroponte
indicate that the two greatest failures of U.S. intelligence
were missing the 9/11 attacks and being duped into thinking
there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.


*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice said in Russia that there
was too much power in the Kremlin and not enough independent
news media in Russia.

It would seem others are saying the same thing about the U.S.
White House gaining too much power and a similar decline in a
previously strong independent media in the U.S.



DOUBLESPEAK OF THE DAY

The richest man in Italy says that Prime Minister Berlusconi
resigned due to pressure from a biased liberal media.

He neglected to say that he owns 90% of the Italian media in
which he voices a conservative point of view.

By the way, that richest man in Italy. . .is Berlusconi. . .

The Bush Administration came out on the side of family rights
to decide on who decides to "pull the plug" in hospitial care,
but 1998 Bush signed a Texas law that took such decisions out
of the hands of the family.

The new Pope said that his job was to defend the church
against "the monstrous terrorism of modernism."



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

U.S. car sales will continue to go down, while U.S. home
sales will continue to go up.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Even while announcing that inflation has been curbed, numbers
are being released that show 30% higher inflation for 2005 in
the first quarter than the annual rate for 2004.

  .6% Inflation for March, 2005  [7.5% Annual Rate]
3.3% Inflation for 2004 [Annual Rate]
4.3% Inflation for 2005 [First Quarter]

Cost Price Index = CPI

Speaking of inflation, how many of you know "grade inflation?"

This is a trend caused by schools refusing to flunk out those
who can't even read so they can receive more money through an
assortment of per capita subsidies, athletic program tickets,
and various other reasons.

Even counting that half the students never make it to a degree
in four years, or even if extended to five years, the average
grades given in most colleges has been higher than a "B" quite
some time, and is still inching up.

Thus a "B" is now "below average" even though a "C" is supposed
to represent "average."

This trend, when compounded by the fact that more and more people
are receiving college degrees, which should bring the average way
down as more than the best students enroll, means that inflation
of grades is even more intense that previously thought, as these
grade would have to be inflated even more to discount the average
of the greater number of midrange students.

Approximately 1/3 of all U.S. young people get a college education
in modern times, a much greater number than the 14% I remember for
the period when I was researching colleges.  Does anyone have some
statistics for the total U.S. % with college degrees?

*

56% of all U.S. college graduates are women.
Even more for those receiving advanced degrees.

*

Drug Pushers

There is one commercial drug rep for every 6.8 Drs in the US.

*

25-30% of high school and middle school students can't read.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
