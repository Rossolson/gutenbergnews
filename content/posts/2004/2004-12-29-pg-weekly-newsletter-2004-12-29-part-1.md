HEADLINE NEWS!!!

&gt;From NewsScan:

[For all those who never pay attention to such things, this means:

THE PERCENTAGE OF BROADBAND USERS IN THE U.S. CAN NEVER DOUBLE AGAIN!

Don't expect to ever hear the previous growth rates again. . . .
Nobody paid any attention to this when U.S. Internet use reached 50%,
and that. . .created the big .com crash. . . !!!]

BROADBAND SURPASSES DIALUP IN THE U.S.
The number of broadband Internet connections in U.S. households has
finally surpassed that of dialup, accounting for 53% of residential users
in October according to Nielsen/NetRatings. The prevalence of "always-on"
broadband leads to higher usage rates as high-speed users subscribe to the
practice of "infosnacking," says AOL executive VP Jim Bankoff: "People are
more able and willing to just walk up to the Internet to get a quick
snippet of what they need, send a quick e-mail, read a quick news article,
check a sports score." That instant availability has changed communal
behavior, says Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet & American Life
Project. Family members arguing over a point are more apt to "look it up
online rather than continue to yell at each other," says Rainie, who notes
his high-speed bandwidth at home has also changed his offline behavior --
he gets to the office late and leaves early in order to avoid rush-hour
traffic, knowing that he can accomplish what he needs to do in his hours at
home. (AP 21 Dec 2004)

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, eg.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

We are in the process of rewriting some of the general FAQs and
would appreciate help proofreading them over the next few months.

We've added some new FAQs and generally updated information
about Project Gutenberg.  Take a look, and email Michael or
Greg with any suggestions or corrections.  We'll have these
updated from time to time, now that we've passed #10,000.
A new set of these will be in the works when we pass #20,000.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 51 weeks of this year, we have produced 3,960 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 3,960 eBooks!!!

          That's 51 WEEKS as Compared to ~31.5 YEARS!!!


FLASHBACK!

Here's a sample of what books we were doing around eBook #3960

The Entire Series of "The French Immortal" Authors, up to #4000


With 14,867 eBooks online as of December 29, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.67 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $.93 when we had 10,750 eBooks a year ago

Can you imagine ~14,867 books each costing ~$.25 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~14,867 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 14,867 eBooks in 33 Years and 05.80 Months We Averaged
       444 Per Year   [We do about 3/4 that much per month these days!]
        37.0 Per Month
         1.22 Per Day

At 3960 eBooks Done In The 357 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11 Per Day
      78 Per Week
     336 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

*Headline News from NewsScan and Edupage

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

[There haven't been many issues of Newsscan and Edupage
recently, due to the holidays, so very few articles here.
Don't miss the one way up at the very beginning.]


EU COURT RULES AGAINST MICROSOFT
A European Union judge today ruled that Microsoft must immediately
submit to sanctions imposed by EC regulators after they found that
Microsoft broke antitrust laws by integrating its Windows Media Player into
Windows, thus putting rival media software companies at a disadvantage.
Microsoft had appealed the initial decision, arguing that pulling Media
Player out of Windows would degrade its performance, but in today's ruling,
Chief Judge Bo Vesterdorf of the Court of First Instance found that
postponing sanctions would give Microsoft time to strengthen its grip on
the market for media playing applications. Microsoft must now create two
versions of Windows for European distribution -- one that contains Media
Player and one without. Microsoft announced it would comply while
contemplating its next legal move. (Washington Post 22 Dec 2004)

&gt;From Edupage

MICROSOFT MUST ACCEPT EU SANCTIONS
The president of the European Union's Court of First Instance ruled
that Microsoft must abide by sanctions imposed by EU regulators pending
the results of an appeal. The sanctions require Microsoft to provide a
version of its Windows operating system that does not include the
company's Media Player software. Microsoft also must publish
application programming interfaces to allow competitors to create
server products compatible with Windows. The court ruled that Microsoft
failed to prove that meeting the sanctions would cause "serious and
irreparable harm" to its business.

TECHNOLOGY REVIEW



*Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media



*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

"We are less generous now that we are more rich."
Jan Egeland, UN emergency relief coordinator.

[This is the quotation I wrote down directly when I
heard it on the air, but I notice it doesn't appear
in any of my searches, rather the word "stingy" is
the main word used, and wanting higher taxes to get
more relief.  I recall, hopefully correctly, that I
wrote the quote from The News Hour with Jim Lehrer.
However, this quote didn't come up in ANY searches,
but was rather replaced more the more sensational:

"It is beyond me why are we so stingy, really,"
"Christmastime should remind  many Western countries
at least, how rich we have become."

[Please not he used "we" above, and only used "they"
when replying to specific complaints he received.]

"There are several donors who are less generous than
before in a growing world economy," and that officials
are saying "the taxpayers want to give less. It's not true.
They want to give more."]

No similar comments were raised against the BBC comments
that current relief efforts would be small enough for the
immediate responses, and forgotten soon enough that many
of the victims would be still living in temporary shelters
a year from now.

You may also want to note that this is possibly the
greatest natural disaster in recorded history, as the
massive Krakatoa eruption of 1883 only killed 40,000,
most by the same sort of tsunamis as in this catastrophe.
By comparison, the number killed in Pompeii was perhaps
2,000, with perhaps another several thousand in nearby
Herculaneum and their surroundings.

The official count for this one had already passed
50,000 24 hours before our deadline, with another 50,000
expected to be added as more bodies are found and second
stage deaths take place from injuries, lack of supplies,
and an expected resulting empidemic from lack of food
and clean water.


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

The responses to Jan Egeland's statements will continue
to be of the tabloid nature, completely ignoring facts
that pledged donations at the time were much smaller
than those reported after the effect of his statement,
but reported as if they were that large before.

[When I heard the first report of the U.S. pledging
3.5 million dollars, I actually thought they meant
3.5 billion dollars. . .a fraction of the amount spent
to rebuild Florida after the four hurricanes this year.
Apparently the total cost to insurance companies alone
has been over $20 billion, not to mention all the costs
not borne by insurance.]


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

[For those of you who still refuse to believe that the rich
are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. . . .]

Economic reports for holiday sales indicate that the stores
catering to the upper classes did quite well, while classes
of a less wealthy nature spent much less at discount stores.
In addition, the post-Chrismas rush expected the days after

More on TIMSS

TIMSS = Third International Mathematics and Science Study

Three weeks ago nearly every new service had positive comments
about the improved U.S. students' TIMSS test scores that come
out every four years.  Only one source I heard had the nerve
to say that the scores didn't really show any improvement,
while the rest seemed to reek of jingoism.

However, in reviewing the scores, it seems obvious that the
U.S. test scores in question, the 8th grade math scores,
were basically unchanged, moving up less than 1% from the
1999 score of 500 to the 2003 score of 504, out of 800.

This represents a change of 1/5 of 1% per year, which I
seriously doubt is within the statistical parameters of
the TIMSS testing methodologies.  [This is 1/8% if you
measure from the total of 800 points, or a 1/2% total
change over the four year period, an increment these
kinds of tests are not reported to target.]

Much more likely is the fact that the U.S. ranking has
been changed more by changes in the other countries,
both in terms of the changes the countries chosen for
the 2003 tests, and the performance changes of those
countries that stayed the same.

More details of score changes in the top 20 of 1999:

Rank Country            1999/2003  Change

1/1   Singapore           643/605  =  38
2/2   Korea               607/589  =  18
3/5   Japan               605/570  =  35
4/3   Hong Kong           588/586  =   3
6/6   Belgium (Fl)        565/537  =  28
7/13  Slovak Republic     547/508  =  39
9/7   Netherlands         541/536  =   5
9/21  Slovenia            541/493  =  48
[Netherlands and Slovenia tied in 1999]
11/25 Bulgaria            540/476  =  66
14/9  Hungary             537/529  =   7
16/14 Australia           530/505  =  25

Avg. of 11 listed here:   568/539  =  29

Change in U.S. Score:     500/504  =   4

Change in U.S. Rank        28/15   =  13

Obviously the other countries changed much more than the U.S.,
over 7 times as much change, not to mention that many of the
countries tested in 1999 were not tested in 2003, a factor of
change much greater than that of the U.S. performance change.

Thus we see that that most other countries changed
much more than did the U.S., which changed very little.
It would appear that the U.S. didn't really move on the
charts so much as other countries moved up and down past
the U.S.

In addition, it appears that the science scores were not
mentioned in these news reports, nor were the scores for
students in the lower grade classes.  I will have to dig
them up to let you know more about them in later issues.
