*Nanotechnology : A commentary from Bill Hammack's public radio program
You can listen to this commentary at http://www.engineerguy.com

With nanotechnology engineers manipulate atomic sized particles
to create tiny machines. They'll be able to create, for example,
toothpaste filled with nano-particles that repair damaged teeth,
or pills that are really tiny pacemakers. Although still a young
technology, the National Science Foundation forecasts the U.S.
Market will be one trillion dollars by 2016.

Yet this promise may never be fulfilled, but not for lack of
technological know how or resources: The U.S. Government alone
will pour 3.7 billion dollars into nanotech over the next four
year. But to really thrive a technology needs more than a
scientific side, it must fit into our world socially and legally.
For nanotech storm clouds already loom on the horizon.

For example, Britain's Prince Charles suggested that
nanotechnology could be a disaster like thalidomide - the drug
that caused grotesque birth defects in the 1960s. His remarks
signal to the nanotech community the work yet to be done in
creating a public receptive to their technology.

I suggest they look carefully at two negative role models:
Biotechnology and nuclear power. Nether industry conveyed to the
public the benefit of their product, nor did they listen to
public concerns. In the absence of intelligent dialogue,
heightened concerns grew over the risk, nearly crippling both
industries. Better public engagement could have prevented this
backlash. The public isn't going to accept any technology where
there hasn't been detailed studies of risks and benefits.

Right now the lack of information about nanotechnology invites
alarmist scenarios. The nanotech industry needs to educate the
public about what exactly nanotechnology is, and it needs to
listen carefully to public concerns.

And there are other ways nanotech needs to fit into our world
before being fully accepted - consider legal and regulatory
aspects. The EPA is deciding whether to regulate nano-materials
under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or to classify them as
the naturally occurring "ultra-fine" materials - the same as
dust, forest fire smoke, volcanic ash, bacteria and viruses.

And Patent Examiners are grappling with nanotech. If you use nano
methods to make a tiny motor is that legally any different than a
full-sized motor? In the past a simple change in size hasn't been
patentable absent some other utility or novelty that comes from

To researchers who enjoy conquering the technological problems of
creating a nanotech world, these social, legal and regulatory
concerns may seem like dull things. Yet, some fraction of the
nearly four billion dollars being invested into nanotechnology
needs to be used to answer these questions. If not then these
tiny nano-sized machines will bite back big time.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned).  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

Statistical Review

In the 35 weeks of this year, we have produced 2824 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our FIRST 2824 eBooks!!!

          That's 35 WEEKS as Compared to ~30 YEARS!!!


With 13,731 eBooks online as of September 8, 2004 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.73 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.07 when we had 9327 eBooks a year ago

Can you imagine ~13,731 books each costing ~$.35 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine ~13,731 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 13,731 eBooks in 33 Years and 02.00 Months We Averaged
       414 Per Year   [We do nearly that much a month these days!]
        34.5 Per Month
         1.13 Per Day

At 2824 eBooks Done In The 251 Days Of 2004 We Averaged
      11.2 Per Day
      80.6 Per Week
     353.0 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 7th was
the first Wednesday of 2004, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2003 and began the production year of 2004 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.


                            *Flashback!!!

                   2820 New eBooks So Far in 2004

CYBERCAFE LOOKS BACK ON A TEN-YEAR REVOLUTION
Cafe Cyberia opened its doors ten years ago Wednesday in the heart of
London as the brainchild of a Polish psychology student who had the savvy
and foresight to combine coffee and e-mail. Eva Pascoe's cybercafe drew
raves immediately, along with investments from the likes of rock star Mick
Jagger. From the branch on Wiltshire Road, in London's bustling Tottenham
Court Road area, it spawned outlets across Britain and abroad, showing up
even inside Paris' Pompidou Center, the contemporary art museum in the heart
of the French capital. (The Age 3 Sep 2004) Rec'd from J. Lamp

MALAYSIA SEEKS TO BECOME TOP OUTSOURCING CENTER
Malaysia prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi says that outsourcing
operations have emerged as one of the largest sectors in Malaysia's
Multimedia Super Corridor, spawning investment of more than one billion
ringgit by 49 companies and some 8,000 new jobs in the special zone south of
Kuala Lumpur. The sector would play a key role in the zone's second phase of
development from 2004 to 2010, creating at least 100,000 new jobs by the end
of the period. (The Age 2 Sep 2004) Rec'd from J. Lamp

"INDIAN" OUTSOURCERS COULD BE ANYWHERE
India's back-office service providers have been establishing operations
in other parts of the world: an Infosys subsidiary has opened offices in the
Czech republic and MphasiS BFL's arm MSourcE has created a processing center
in Mexico. Raju Bhatnagar, president of ICICI OneSource, explains: "It is
more from a customer perspective. If the vendor, however reliable, has a
single delivery center, it forces the customer to look for a second vendor
outside India, rather than put all his eggs in one basket. If I can bridge
that gap, I can keep business from going to another vendor."

[Speaking of outsourcing, I heard that "call centers" are now going up
in Eastern Europe as various countries join NATO and start using Euros]

LABOR SECRETARY DEFENDS OUTSOURCING
In defense of outsourcing, which has been under much attack in this
political year, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao says that companies have created
millions of jobs in the United States, far outpacing the amount of work that
American businesses have shifted abroad. "People talk about it a lot, but
the anxiety belies the numbers." Noting that we live and work in a worldwide
economy, Chao warns: "If we isolate ourselves from this worldwide economy,
we will put in jeopardy the 9 million jobs that Americans currently hold"
in foreign-owned companies. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 2 Sep 2004)

SPY VERSUS SPY: UNBLOCK THAT CALL-BLOCK
A new computerized service from a company called Star38 will allow
callers to create false outbound phone numbers and thereby fool call block
software. Customers of the new service will be able to go to the company's
Web site to enter the number they want to call and the number they want to
appear on the caller ID screen of the recipient's phone. Some privacy-rights
advocates are concerned that angry former spouses, stalkers or fraud artists
could use the service for mischief, but Robert Atkinson of the Institute for
Tele-Information at Columbia University, comments: "Some people see caller

FRANCE TELECOM EMPLOYEES PROTEST PRIVATIZATION PLANS
France Telecom employees have protested government plans to privatize
the group, with management characterizing the mobilization as modest and
unions describing it as robust resistance. Company officials say 18.3% of
the workforce heeded a union call for a 24-hour strike, while the SUD-PTT
union claims the figure was 25% and characterizes the response as
"significant." Another union, the CGT, says 30-70% of the workforce went out
on strike, with turnout varying among branches. The strike call followed an
announcement by the government that it will reduce its stake in France
Telecom to below 50%. (The Age 8 Sep 2004) Rec'd from J. Lamp

E-VOTING IN NEVADA
Nevada voters have become the first in the nation to cast ballots in a
statewide election using computers that produced printed paper records of
electronic ballots. "Knock on wood, so far things have been working
flawlessly," said Secretary of State Dean Heller. Nevada's $9.3 million
voting system includes more than 2,600 computers and printers deployed in
every county. The system, developed by California-based Sequoia Voting
Systems, aims to address concerns that paperless touchscreen votes cannot be
properly audited or recounted. "From what I've seen, voters seem to enjoy
the experience," says DeForest B. Soaries Jr., chairman of the U.S. Election
Assistance Commission. "There hasn't been frustration or confusion."(AP/USA

MARYLAND JUDGE OKAYS TOUCH-SCREEN VOTING

[Yes, but it's the UNREASONABLE ones who stuff the ballot boxes.]

Rejecting a challenge to the state's touch-screen voting machines, a
Circuit Court judge in Maryland suggests that the machines are more accurate
than the paper ballots the plaintiffs are seeking to make optional for the
November elections, and notes that election officials have "taken all
reasonable steps to protect the integrity of the voting process." The lead
plaintiff's response is: "I am very disappointed that Maryland voters will
be forced to vote on machines that we believe are illegal under Maryland law
and that are clearly very insecure." In his ruling the judge wrote: "No
system is infallible. No machine is infallible. All experts agree systems
such as these are much more secure and less vulnerable than the paper
ballot" -- or the optical scan machines used in most Maryland jurisdictions
in the last presidential election. (Washington Post 1 Sep 2004)

U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE DRAFTS NEW VERSION OF INDUCE ACT

[Right, Fortune 500 companies such as Sony and Apple can do it,
but the little guys face total destruction.]

Responding to strong criticism of the recently introduced Induce Act,
the U.S. Copyright Office has written a revised version of the
legislation. The "discussion draft" offered by the Copyright Office
attempts to shield devices such as Apple's iPod from prosecution for
inducing consumers to commit copyright violations while outlawing
networks such as Kazaa and Morpheus for doing just that. The draft
limits liability to those who "intentionally induce" piracy--a more
stringent definition of wrongdoing than in the original bill. The
Copyright Office's draft has sparked new criticism, however, based on
requirements that ISPs and technology companies must take all
"reasonably available corrective measures" and cannot "actively
interfere" with efforts to locate copyright violators. Sarah Deutsch,
vice president and associate general counsel of Verizon Communications,
noted that the language in the draft is vague and could make an ISP
liable, for example, if it refused to provide copyright holders with a
list of the company's subscribers.

More Headline News Avoided By Most Of The Major U.S. Media

HALLIBURTON OUT OF IRAQ?

Various reports are surfacing from both government and
private sources that Halliburton, Vice-President Cheney's
previous employer, will not renew its Iraq contracts.

Multiple sources indicate that the US Army will terminate
Halliburton's no-bid 9-figure contract, of which some $1.2
billion seems to be unaccounted for, and will finally put
these services up for competitive bidding.

Halliburton is reportedly not even going to prepare a bid,
as the new contracts won't be nearly as profitable, since
they now require the usual bidding system.

Researchers on this story say that even if the bidding is
about the same as what the previous contractors received,
it will still save significant amounts of tax revenues,
since Halliburton doesn't really do the work, but rather
takes a few percent off the top and then sub-contracts
the work to others.


ILLINOIS GOVERNOR LOSES TO BUSH ON CANADIAN PHARMACIES

Interestingly enough, I never heard a word about this
in the Illinois media, though I am sure something has
appeared about this.

Illinois governor Rod Blagoijovich's program to allow
citizens to legally fill prescriptions from Canadian
pharmacies was apparently defeated last week.

I only found out about this because a friend needed
some money to fill a prescription that had apparently
just jumped $65 as a result of lost price competition.



*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK


US LIBRARIES LOSING GROUND?


Early indicators point to a drop in library books checked out.

In several interviews around the country, data is emerging to
show that for the first time in history the number of books
checked out from the average US library has actually dropped
over the last couple years.


1 BILLION CELL PHONE SALES IN 18 MONTHS

If industry analysts are correct, the 18 months surrounding
today, 9 months past and 9 months future, will see nearly a
billion cell phones sold worldwide in just a year and a half.

meanwhile:

1/8 BILLION iTUNES SALES

Apple announced that it has sold 125 million iTunes at $.99.


SIMPLE SOLUTION OF THE WEEK

It would appear that the officials at the Republican National
Convention finally figured out how to keep demonstrators from
sneaking into the convention with unapproved signs or comments:

Across the street they have created a Checkpoint Charlie system,
in which delegates, press, etc., are screened, and then wrapped
in orange plastic fencing before being ushered across the street
into Madison Square Garden inside the orange packaging material.

[However, it would appear this didn't work too well, not only
annoying the authorized personnel, but still not keeping out
various groups that wanted platform changes.]


*ODD QUOTATION OF THE WEEK

they will be conquered by uncivilized men who can."
