.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

  http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the world,
and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on the search
results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest
to you, visit:

  http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

EBooks numbered 1 to 10000 are located in "release year" directories.
Over time, the "release year" advanced, so that by November 2003 the
release year was 2006.  Starting with eBook #10001, they are filed by
their official eBook number, with a unique subdirectory based on that
eBook number.

FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000

To get to a directory listing you can use either:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/

Then navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the
appropriate level, and then select the file you wish to download,
using your usual download procedures.  This system works on mirrors,
too, and will hold all eBooks starting with the number "1" for
10,000 and beyond.


FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000:

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download site
(or a mirror) if you know the filename and year you want.  For example,
navigate to either:

  http://gutenberg.net/etext06/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/

and then look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that
updated eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99,
etext00, etc.)

CONVERTING OLD EBOOKS TO THE NEW FILENAMING AND DIRECTORY SYSTEM:

As of 18 May 04, Project Gutenberg volunteers began the process of
manually transferring the eBooks with numbers between 1 and 10000 to
the new directory structure; this means that the files which were
previously posted in etext dirs based on their "official release year"
are now being posted in directories based on their filename.  For example,
eBook #1220, previously posted in the /etext98/ directory, will now be
found in /1/2/2/1220/.  This process will be very slow since it will
include, where possible and practicable, repairing, correcting, and
re-formatting to current PG standards.  The pointers on the PG search
page will be updated as changes are made.

It should be noted that HTML files, particularly those with illustrations,
can now be viewed online directly.

During the past week we processed the following ebooks per the above:

=============================================================================

"For those wishing to know. . .":  David Price sends along the following
notes and comments about a couple of this week's postings:

About #12510, "Targum", (Subtitled "Metrical Translations from Thirty
Languages and Dialects"), by George Borrow:

For those wishing to know: English eccentric George Borrow produced this
book in 1835, whilst in St. Petersburg for the Bible Society.  George
was a self-taught "linguist" - at this stage he'd learnt Manchu (Chinese)
in order to superindent the printing of the Bible in that language.  As you
can see by the title George was also relatively fluent in 30 languages by
this stage - from Rommany (Gypsy) through Polish and Finnish through to
Latin, French and Anglo Saxon - and many more.

This is a fairly rare book - in any form, and so it's a good addition to
the collection.  I know the George Borrow Society are keen to see his
rare works such as this available to a wide audience.

. . .

re: #844, "The Importance of Being Earnest"by Oscar Wilde:

For those wishing to know: Probably Oscar's most famous play where Algernon
and Jack, together with the lovely Cecily and Gwendolen, ably assisted by
the memorable Lady Blacknell - find out why it's important to be Earnest.
They are assisted by various other characters - including a hand-bag.

. . .

#12561, "A Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy," by Ida Pfeiffer

For those wishing to know: Ida Pfeiffer was a very inoffensive lady who,
after living a quiet life and raising a family, finally got the chance to
travel - her secret life-long ambition.  She wasn't rich and women travellers
were frowned up in her time.  In this book she tells of her first trip - to the
Holy Land.  Her relations were unable to frown upon the trip - it was pratically
religious.  With the money she made from sales of this book she was then able to
pay for a trip to Iceland (see A Visit to Iceland - in Project Gutenberg) and
other trips followed.  Her world trip is also available in Project Gutenberg: A
Woman's Journey Round the World.
