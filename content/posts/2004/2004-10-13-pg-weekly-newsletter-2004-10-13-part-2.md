.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

TOTAL COUNT as of today, Wed  13 Oct 2004:  14,077 (incl. 382 Aus.).

Last week the Total Count was 13,948, including 380 at PG of Australia.
This week we added 130 new, including 2 at PG of Australia.  However, as
indicated below, one eBook previously posted (#13661) was withdrawn, and
that eBook number was re-used for a new posting, also as indicated; so
the total count is only increased by 129.

RESERVED/PENDING count:   43 (No change this week).

=============================================================================

David Price, reporting from England, about #13672, The Unknown Eros, by
Coventry Patmore:

This eText was produced by UK volunteer Les Bowler.  For those wishing to
know: it's poetry and Coventry Patmore was a man.  Les reports that he found
the poems hard to follow.  We've done a few other poetry books by Patmore,
although most of the litrary criticism seems to say that this one is his
masterpiece.

~ ~ ~

David signed his message:  "England, windy and cold".  Does anyone else find
this a bit redundant? &lt;vbg&gt;

~ ~ ~

A dream is just a dream. A goal is a dream with a plan and a deadline.
