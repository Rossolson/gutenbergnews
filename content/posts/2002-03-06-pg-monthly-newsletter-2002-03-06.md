- Requests For Assistance From Our Volunteers

Mirror integrity checking:  We are working to make sure
all mirrors listed at our Web site are consistently available
and up to date.  (See http://promo.net/pg/list.html for the
current list of mirrors.)

If you run a mirror and are removed from the list, please
get in touch with admin@promo.net.

We are always seeking new mirrors!!  Because we have recently
removed some broken and unavailable mirrors from our list,
we find we have very poor availability in some parts of the
world, including Latin America, Africa and Asia.  A mirror requires
about 8GB of disk space, and reasonable network connectivity.

Mirrors that only serve a particular region are also welcome.

For information about mirroring, email gbnewby@ils.unc.edu

DONATIONS TO PROJECT GUTENBERG

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of
volunteers over more than 30 years.  Your donations make it possible
to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the
creation of free electronic texts.  We accept credit cards, checks and
money transfers from any country, in any currency.

Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF), a corporation registered in the US State of
Mississippi.  PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization
by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee
Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

More information about PGLAF is available, including several different
methods of donating.  Please visit http://promo.net/pg/fundraising, or
email the PGLAF's chief executive officer (and volunteer), Dr. Gregory
B. Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;

- Access To The Collection

For a list of mirrors (copies) of the Project Gutenberg
collection, view http://promo.net/pg/list.html

We're always looking for new mirrors, especially outside
North America.  For information about how to set one up,
contact Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;

***

- Information About Mirror Sites

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Choose a mirror of the Project
Gutenberg collection near you.

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

&lt;http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;
or
&lt;ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03&gt;

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.

Note that updated etexts usually go in the original directory of
their assigned year of publication  (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

***

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 03/06/02**:  4,712
(This number includes the 51 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

In the first 9 weeks of this year, we have produced 420 new eBooks!!!
Note: it took us from 1971 to 1996 to produce our *FIRST* 420 eBooks!

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week ending on a Wednesday, starting
with the first Wednesday in Jan.  In 2002, Jan 2nd was the first
Wednesday, and Jan 9th was the end of the first week of production.

With 4,712 eTexts online as of March 6, it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.12 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $3.10 when we had 3227 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine thousands of books each costing $.98 less a year later?

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!
