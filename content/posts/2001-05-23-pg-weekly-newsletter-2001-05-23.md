*The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter for Wednesday, May 23, 2001*

June 6th and July 4th will be the last times both Newsletters go out
from the same listserver, more details on this as time goes on. . .

[Given the votes being split very evenly between weekly and monthly,
we are going to endeavor to present this Newsletter in both formats.
We will try to set up two listservers by our 30th Anniversary on the
4th of July, and you will get both versions until/unless you send an
unsubscribe message to the one you do not want to receive.  A larger
majority voted for both than for either just weekly or monthly.]

[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

Requests For Assistance

We are forming a team to create Etexts in Japanese, please let me know
if you are interested, and please   cc:  Rick Davis &lt;rdavis@yin.or.jp&gt;

***

Our recent release of Etext #3333 in Portuguese has inspired the forming
of a Project Gutenberg Portuguese Team which has applied for gutenberg.pt
as a domain name.  If you are interested in being a founding member of
this team, please let me know.

Volunteers Needed: An offline distributed proofing/editing site has finally
reached version 1.0. We would like to have any volunteers that are not
currently assigned/busy to visit the site and see if any of our materials
are of interest. This site is designed specifically for people who would
like participate on their own computer and not be connected to the internet,
i.e. only a single modem line, pay for access (AOL or outside of the US) by
the minute, while traveling, etc. A volunteer requests a chapter of one of
our books via email, and the chapter is sent via return email. The chapter
is proofed and submitted back via email. We are trying to keep the
technology to a bare minimum, email address and text editor. The new web
address is http://www.metalbox.net/dcushman/pgroot.htm. If anyone has
questions, please let me know dcushman@texas.net.  Dewayne Cushman

The work on the Richard Burton Arabian Nights is nearing completion.
That means that I am getting ready to begin work on the John Payne
translation of Arabian Nights and the Jonathan Scott translation.
Additionally, there are still a few stories left to do from the Burton
translation and I am presently scanning a couple of Burton's other
books.  I'm looking for people who might be interested in working on a
tale from Arabian Nights (or perhaps a fairy tale from one Andrew Lang's
colour books). Please feel free to contact me at
jcbyers@capitalnet.com.  To see a list of Arabian Nights tales currently
available go to http://www.capitalnet.com/~jcbyers/available-tales.htm

GILT is a program to allow for the easy browsing of Project Gutenberg's
index file and the perusal of available etexts. It presents a list of
selectable titles and allows these to be downloaded with a single click.
Both the index and etexts can be downloaded over HTTP or FTP from a number
of Gutenberg mirror sites, through authenticating proxies if required.
Multiple etexts can be fetched simultaneously.

GILT is a Java application, using the Swing libraries to provide a
graphical user interface. It requires the Java 2 platform to run, i.e. a
Java development kit or runtime environment with a version number of 1.2
or greater. Tested platforms include MacOS X, GNU / Linux, and Solaris.
Versions of Java less than 1.2 are untested, and would require the Swing
extensions to be installed.

GILT is still in development. If you have a feature you would like to see
added, or wish to report a bug, please contact george.russell@strath.ac.uk
with details, and I'll see what can be done. Its also nice to receive
success stories, so if you get GILT running correctly I'd like to hear
about it. The homepage for GILT is http://dogma.freebsd-

Comments About Our Improved Files

So far our German Team has been the most prolific of all our various
teams in other languages, but I should remind you that it took great
effort and a number of tries to get the German Team working and that
we will continue our efforts to include more and more languages.

IBM BREAKS DISK DENSITY BARRIER
IBM disk technology researchers have broken what had been regarded as a
fundamental limit in disk density, and the company's Travelstar product
line of notebook hard disks can now be produced with densities up 25.7
billion bits a square inch; by 2003 IBM will be able to achieve disk
density on the Travelstar line to 100 billion bits per square inch. With
disk drive density doubling every 12 months, the technology is advancing
even faster than the rate of Gordon Moore's celebrated "Moore's Law," which
predicted a doubling of transistor density (and computer power) every 18
months.(New York Times 21 May 2001)

EUROPE: POLICE WANT TO MONITOR ALL NET TRAFFIC
The European Home Office has proposed that ISPs and other network
operators retain data on telecommunications usage, such as
records of e-mail and Internet use, for seven years. The proposal
would grant the police much greater power to intercept and study
data communications. However, the proposal is meeting with stiff
opposition from numerous groups across Europe. Opponents charge
that the proposal places an undue responsibility on ISPs and
other telecom companies. Moreover, opponents say the proposal
challenges the privacy of citizens. "Europe has been at the
forefront of protecting individual privacy--it would be tragic to
turn it into a law enforcement directive," said David Banisar,
deputy director of Privacy International. The United Kingdom's
e-minister Patricia Hewitt has also voiced opposition to the
proposal. To be implemented, the proposal must have the approval
of both he European Council of Ministers and the full European
Parliament.  (ZDNet, 17 May 2001)

NEW STUDY REPEATS ANTI-PRIVACY LEGISLATION MANTRA
Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) has released a report
criticizing Congressional efforts to legislate privacy as an
unnecessary task better left to the private sector. "Federal
privacy regulations or legislation are unnecessary and...the
private sector is more effective than government in this
increasingly important area," concluded the report, "Keeping
Big Brother From Watching You." Noting that the 107th Congress
has already introduced 40 privacy bills, CAGW president Thomas
A. Schatz blasted the federal government for its "technological
ineptitude" and inability to protect the personal data it
collects from its own citizens. The CAGW report includes
examples of what CAGW considers good, industry-led initiatives
to safeguard online privacy.  (Newsbytes, 16 May 2001)

SOFTWARE TO HELP PROTECT SURFERS
The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) software, which
instantly judges Web site privacy policies so consumers can make
strict choices about privacy levels, will be hitting the market
bundled with Microsoft products this summer. Microsoft will ship
a limited P3P program embedded in its new Web browser. P3P
software itself is already available from various vendors.
Various Web sites, including those of the U.S. Office of National
Drug Control Policy, Hewlett-Packard, America Online, and
Microsoft, have incorporated P3P grading, which warns P3P-enabled
consumers if sites fall below pre-programmed acceptable levels.
Of course, it is likely that the vast majority of Web sites have
not incorporated this mechanism. The World Wide Web Consortium,
which has worked on P3P since 1997, says it will release its P3P
version within six months and will pressure the world's 100 top
Web sites to adopt P3P, building momentum for large-scale adoption.

SUNY ONLINE EDUCATION ENROLLMENT DOUBLES
Second only to the University of Maryland in its number of online
students, the State University of New York (SUNY) Learning
Network boasts an array of more than 2,000 Internet-delivered
courses for the fall. Last year, 25,814 students were enrolled
in the classes, bankrolled by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and
SUNY. Students pay $3,400 per year for the online classes, the
same as a SUNY campus student minus campus fees. Students can
also enroll through community and other colleges, often at
lower prices. The Learning Network program began in 1995 and
links learners to teachers at 53 educational institutions that
combined will offer over 2,000 courses by this fall.

EUROPE GAINING GROUND ON INTERNET DOMINANCE
European Internet growth is still steadily on the rise at the same time
that growth in the U.S. online population seems to have leveled off,
according to international research firm Ipsos-Reid. "Though the U.S. still
by far has the largest single user base, non-Americans now outnumber
Americans on the Internet by a clear margin," says the report. "Europe is
poised to become the leader of the next Internet generation. With southern
Europe finally catching up with Northern Europe in terms of Internet usage
and Europe's greater acceptance of wireless applications, you have a
potential Internet market that promises to be as, if not more important
than America's." The U.S. share of global users shrank from 40% to 36% over
the last year, and will continue to drop as the Internet grows far faster
in other parts of the world. (InternetWeek 16 May 2001)

GATEWAY AND JUNO TO STOP PROMISING "FREE" INTERNET ACCESS
Gateway and Juno Online Services have agreed with a Federal Trade
Commission demand that the two companies make it clearer to customers and
prospective customers that their offers of "free" Internet connections
actually are not free at all. An FTC official said: "These so-called free
Internet access offers were anything but. Information about fees was hidden
in the fine print. The relevant conditions of any offer should be disclosed
clearly and conspicuously so that consumers can make their purchases based
on the facts." (Washington Post 15 May 2001)

FREE INTERNET PROVIDERS AGREE TO CLARIFY, REFUND CHARGES
Pressured by the FTC, Juno Online Services and Gateway have
agreed to refund fees incurred in supposedly "free" Internet
access deals. Both companies failed to disclose hidden costs for
some of their customers, such as the $3.95 per hour rural
surcharge residents had to pay to hook up to theGateway.net
service. Juno was accused of misleading customers and making it
hard for them to pull out of free trial agreements. Recently,
the FTC has been seen as getting tough with tech firms that
use gimmicky marketing techniques or questionable advertising.
Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, for example, were forced to
compensate consumers after they advertised their Pocket PC PDA
product as being Internet-enabled without informing customers
that additional equipment needed to be purchased for the devices
to work that way.  (Washington Post, 16 May 2001)
