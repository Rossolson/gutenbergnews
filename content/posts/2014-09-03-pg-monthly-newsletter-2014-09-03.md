* TPP: Getting involved

Have you heard of the Trans-Pacific Partnership?  Most people haven't.
Yet, this is one of the most important international treaties that may
have a large impact on your life, in the near future.

Among other things, the TPP will serve to again halt progression of
the Public Domain, by locking up copyrighted works for another
extended period.  In the 20th century in the United States, copyright
terms were extended an astounding 14 times.  At Project Gutenberg, we
knew there would be another extension planned before the current one
reaches its 20th anniversary in 2018, and the TPP is it.

Rather than just addressing the United States, the TPP will be,
effectively, worldwide.  The unduly long copyright terms of the US
will become even longer, and copyright terms elsewhere in the world
will be extended in the interest of global "regularization."

Please learn more, and consider signing up at "Our Fair Deal," along
with Project Gutenberg, The Electronic Frontier Foundation, The
Internet Archive, and Public Knowledge.

* Our first eBook in Farsi

Our first eBook in the Farsi language is now available:

  Five Selected Short Stories, by D.H. Lawrence
  www.gutenberg.org/etext/46740

We are grateful to Siaavash Malekei for donating this translation
to the public domain, and making it available to Project Gutenberg.


* CD/DVD ISO maker and MARC records

As mentioned in our previous newsletter, the custom CD/DVD ISO maker
is now back online.  This is a way to make your own collection of
Project Gutenberg items, suitable for copying to your computer and
sharing with others.  You can select the format (such as HTML or
epub), language, and specific eBooks you want.

Visit http://pgiso.pglaf.org to get started.  This service is mainly
directed at people who have good network bandwidth, and are
comfortable working with relatively large files with complex formats.


* Trouble for Amazon Kindle users

A service change in how Amazon provides Internet access to Kindle
users has left some users blocked due to Project Gutenberg's inability
to service anonymous and automated requests.  We apologize that there
is not a lot we can do to fix this, other than to recommend
alternate devices, alternate methods to connect to www.gutenberg.org,
and the use of our mirrors.

See our "mobile reader how-to" for more information.  Alternate
download destinations are listed on eBook "Download" pages.


* Roboting/harvesting advice

Please see our robot guidelines at www.gutenberg.org if you would
like to download large quantities of material from Project Gutenberg.

There are many ways of doing this that don't trigger our anti-robot
mechanism.  One is the ISO maker mentioned above.  Another is to use
rsync.  Still another is to use one of our mirror sites.  Send us an
email (see our "Contact Us" link) if you want to access a large number
of eBooks, and are having trouble.


* Thank you for your donations!

In 2014 so far, we have received over 2700 donations, from 45
countries.  Many of these donations are just $1!  We use these
donations to support our many volunteers, and keep our systems
running.  To learn more, visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
