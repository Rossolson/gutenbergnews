As of May 21, 2008: "Original Project Gutenberg eBook" site totals have reached 28,000, details below.

Please do not forget the 1600+ from PG of Australia, the ~500 from PG Europe, and the ~100 from PG Canada, with a detailed list included below. Not to mention the sites: [Gutenberg.cc](http://www.gutenberg.cc) with 75,000+ eBooks, and Project Runeberg with eBooks in the Scandinavian languages.

Please note: the figures presented here are usually the more conservative figures people have presented, but the date of our eBook #25,000 was said to have been slightly earlier than reported. Personally, I would prefer to be a little cautious about reporting the numbers of eBooks, but if anyone would like to help us with the accounting, that would be GRRRREAT!!!
