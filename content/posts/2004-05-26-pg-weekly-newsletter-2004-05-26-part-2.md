.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

  http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the world,
and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on the search
results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest
to you, visit:

  http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

EBooks numbered 1 to 10000 are located in "release year" directories.
Over time, the "release year" advanced, so that by November 2003 the
release year was 2006.  Starting with eBook #10001, they are filed by
their official eBook number, with a unique subdirectory based on that
eBook number.

FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000

To get to a directory listing you can use either:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/

Then navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the
appropriate level, and then select the file you wish to download,
using your usual download procedures.  This system works on mirrors,
too, and will hold all eBooks starting with the number "1" for
10,000 and beyond.


FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000:

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download site
(or a mirror) if you know the filename and year you want.  For example,
navigate to either:

  http://gutenberg.net/etext06/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/

and then look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that
updated eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99,
etext00, etc.)

CONVERTING OLD EBOOKS TO THE NEW FILENAMING AND DIRECTORY SYSTEM:

As of 18 May 04, Project Gutenberg volunteers began the process of
manually transferring the eBooks with numbers between 1 and 10000 to the
new directory structure.  This means that the files which were
previously posted in etext dirs based on their "official release year"
are now being posted in directories based on their filename.

This process includes, where possible and practicable, repairing,
correcting, and re-formatting to current PG standards, and in the
beginning stages will be very slow.  Place-holder files are being inserted
in the original file locations, directing user's to the new location.  The
pointers on the PG search page are being updated as changes are made.

It should be noted that one of the primary benefits of the new file
system is that HTML files, especially illustrated HTML files, can now be
viewed directly online rather than having to be downloaded.

During the past week we processed the following ebooks per the above:
