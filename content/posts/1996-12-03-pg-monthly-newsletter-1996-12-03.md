This is probabaly the last Newsletter that is going to the OLD server; at
gutnberg@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu
. . .if you want to delete yourself . . .
there is probably no need, but you should ask me about listproc@ prairienet.org
if you haven't changes your subscription.

Well, my link to uiarchive is finally back up, so the November Etexts should
be on all our major sites, as below, by the time you see this. I am not sure
when the international sites do their mirroring but the US sites should all
be ready to go.

My apologies, many of our links, drive, and computers have been down, all
week long.

My apologies, also, for the fact that the CBC told me my interview would
be on the air on Thanksgiving [Canadien OR American]. . .but they JUST called
and told me it would be on the CBC and PRI tonite at 7:00 PM. . .we get PRI
on PBS. . .Tuesday. . .December 3, 1996.

[Canadian Broadcasting Company/Corporation]
[Public Radio International]
[Public Broadcasting Service/System]

We shall see/hear.

Wired also called today, they now say we are in the February Wired which
should go on the stands in early January. Around page 90.

In response to last month's Newsletter, we have received a moderate amount
of good wishes, and offers of several more computer sites on which to post
these Project Gutenberg Etexts, and hopefully enough legal support to get
us into a "Project Gutenberg, Inc." phase of existence, something I definintely
have an approach/avoidance thing about.

However, it seems that getting any actual financial assistance to keep a
roof over the head of this particular computer, and its cousins, along with
myself . . .might be on the order of having a snowball fight in the nether
regions.

We received about enough money to keep us running for a week.

Please put us on your Holiday gift list. . .information appended.

If you have ANY hope of contacting ANYone at ANY institution that could be
an eventual financial supporter, please let us know. The roof is paid for,
this would only pay for the power, phone, taxes and other utilities.

Once again we have managed to present 32 files we hope will be of interest
to the general population. We have two more months scheduled for 32 per month--
then we hope to once again double our production, this time to 64 per month--
for each of the 12 months of 1997.

While this may appear as an incredible amount of work, the truth is that
your volunteers at Project Gutenberg have already spend several months doing
books at the rate of 64 per month, during the Spring of 1996 just to insure
that in 1997 we would be capable of accomplishing our goals.

However, Etexts and copyright clearances are only barely coming in for the
32 Etexts per month scheduled for 1996, and usually we would be posting the
ones for December right now, rather than for November, so unless we manage
more of getting volunteers, or increasing their efficiency, we might have
to send out only 32 books per month in 1997. . .maybe change our name to
"The Book Of The Day Project."
