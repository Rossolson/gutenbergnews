***The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, June 21, 2006 PT1***
*******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971********

    A Special Abbreviated Edition of The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter
             This combines portions of Part 1a and Part 1b

     [You might want to keep this one for reference, as it explains a number
        of questions frequently raised about how Project Gutenberg works.]


EXTRA!!!   EXTRA!!!   EXTRA!!!    EXTRA!!!    EXTRA!!!    EXTRA!!!    EXTRA!!!



     On Midsummer's Day, 2006, the number of eBooks originated by and for
                     Project Gutenberg reached 20,000


   As we approach the 35th anniversary of the start of Project Gutenberg,
               a number of milestones are being passed.

           Project Gutenberg of Australia Passes 700 eBooks!

            Project Gutenberg of Europe Passes 300 eBooks!

             Distributed Proofreaders Passes 8,600 eBooks!



                          *eBook Milestones*

           20,000 eBooks As Of Today At These Four PG Sites


           20,000 Project Gutenberg  [+111] Grand Total [Automated]
              710 Australian eBooks   [+42] [Included in above line]
              318 Gutenberg Europe     [+0] [Including after July 4]
              368 PG   PrePrint Site [  +0] [Included in above total]
              109 Total New Books This Week
           19,995 Grand Total of all four sites [Four more since then]
           20,000 [via our automated program]
                  [Please note we have several counting methods,
                  and they often differ by several book that we
                  have to hunt down by hand to reconcile.]

These figures as of 6:21 PM CDT, we have had several more entries since.


      ***572 eBooks Averaged Per Year Since July 4, 1971***

             16,832 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~262 eBooks per Month for ~64.50 Months

            1,852 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

            40 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
             8,611 total from Distributed Proofreaders
              Since October, 2000 [Details in PT1B]
              [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]

          We Are Averaging ~336 eBooks Per Month This Year
                [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 77 eBooks Per Week In 2006


It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our 1st 10,000 eBooks

It took ~32 months, from 2003 to 2006 for our last 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to ~20,000


[The above changes due to the opening of Project Gutenberg
sites other than the original one at www.gutenberg.org]
[Now including totals from Australia, Europe and PrePrints]
[Apologies, it will take a while to integrate everything
not all statistics may be totally equalized yet]
[Daily PGEu stats at http://dp.rastko.net/default.php]
[Daily DP stats at http://www.pgdp.net]

BTW, we just started a new "PrePrints" site at PG,
so if you come across eBooks that aren't ready for
primetime, but that should be saved for upgrading,
we have a place to put them.

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

*

75,000+ eBooks at the PG Consortia Center
http://www.gutenberg.cc
[Including after July 4]

The major difference between the eBooks at the PG Consortia Center
and those at the originating PG sites is that the eBooks available
at the Consortia Center were created by and for other eLibraries--
while the eBooks at the originating Project Gutenberg sites are in
the vast majority created specifically by Project Gutenberg.  ~100
eLibraries should be listed at the Consortia Center by July 4, and
we are hoping for ~200 by next year.  These eBooks are created for
other projects, with other standards, and we do not change them or
make corrections without the originating eLibrary's permission.

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~34,286 Unique eBooks

The new overall collection size, which has reduced the
need to account for duplications and eBooks with files
for each chapter, etc.
                                  75,000+ Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 25,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,700 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Statistical Review

FLASHBACK!

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet?

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,523,584,700 that would be 20,000 x 65,235,847 = ~1.30 Trillion !!!

With 20,000 eBooks online as of June 21, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.77 from each book.
[1% world population x #eBooks] 65,235,847 x 20,000 x $.77 = ~$1 Trillion
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]
[By the way, the US "popclock" is about to turn to 300 million people.]
[Just turned 299 million this week!]

*


A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.50 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 20,000 eBooks online as of June 21, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.50 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.61 when we had 16,518 eBooks a year ago.

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100,000,000 people.


At 20,000 eBooks in 34 Years and 11.50 Months We Averaged
       572 Per Year
        48 Per Month
         1.57 Per Day

At 1850 eBooks Done In The 168 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
    11.0 Per Day
      77 per Week
     334 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 298M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 1/6 the way to 299M, so
it will probably be 10 more weeks to 299M and 22 more to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

*

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.
