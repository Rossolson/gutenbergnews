FEATURED NEWS

PROJECT RUNEBERG: PROOFREADING ACTIVITY GRAPHS

Since you seldom hear anything from Project Runeberg, you might have concluded
that we're dead now.  But this is wrong.  Even though less books are added,
we still have people actively proofreading the pages we scanned before.
Compared to PGDP.net, our system is more wiki-like (less workflow oriented)
and our volunteer proofreaders can jump to any page they like, resulting in
fewer completed books.

Just like a wiki, we have a page listing the recent changes,
http://runeberg.org/rc.pl

This page is generated by a little Perl script, that reads a log file, where
our proofreading script adds a line each time a page is proofread. Other
scripts (upload, metadata updates, etc.) also write their changes to the same
log.

Since our webserver runs Debian Linux, it was very easy to install "Munin", a
free software for system performance diagrams.  And it was also easy to write
a Munin plugin that reads our recent changes log file, displaying the number
of edits per hour, each category of changes having its own color,
http://runeberg.org/admin/munin/runeberg/fatabur.runeberg-runeberg_proofreading.html

As you can see, we average 4 whole pages per hour over the last week, and 3
minor edits per hour.  This week also seem to have 0.1 new works (scanned and)
uploaded per hour, which isn't too bad.

Between midnight and 6 AM (local Swedish time) there is almost no activity.

The traditional Munin graphs display the performance and usage of our server's
components: processor, RAM, disk, network bandwidth,
http://runeberg.org/admin/munin/runeberg/fatabur.runeberg.html

Old UNIX sysadmins will recognize Munin as an "MRTG" replacement.
More information about Munin is found here, http://munin.projects.linpro.no/

PGDP.net of course has it's own system for graphs, showing activity per user
and team.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
