So here they are, after...err, several months, the final results from the '_How many e-texts have you read from the PG archives?_' Poll. Even after all this time there are still only 50 votes cast. Top of the list is 200+ e-text read from the PG archives but the big surprise for me is that the 50-100 e-texts does not come in at a higher position.

Thanks to everyone who participated and...keep on reading.
