<img src="/images/speak-the-speech-logo.jpg" title="Speak The Speech Logo" alt="Speak The Speech Logo" align="right" />In response to our [Shakespeare Actors Wanted](https://www.gutenbergnews.org/20070902/shakespearean-actors-wanted/ "Shakespeare Actors Wanted") request, where we are looking for volunteers actors to read the plays of Shakespeare, I had an email from a Peter Pressman who wrote to me about the <a href="http://www.speak-the-speech.com/" title="Speak The Speak Official Website" target="_blank">Speak The Speech</a> project. This is a group of volunteers who are wanting to make Shakespeare more universally accessible by producing audio recordings of all his plays.

> We are a small audio theatre company dedicated to providing freely available Shakespearean audio performances online, for the benefit of educators, students, theatre people, the disabled, those in rural areas or overseas, or to put it simply: Everyone!

They have so far produced five full plays with their sixth, Romeo and Juliet, currently in production.

  * **As You Like It**
  * **Henry IV: Part I**
  * **Henry IV: Part II**
  * **Romeo and Juliet (Coming Soon!)**
  * **Twelfth Night**
  * **The Tempest**

Peter hopes that they can work together with <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" title="Project Gutenberg homepage" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a> towards providing the complete works of William Shakespeare online for free. I hope so too and have placed Peter in contact with Michael Hart.

Speak The Speech are always seeking submissions, and volunteers so if you want to help, or just wish to listen to their current selections, please visit; <a href="http://www.speak-the-speech.com" title="Speak The Speak Official Website" target="_blank">www.speak-the-speech.com</a>
