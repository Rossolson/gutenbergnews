Here's an article found over at <a href="http://www.teleread.org/blog/?p=7177" target="_blank">TeleRead</a> that should be of great interest to Project Gutenberg.

> Sixteen million copyright records from the [U.S. Copyright Office](http://www.copyright.gov/) are now [available in bulk](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/09/making_a_brouha.html), thanks to the [efforts](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/09/carl_malamud_ta_1.html) of [Carl Malamud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud) (left), [Peter Brantley](http://radar.oreilly.com/peter/) and others.
> No more will the feds [charge tens of thousands of dollars](http://www.teleread.org/blog/?p=7135) for subscriptions to the copyright catalog of of monographs, documents, and serials. Way to go, guys! Nothing like [“a bit of a blogospheric brouhaha”](http://www.loc.gov/blog/?p=187) to stir things up, eh? Now, here’s the fun part. The government had attracted only two subscribers, given the outrageous fees.

Having access to such a database should help anyone wanting to research the suitability of books for inclusion in the PG archives.
