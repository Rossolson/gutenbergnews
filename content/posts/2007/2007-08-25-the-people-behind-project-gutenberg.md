<img title="Project Gutenberg Logo" src="/images/gutenberg.jpg" alt="Project Gutenberg Logo" align="right" />There's no doubt PG would not be where it is today without Michael Hart and the tens of thousands of volunteers from around the world. As you can imagine, it's impossible to name every person. What Wiki Team member <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/User:Ricdiogo" target="new">Ricardo F. Diogo</a> has done is put together a page on the Gutenberg Wiki naming the people heading up the core parts of [gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org).

If you don't already know who is;

  * Founder and Executive Coordinator
  * CEO of the PGLAF
  * Production Directors (Aus, NZ, UK, US)
  * Webmaster
  * Newsletter Editor
  * Posting Team
  * Cataloguing Team
  * Wiki Team

Then go take a look at [The People Behind Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/The_People_Behind_Project_Gutenberg) Wiki page.

[UPDATE] _This Wiki page is not yet complete so if there are any additions you think should be on there, then please email Ricardo (his email is on the Wiki page)_
