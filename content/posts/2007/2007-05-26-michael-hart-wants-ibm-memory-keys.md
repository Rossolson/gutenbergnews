Michael Hart is looking for one of the original "IBM Memory Keys" that have evolved into our current RAMsticks, USBsticks, etc., or even the UK version that existed before that. It doesn't have to be functional...he just wants it for comparison purposes. Please contact Michael at hart@pglaf.org if you might be able to provide one.
