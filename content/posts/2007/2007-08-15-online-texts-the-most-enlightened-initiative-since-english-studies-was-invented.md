<q>Thousands of literary texts are now available online, all submitted by volunteers. Is this the most enlightened initiative since English studies was invented?</q> John Sutherland wrote an interesting article for the Gardian Unlimited back in July.

In this article he make mention of Project Gutenberg along with several other online projects.

Here's a short extract to wet your tastbuds;

> This summer, I suspect, a student will graduate from a good university with an excellent degree in English. No rarity there. The degrees get better every year. Too good, some cynics say.
>
> But this student, as he/she takes his/her scroll and smiles for the parental video, will be a new kind of academic animal: one on whom the antique gown, mortar board, and vellum sit awkwardly.
>
> She/he will never – in their three years of undergraduate study – have worked in a library, or bought a book from a walk-in bookshop.
>
> There may only be one, or a handful, of such graduates this year. In 10 years time it's the other kind that will be the rarity.
