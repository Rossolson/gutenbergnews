<a href="http://www.firstbook.org" target="_blank">First Book</a> is a site that aims to help literacy by giving children from low-income families the opportunity to read and own their first books.

This week <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6471881.html?nid=2286&source=title&rid=257945418" target="_blank">Publishers Weekly</a> reported on this very generous donation from Random House.

> Flexing its philanthropic muscle, Random House is making a multiyear $1-million donation to First Book, the national nonprofit that supports literacy efforts. The donation, which is the most significant philanthropic contribution the company has made to date, grew out of a longstanding relationship the house has with First Book; the Random House Childrenâ€™s division was a charter member of the organization and has been working with it for the past decade.

Michael Hart is an advocate of increasing literacy in the young. With the help of First Book and donations like this, perhaps we are another step closer to achieving this goal.
