<img src="/images/tei-banner.jpg" title="TEI <Text Encoding Initiative> Banner" alt="TEI <Text Encoding Initiative> Banner" align="texttop" />So it is finally here, **TEI v1.0 of P5**. Around six months ago I did some research into TEI and noted there was some big improvements over P4. If you need a mature XML based markup (perhaps for use as a [Master File Format](https://www.gutenbergnews.org/20070214/digital-text-masters-a-future-for-public-domain-ebooks/ "Digital Text Masters")) I would certainly recommend having look at TEI P5.

Here is the official notification of the release;

> After more than 6 years of, at times quite intensive, development, it is with great pleasure that I announce the release of version 1.0 of P5, the latest and greatest version of the Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative, which officially happened Nov. 2 at the TEI Members Meeting in Maryland. You will find the new version online at <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html" title="TEI Official Website" target="_blank">www.tei-c.org</a>; a PDF and even printed books are expected to appear in due time.
>
> The main development work has been carried out by the TEI Technical Council and the Editors Lou Burnard and Syd Bauman. I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank all previous members of the Council but also especially the current members, who shared quite a big of the work, which magically increased as the release date was approaching:
>
> David Birnbaum, Tone Merete Bruvik, Arianna Ciula, James Cummings, Matthew Driscoll, Daniel O'Donnel, Dot Porter, Sebastian Rahtz Laurent Romary, Conal Tuohy, John Walsh.
>
> Christian Wittern
> Chair, TEI Technical Council

Recently the PG mailing list has had some active discussions on TEI and it looks like more and more people there are utilising this markup format. I'm sure in the near future we will see an influx of PG texts marked-up in TEI.

_On a side note_: The TEI website has also had a face-lift, which I have to say looks much nicer!

_Thanks to Jon Noring for posting this great piece of news to the PG mailing list._
