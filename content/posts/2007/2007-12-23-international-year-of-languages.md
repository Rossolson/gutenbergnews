> "Acting without a vote, the Assembly, also recognizing that the United Nations pursues multilingualism as a means of promoting, protecting and preserving diversity of languages and cultures globally, emphasized the paramount importance of the equality of the Organization’s six official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish)."

Note the lack of languages from India and Africa, but the inclusion of previous world powers of Spain, France, and Russia, and only one currently rising superpower, China.

This reflects a greater concern with political power than serving the actual general world population, where India, Indonesia, Africa, Pakistan, etc., reflect some one third of the entire world population without their languages in the official representation of the United Nations.

> UN proclaims 2008 as Year of Languages
> Bruxelles – Brussel, Friday, 18 May 2007 by Davyth Hicks
>
> The United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed 2008 the International Year of Languages. It will aim to promote unity through linguistic diversity. The Assembly called upon States and the Secretariat to work towards the conservation and defence of the world's languages and requested the Secretariat to appoint a coordinator for multilingualism.
>
> Representatives from several States made contributions. The Andorran representative said, "Protecting languages is one of the fundamental pillars of cultural diversity".
>
> Meanwhile, there was refreshing news for our Breton, Basque, Occitan and Corsican readers when the representative from France said, “The right to use your own language, the capacity to communicate and, therefore, to understand and be understood, the preservation of an inheritance that dates back centuries or even millennia, should be of prime importance to the United Nations”.

> The United Nations proclaims 2008 International Year of Languages
>
> In the plenary session held on the 16th of May 2007, the General Assembly of the United Nations, recognizing that genuine multilingualism promotes unity in diversity and international understanding, decided to proclaim 2008 the International Year of Languages. In addition, the Assembly made a call to the states and to the Secretariat for them to work in favour conservation and defence of the languages globally, and requested the Secretariat to appoint a coordinator for multilingualism.
>
> The Assembly, also recognizing that the United Nations pursues multilingualism as a means of promoting, protecting and preserving diversity of languages and cultures globally, stated the action would allow to guarantee a “global” approach to multilingualism and would promote a reasonable vision of multilingualism in the United Nations.
>
> In addition, the Assembly indicated that linguistic diversity is the foundation of cultural diversity, and in this sense it hopes, therefore, that the next resolution on multilingualism will include an explicit reference to the need for linguistic diversity in peacekeeping operations.
>
> Besides proclaiming the International Year of Languages, the Assembly asked the Secretary General to ensure that all linguistic services of the United Nations have the same resources, to resist the increasing dominion of English over the other five UN official languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, Spanish and Russian.
>
> The idea to dedicate a whole year to languages arose about two years ago, when, on the occasion of the UNESCO 33rd General Conference, held at the end of 2005 in Paris, Austria proposed the idea, which other states supported.
>
> With this resolution at the highest level, the recognition of linguistic diversity and the importance of their promotion and maintenance turn to international instances.

> The Assembly was informed that any resource implications resulting from the resolution would be addressed in the Secretary-General’s report to the sixty-third session of the Assembly on implementation of the resolution.
>
> Also this afternoon, the Assembly, acting on the recommendation of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), adopted without a vote the resolution entitled “Comprehensive review of a strategy to eliminate future sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping operations” (contained in document A/61/409/Add.1).
>
> By the terms of the text, the Assembly — reaffirming the need to implement a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping operations, and to assist victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by the Organization’s staff or related personnel — would endorse the proposals, recommendations and conclusions contained in the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations at its second resumed session of 2006, held on 18 December.
>
> In that report, the Special Committee requested the open-ended ad hoc working group of experts to continue its consideration of a revised draft model Memorandum of Understanding with troop-contributing countries at a resumed session before the end of June.
>
> The representative of Uganda, underscoring the importance of the issue, said his delegation supported the “zero-tolerance” concept; after all, peacekeepers should not be “peace abusers”. Underlying factors, such as poverty, should be considered, as well, to help address that scourge, he stated.
>
> In other action, the Assembly appointed Thomas Thomma (Germany) as a member of the Committee on Contributions for a term of office beginning today and ending on 31 December 2008, in order to fill a vacancy resulting from the resignation of Sujata Ghorai ( Germany).
>
> At the outset of the meeting, the Assembly observed a minute of silence and paid tribute to the memory of His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II, Head of State of Samoa, who passed away on 11 May. Expressing their condolences were the representatives of Sri Lanka (on behalf of the Asian States), Latvia (on behalf of the Eastern European States), Jamaica (on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean States), Portugal (on behalf of the Western European and other States), United States (as host country), United Republic of Tanzania (on behalf of the African States) and Tonga (on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum). The representative of Samoa thanked the speakers for their expressions of sympathy.
>
> The Assembly was also informed that Kyrgyzstan had made the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations.
>
> The Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. tomorrow, 17 May, to elect 14 members to the Human Rights Council.
