_[This past Sunday – 22-April-2007]_

According to NPR it is the megacorp giant Time Warner who is the author of the current bill in Congress for raising the relative amount small publications pay to mail out their newspaper and magazines while reducing the relative amount paid by media giants.

The expected result, more media supersaturation by an ever decreasing number of media outlets such as radio superconglomerate Clear Channel.

These people have seen what fair competition did to a hugely profitable monopoly by the Big Three Networks:
CBS, NBC and ABC, competition, which, by the way, had the effect of bringing out the Warner TV Network, but they really don't want any changes other than in what media markets they don't already rule. . .so, get out the superlobbyists and write a new law that tilts the playing field more toward the media giants along with less for the little guy. . .after all, we want to get America rolling with one voice. . .don't we?
