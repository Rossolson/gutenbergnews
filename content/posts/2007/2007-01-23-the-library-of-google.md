  Researchers always need to be reminded not to put too much trust in the materials that happen to lie within easy reach, but the risk of distortion will be much greater if they confine their investigations to a shelf of pre-selected books in a library rather than exposing themselves to the awe-inspiring quantities of treasure mixed with dross that Google spreads before them...Google may be creating new problems for scholars, but it offers new solutions too, and no one can play around with Book Search for more than a few minutes without stumbling into intellectual conflict zones that will wake them from the dogmatic doze that might have overwhelmed them in a well-regulated library.
