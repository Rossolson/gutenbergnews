German developer QiOO Interactive hosts the 'Mobile Library' – a service that brings classic books as well as modern literature to JAVA™-enabled cellphones. The portfolio ranges from Aristotle over Mark Twain to such extraordinary authors as Algernon Blackwood. As the founder Thomas Lucka states the Mobile Library will continue to release high quality books in the future – completely free of charge. Only older book releases contain a small amount of advertisment to refund the service.

Most of the newer books are launched in cooperation with [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org). If people adopt the service there will soon be more mobile books available from Project Gutenberg. Depending on the file size of the texts provided by Project Gutenberg some books require newer phone hardware.

<!--more-->All mobile books can be downloaded as JAVA™-applications from the internet and can then later be installed on the cellphone by using Bluetooth, serial connection, infrared or data cable. Additionally it is possible to install the books directly over the air by using WAP. Each mobile book is programmed with J2ME / JavaME technology to achieve a well formatted layout with correct line breaks and page numbers. At the moment all currently available MIDP 2.0-enabled cellphones are supported.

But what are the benefits of reading books on small cellphone screens? Mobile books don't weight very much and you can carry them with you wherever you are. So each user can have his own personalized library. All mobile books of the Mobile Library offer features such as bookmarks and adjustable font sizes.

In Japan reading eBooks while on the go is already a big trend. People enjoy to read all kinds of stories while sitting e.g. in the subway train or at the beach. Mobile gaming, taking photos with the built-in camera or even watching television on cellphones is now widely accepted and the Mobile Library adds another interesting new opportunity to make use of current mobile technologies.
