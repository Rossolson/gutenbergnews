On Canada Day 2007 the new <a href="http://gutenberg.ca" target="new">Project Gutenberg Canada</a> went live! As one would expect the site multilingual in both English and French.

To celebrate their opening they released a "baker's dozen: thirteen ebooks" which were specially created for the launch. With Canada's copyright at life+50 years, they will likely be producing some new books than countries with longer copyrights.

In his <a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/bparchive?year=2007&post=2007-07-20,1" target="new">recent post</a> on the Book People list, <a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu" target="new">John Mark Ockerbloom</a> said,

> There's two things I find particularly exciting about the site. One is that it will help encourage more popular Canadian content to go online. (Our kids are Canadian-Americans growing up in the states, so we'd love to see more Canadian content accessible to them.) The other is that it's a Gutenberg site in a country that still has "life+50 years" copyright terms. (Gutenberg Australia was another such site when it started, but Australia has extended its copyright terms since then.) So Gutenberg fans in Canada and other life+50 countries will now have a site where they can read and post texts that they might not be able to post legally on other popular online literature sites.

I am hoping to be in contact with PG Canada soon to start including their stats in the Weekly Newsletter
