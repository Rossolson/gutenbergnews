A four part series on the history of reading currently in production is looking for a Project Gutenberg volunteer to participate.
Ideally, this individual has had a long involvement with Project Gutenberg, has uploaded vast numbers of books, speaks passionately about the role of books in society and the need for universal access to texts [ergo Project Gutenberg] and has some compelling personal reason for their participation.

If at all interested, please contact Judy at jruzylo@sympatico.ca.

We would be looking to shoot in mid to late summer and would be happy to travel to where you are.

The films are being produced in Toronto with a French co-producer. The roster of stories is international. It is presently slated to air in the fall 2008 in Canada (in English and French), Australia, France, Netherlands and on a couple specialty satellite channels.

We have had some discussions with PBS as the American broadcaster but have no firm commitment to date.
