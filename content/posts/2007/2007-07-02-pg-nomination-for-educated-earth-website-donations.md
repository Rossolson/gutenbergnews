Ben Lovatt, the owner of the humanitarian science/technology website <a href="http://www.EducatedEarth.net" target="new">EducatedEarth</a>, wrote to PG with the following statement.

> We raise money in donations (in addition to 10% of our profits) and give them to a different organization every month. To decide which organization should receive the money, we have our members give us suggestions on companies and we let viewers of our site vote on where to donate it. Project Gutenberg has been nominated and is in this month's poll. You're welcome to encourage your staff and website visitors to vote for you.

Let's make sure Project Guteneberg wins! Just pop along to the <a href="http://www.EducatedEarth.net" target="new">EducatedEarth</a> website and place your vote (this is found in the right side column).
