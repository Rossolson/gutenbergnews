TOP 100 HONORS PROJECT GUTENBERG

In the PC Magazine just now coming out, "The Top 100" web sites out of
millions lists Project Gutenberg for being one of the best of the best
Internet resources.

The Top 100 -- http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2168282,00.asp

Project Gutenberg is among the very oldest electronic information providers
in the world if not the oldest.

Tens of thousands of eBooks are available at PG sites www.gutenberg.org
and www.gutenberg.cc as well as thousands more at the other PG sites in:
Australia, Europe, Canada, Portugal and new sites in progress in South America.

These student projects provide a real-world, hands-on opportunity to help
bring this vast collection of new eBooks to a wider public, in more formats,
with added functionality and usefullness.

-- Michael Hart


THE @FOLIO PROJECT

by Marie Lebert, August 2007

@folio is a reading device conceived in October 1996 by Pierre Schweitzer,
an architect-designer living in Strasbourg, France. It is meant to download
and read any text and/or illustrations from the web or hard disk, in any
format, with no proprietary format and no DRM.

[Important] The technology of @folio is novel and simple, and very different
from other reading devices, past or present. It is inspired from fax and tab
file folders. The flash memory is "printed" like Gutenberg printed his books.
The facsimile mode is readable as is for any content, from sheet music to
mathematical or chemical formulas, with no conversion necessary for the
content, whether it is handwritten text, calligraphy, free hand drawing or
non-alphabetical writing. All this is difficult if not impossible on a
computer or any existing reading device.

The lightweight device is built with high-quality materials, and the LCD
screen takes 80% of the total surface and has low power consumption. The
screen is surrounded by a translucent and flexible frame that folds to
protect the screen when not in use. The data is downloaded through a USB or
Bluetooth connection.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
