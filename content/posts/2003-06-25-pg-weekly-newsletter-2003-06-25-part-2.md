----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Editorial

Hello,

At the risk of repeating ourselves from part one, I have given this
week's editorial over to a recently posted message on the PGWW list by
David Widger.

"Juliet, Charles and all the Displaced Persons' Team,

(Back in the '40s that was what DP stood for.  Do any of you young
things remember the war in "black and white"?)

It has been awhile since I have passed along a thanks for the high
quality of your work.  When the DP name is associated with a file on
Spool ready for posting I know that I will find very few and sometimes
no errors at all.

Your files take about 10-15 minutes tops to process for posting.  This
past week I have had several from other sources which took 6-8 hours
of work and one I ground away at for 12 hours.  I can start from scratch,
scan and proof and post a medium sized eBook of my own in that amount of
time.  So you see what a relief it is to have yours appear in Spool.

Keep 'em coming, and pass my thanks along to all the rest of the DP's.

David"

We would like to follow David's comments with our own huge 'THANKS'
for all your efforts, we really do appreciate the effort you put
in, and we know that things have got tough for you recently. This is
not to dismiss anyone else's effort, you really are all appreciated here at PG.

Happy reading,

Alice

============= [ SUBMIT A NEW EBOOK FOR COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE ]==============

If you have a book you would like to confirm is in the public domain in
the US, and therefore suitable for Project Gutenberg, please do the
following:

1. Check whether we have the eBook already.  Look in
	http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL
which is updated weekly.  (The searchable catalog at
http://www.gutenberg.net  lags behind by several months)

2. Check the "in progress" list to see whether someone is already
working on the eBook.  Sometimes, books are listed as in progress for
years - if so, email David Price (his address is on the list) to ask
for contact information for the person working on the book.  The "in
progress" list:
	http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

3. If the book seems to be a good candidate (pre-1923 publication
date, or 1923-1988 published in the US without a copyright notice),
submit scans of the title page and verso page (even if the verso is
blank) to:
	http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html

You'll hear back within a few days.

2) News

Radio Gutenberg update

http://www.etc-edu.com

The runoffs for DJs have been completed and it looks like "The Fishburne
Files" and "Bugsy" are here to stay. The Fishburne Files will continue to
explore the treasures of the Gutenberg Collection, and to expand Dr. Kula's
ability to give satisfying readings of the broadest possible diversity of
material.

In line with that objective, "The Files" is opening the late June - early July
broadcast series with a new reading of Shakespear's "A Midsummer's Night
Dream". This reading features 22 unique computer voices, continuing
improvement of inflection, a revised Shakespeare Pronounciation guide, and
stereo staging (left-center-right only).

"The Real Dope" will continue to unfold as a live reading, and Bugsy, Radio
Gutenberg's Programmer, is working on a means to provide daily shows of new
books that add 30 minutes or so of material every 3 to 7 days, and provide
multiple means to listen to missed episodes.

A new reading of Robert Sheckley's science fiction short "Bad Medicine" is
coming online soon. Give it a listen, you'll be suprised how far we've come
in the last 6 months! The follow up "replay" to "Bad Medicine" is "The Fall
of the House of Usher.". That's in the way of fixing a mistake ....

Brett was concerned that Shakespeare might not give us programmers enough new
ground to cover, so he's got Plato's Republic scheduled. And "The Iceberg
Express" "Diary of a U-Boat Captain" "When the Earth Shook" and Captain
Cook's Diary's are coming soon.

Tabloid Scanning Now Available.

Project Gutenberg has purchased a tabloid-sized flatbed scanner,
capable of scanning pages up to 12" by 17" (30cm x 42.5cm). Do you
have a book, magazine, sheet music, or broadside that requires an
oversized scanner?

E-mail Suzanne Shell at shells at pglaf dot org to discuss the
details.

It would be helpful to include the following in your message:
Title/author, Copyright clearance, Time constraints, Format and/or
image resolution needed (and any other special requirements). The
scanner (and Suzanne) are located in North Carolina; get in
touch--we'll figure out how best to handle your project.


                    -------------------

New and Improved service

In a bid to make the newsletter more helpful to readers who may be
blind or visually impaired and using screen reading software, we are
now able to offer the booklisting normally contained in part 3 in a
different format to make your life a little easier. An example of the
new style listing is given below. If you would like either a daily or
weekly version of this list please email me at newsletter at
schiffwood dot co dot uk, and state which version you require.

{Note to the unwary: this is an example, the real booklist is in part 3.}

3) Notes and Queries

Featured Author - Henry Handel Richardson

From Col Choat

Henry Handel Richardson (Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson) is one of
Australia's premier writers. A number of her books are at PG in the US and,
for Australian readers, and readers in other "plus fifty" countries, there
are further works at http://www.gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty.html

This brief biography has been taken from the Perry Middlemiss Literature
page:

"Henry Handel Richardson (Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson) was born in
1870 in Melbourne, Victoria. She was born in a prosperous family which later
fell on hard times. Her family lived in various towns in Victoria during her
childhood and youth and she attended Presbyterian Ladies College between the
ages of 13 and 17. (This experience was the basis for her novel 'The Getting
of Wisdom.') She excelled at music during her time at PLC and her mother
took the family (her father having died in 1879) to Europe to enable Ethel
to continue her musical studies at Leipzig.

"Ethel married J.G. Robertson in 1894 and later moved to London in 1903
where her husband has been appointed to a chair of German at the University
of London. She visited Australia again in 1912 for several months before
returning to England where she lived for the rest of her life. Ethel
Richardson died in 1946."

There is also a bibliography at Middlemiss' site at
http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/richardsonhh.html

'The Getting of Wisdom' is a classic in the genre of child autobiography. To
quote from the Oxford Companion to Australian Literature "...is comically
ironic in tone, but has a serious subject, the story of an artists painful
inner growth during her impressionable adult years."

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not updated instantly, as additional research may need to be done by our professional Chief Cataloguer, so for those who wish to obtain these new ebooks, please refer to the following section.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by proofreading just a few pages per day.

 If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

 Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned)." Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

********

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time or
technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution! Send email to
dphelp@pgdp.net saying that you are interested in post-processing and we
will help you find a project to work on.
