<a href="http://scrollbox.org/" target="_blank">Scrollbox.org</a> is an online library and e-reader. It's designed to be a simple way of reading eBooks on computers and phones with internet access.

It uses no images or video so pages load quickly, and allows users to upload books for their own use. Scrollbox remembers what you were reading last time you visited and starts you right where you left off.

The site also has a feature specifically for the iPhone that allows people to save books so that a network connection is not needed. This is great for subways, airplanes, etc. and reduces login time and expense.

Give Scrollbox.org a try if you're reading on the go!
