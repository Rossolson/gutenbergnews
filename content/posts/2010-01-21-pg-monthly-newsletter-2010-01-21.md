eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


REMINDER:  We still need a probate lawyer!!!

35 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring
on December 21, 2012 [some now saying October 11, 2011]

Leaving 2 years 11 months, 11 1/3 seasons or 35 months.

Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions,
such as that there will be affordable petabytes [2021],
and enough eBooks to fill an entire petabyte around the
same time.



HEADLINE NEWS



BIG TROUBLE IN TERABYTEVILLE!


BIG PORTABLE POCKET USB DRIVE RECALL!


As I mentioned last month, the new pocket USB terabytes
came out last month, but apparently there has been some
huge problem with this, and I not only have not managed
to BUY one of these, I haven't even managed to SEE one!

I did get in touch with the Western Digital techies and
they did admit, after a little delay, that the drive is
no longer for sale, and I'm hardly sure it ever ways on
more than a very few days.

This would explain why ALL of the 89 hits I got just in
the week before had vanished when I wrote about this.

The results:

Not only is the $200 terabyte pocket USB drive not out,
but apparently this has also driven up the price of the
other larger pocket drives, though apparently not quite
all of them, as I have seen the smaller ones at the old
prices still on the shelf.  I'm not going to name names
on places to buy, but the more upscale places are quick
to push their prices up and slow to bring them down and
the cheaper places seem to be more consistent on these.



APPLE SEEMS READY TO ANNOUNCE EREADER/TABLET


If you are an Apple watcher you know that they are very
secretive about their announcements, yet this time they
have made it pretty obvious that something is coming in
the next week and should be on the market in March.

Invitations have gone out for a major press conference,
and Apple seems to have ordered massive quanties of the
parts required to build such a gizmo.

However, unless it really has outrageous bells/whistles
on the order of iPods and iPhones it probably won't see
the same kind of reception, as Apple does not sell what
we call "computers" for under $999, and I'm betting the
price will be a factor.  However, the iPhone trendiness
overcame this hurdle when they were $600 and required a
contract commitment, to boot, so you never know.




In Our Own News Bin


Project Gutenberg should be releasing the 26,00th eBook
in English about the time you are reading this:

FARTHER INTO THE FUTURE


As predicted:  a year from now, in 2011, New York Times
will start charging a flat fee to anyone who reads more
than a minimum number of articles at nytimes.com

Watch out as the entire "Information Age" becomes quite
literally "The New Digital Divide" as everything costs,
as much as the market will bear.

As always with such things, no details were available--
not the price, not the minimal free number, or and kind
of guarantee that either number will not change sooner,
rather than later, after it all begins.




U.S. COPYRIGHT EXTENSIONS


Can anything be done to stop the next U.S. extension?

or

If not stop them, at least publicize them a little?


Suggestions are more than welcome.


I should add that this is probably a losing battle even
if it looks as if we are winning.

Here's why:

When the last Australian Copyright Act was discussed in
Parliament, they passed a resolution stating they would
NOT extend copyrights.

Really.

However, just three years later, under economic warfare
from, shall we just say, outside sources, they crumbled
to the pressure and gave in.


The Canadian Parliament is currently in that position--
and while some tell me they have enough signatures from
those against any extensions, I will bet you lunch that
they, too, crumble before it is over.

I would gladly lose every one of those wagers!!!



Further Information


As you may already know, any time the copyrights in the
characters Winnie the Pooh [1926], or The Mouse [1928],
start coming close to expiration The U.S. Congress will
be sure to start a very quiet frenzy of copyright bills
that are designed to go into effect before anything can
happen to those two copyrights.

As I understand it, Disney(R) made a huge lobby effort,
successful, to create the 1976 U.S. Copyright Act; paid
as a result an additional $200 million for the right to
another 20 years of Winnie the Pooh, and still made the
fabled laughing trip to the bank as a result, since the
effective date of 1978.

As a result I have to imagine their sales of The Mouse,
Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, etc., must have been predicted
to be so terribly large as to devour Avatar's gross.

Given that next bill passed right in the middle of what
must have been the busiest day in Congress for the last
few decades, the impeachment of President Clinton, this
means we should expect something of equal secrecy quite
soon, as the current copyright extension runs out 2018.

Usually they would make an effort to pass the new one a
session or two early, such as in 2016, but given that a
snag or two has hit before, we should probably look out
starting in 2015, though it will be hard to see.

Why?

Even during the election just before the last extension
I went to ask televised press conference questions on a
new U.S. Copyright Act I had heard about, but candidate
responses were uniform. . ."I know nothing."

I would have to expect that even if the big anchors ask
the same question in 2015 they will get that answer.

Or non-answer.

&gt;/From what I have heard there is an ever larger movement
/to keep everything copyrighted permanently, and to make
all media as pay-per-view as possible, to the points of
making all broadcast television pay-per-view on a first
viewing premise [except public stations].

We are very likely to see a dissolving out boundaries--
cable products showing up on network television and the
opposite direction as well.

What else CAN we expect when Comcast cable has been the
allowed buyer of NBC?

If you think programming won't leak over:

Consider what happened when Disney took over ABC.

Not only did Disney flood ABC with their own programmed
output, but they killed off the best of all cartoons.

Anyone remember Reboot?


I can put you in touch with many copyright experts, and
I fear that all of them underestimate the power working
to make copyright permanent, in spite of the fact words
"limited time" are the U.s. Constitution's description.

However, the U.s. Supreme Court decided that limited is
really unlimited in "Eldred v Ashcroft."

Welcome To Our Newest PG Mirror. . .In Africa!!!

Continent: Africa
Nation: Namibia
Location: Windhoek
Provider: Polytechnic of Namibia

PROJECT GUTENBERG TAG CLOUD

We invite interested persons to visit a tag cloud visualization and
search system at www.bookdownloadlibrary.com

This is updated weekly, from the Project Gutenberg catalog.


iPHONE SOUGHT

Project Gutenberg is seeking donation of an iPhone, and perhaps
other modern cell phones and eBook readers.  We are working on some
new versions of content at www.gutenberg.org

These need to work, including in Europe , but without having a paid
cell phone plan.  In other words, they need to be unlocked or
unlockable.  We are particularly interested in devices that have
built-in WiFi, so they can access content at www.gutenberg.org
without using the cellular network at all.

Project Gutenberg is a charitable 501(c)(3) organization in the US.



Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!


FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The ideal piece around which to center this collection is
one of the 8 megabyte USBs.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the
Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems
and these were OEMed by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular
in a recognizable fashion because their snapon connectors
resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

We received two examples of RAM actually labeled "Flash,"
for the H-P 95 pocket DOS machine from 1991, and a sample
of Fairchild bubble memory, as well, from down under.

Thank you, Mate!



POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.





Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and
totals from PG of Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.
