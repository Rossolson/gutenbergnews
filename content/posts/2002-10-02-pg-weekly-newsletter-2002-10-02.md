<pre>*The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, October 02, 2002*
******eBooks Readable By Both Humans and Computers For Over 31 Years*****




"Project Gutenberg's Monthly Newsletter for Wednesday, October 3, 2001

11 months ago we posted our 3,000th Etext, with 100-200 reserved.
Today, we posted our 4,000th text, with only about 64 slots reserved."


  Today we Are On The Way To The 7,000th Project Gutenberg eBook!!!


Presses Used Moveable Pieces Of Type, Rather Than One Plate Per Page, From
Which Came Interchangeable Parts, The Staple Of The Industrial Revolution.

The Industrial Revolution created the strong middle classes upon which the
democracies of today were founded.  We hope Project Gutenberg provides the
examples necessary for the Neo-Industrial Revolution, which will once more
create such strong middle classes around the world.


  This Newsletter also marks the appearance of the first file published
  from the output of our new SuperScanner!!!  More about that next week.

Project Gutenberg is happy to be a finalist in the Stockholm
Challenge (http://www.challenge.stockholm.se).  On October 7-10, in
the city of Stockholm, Sweden, there will be events and festivities
culminating in an awards ceremony on October 10.

We are seeking someone to attend these events to represent Project
Gutenberg, preferably someone who lives in Europe.

If you are interested in this opportunity to represent Project
Gutenberg, please email hart@pobox.com

***

Requests For Assistance:

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

We need some help with Balzac in French:

[Sorry, French gets mangles by my emailer]

***

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

The Distributed Proofreading Team is proud to announce that they have
now completed nearly 500 e-texts! Stop on by and give us a hand with
the next 500! http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg

We currently also have eBooks needing proofing in Spanish.

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

***

A new mailing list "gut-tv@listserv.unc.edu" has been added.
This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free
eBooks This Week" which highlights the free eBooks posted in the
past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help
write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

Personal Request:

I am looking for a keyboard for my Visor Edge.

The only one I am SURE will work is the:

PA810U Targus

but there may be others.

I have tried to order many times, nothing ever arrived.

Thanks for any assistance you can provide!

I need someone with Paypal to get me one from eBay, if possible.

Thanks!!!

Michael

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04

Statistical Review

In the first 39 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,774 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 6,066 eTexts online as of October 2, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.65 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.53 when we had 3896 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.88 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

AMAZON CHANGES ITS TUNE ON PRIVACY POLICY
E-commerce giant Amazon has bowed to the wishes of a coalition of state
attorneys general and is changing its privacy policy to make it more
consumer-friendly. The changes mean the online retailer will provide
consumers with information on what specific personal data is being
collected, as well as examples of how it might be used. In addition, Amazon
says it will not sell its customer database to marketers and will close
some loopholes in its policy. Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly,
who spearheaded the group of 16 states and the District of Columbia, said
Internet sellers -- to handle consumer data carefully and confidentially."
However, Junkbusters president Jason Catlett dismissed the changes as
mostly cosmetic and called for an independent audit of Amazon's practices.
Meanwhile, a report by Forrester Research estimates that consumers'
concerns over privacy cost online retailers $15 billion in lost sales in
2001. "It's still right up there on the front of consumers' minds, so
anything Amazon and others can do to soothe those fears is important," says
Forrester analyst Christopher Kelley. (E-Commerce Times 27 Sep 2002)

E-MAIL IT TO THE JUDGE
County officials in Yakima, Washington, are setting up a program that will
enable citizens who've received traffic tickets to e-mail their
explanations and excuses to a judge rather than sit in traffic court for
hours waiting their turn. Judges will then have a choice of e-mailing their
replies or responding via old-fashioned postcard. (AP 29 Sep 2002)
http://apnews.excite.com/article/20020929/D7MBH7NG0.html

IDC, the technology research firm, is predicting that within just three
years, the number of e-mail messages sent worldwide will increase from the
current level of 31 billion daily to more than 60 billion daily. Most of it
will be spam (unsolicited commercial messages), and if the problem of spam
is not dealt with by more effective message-filtering, the usefulness of
e-mail as an effective business and personal communications tool will be
endangered. IDC executive Mark Levitt says, "Like water flowing out of a
hose, e-mail has the potential to fill our inboxes and workdays,
overwhelming our abilities to navigate through the growing currents of
content." (VNUNet 30 Sep 2002)

WIRELESS 'WARDRIVING'
Secret Service agents in Washington are driving the city's streets (in an
effort called "wardriving") to detect security holes in wireless
communications systems. Special Agent Wayne Peterson says, "Everybody wants
wireless, it's real convenient. Security has always been an afterthought."
He regards what he is doing as a normal part of police work, and compares
it to a patrolman driving through a neighborhood to make sure everyone is
safe. When he or his colleagues find a security gap, they report it to the
companies that operate the vulnerable wireless networks, so that the
problem can be fixed. The Secret Service calls security holes in wireless
communications systems one of the most overlooked threats to computer
networks. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 30 Sep 2002)

CHINA REFUSES TO ACCEPT U.S. ELECTRONIC JUNK
Customs officials in China's Zhejiang province have said they will not
accept receipt of 400 tons of electronic trash -- scrap computer monitors,
keyboards, copiers and color TV sets -- that arrived two weeks ago and has
sat unclaimed. The 22 containers, each 40 feet long, were marked
"electronic products." "As the address and telephone number on the shipping
bills are fake, we believe this is most likely a deliberate move to
transfer electronic garbage," said one official. Such items are banned
under Chinese law from entering the country, and the containers will be
returned to where they came from, said the official. (AP 26 Sep 2002)

CALIFORNIA SUES BULK MAILER
Under a four-year-old anti-spam law that has had little success in
controlling unsolicited bulk commercial mail ("spam") over the Internet,
California's attorney general has filed a $2 million lawsuit against the PW
Marketing Group for sending millions of spam messages, and for failing to
include in their messages a valid return address, as required by the law.
Calls to PW Marketing have not been returned. To explain the failure to
produce more successes over the four years in which the law has been in
effect, a spokesperson for Bill Lockyer, the California attorney general,
says that anti-spam lawsuits are "difficult, complex cases, and
time-consuming." (San Jose Mercury News 26 Sep 2002)

MUSIC ARTISTS SLAM DOWNLOADING
Record labels are using the talents of dozens of big-name recording stars,
including Madonna, Sting and Britney Spears, in a multi-million-dollar ad
campaign designed to shame people out of illegally swapping their songs.
"Would you go into a CD store and steal a CD?" asks Spears. "It's the same
thing -- people going into the computers and logging on and stealing our
music." The new ad campaign is one facet of a multipronged approach aimed
at quashing illegal file-swapping. The Recording Industry Association of
America has also sued several file-swapping sites, threatened to crack down
on companies and individual file-swappers, and lobbied for legislation that
would mandate anti-copying technology in new products. Meanwhile, a KPMG
study recently released said that instead of fighting Internet piracy, the
recording industry would be better served by devoting more time to
developing new Internet business models. (CNet News.com 25 Sep 2002)

ALBUM LAUNCHES IN STORES AND ON THE WEB SIMULTANEOUSLY
Music artist Peter Gabriel is exploring ways to incorporate legitimate
music downloading into the distribution strategy for his latest album,
"Up." On Tuesday, at the same time CDs were arriving at music stores to be
sold, the album was also available online as a hi-fidelity download

The online album is priced at $9.99 while the CD version carries a list
price of $18.98. The downloaded version can be transferred to digital audio
players supporting Microsoft's Windows Media Audio format and can also be
burned up to two times on blank CDs. While some popular singles have been
offered for sale online in the recent past, Gabriel's is the first
full-length release from a major artist. (AP 26 Sep 2002)

HACKING BY ANY OTHER NAME
A new debate in Congress over legislation proposed by Howard Berman
(D-Calif.) will have to struggle to find a definition of the word
"hacking." Berman's bill would give the recording industry the right to use
network software to inspect people's personal computer files to make sure
they do not contain copyrighted music. The congressman says there is "no
question" that the "vast majority" of peer-to-peer downloads constitute
copyright infringement, but opponents of the Berman bill say it goes too
far in invading the rights of individuals. Wayne State University professor
and computer security expert Jessica Litman says of the proposed
impair the integrity of files, it gets a complete free pass, and if it does
impair the integrity of files, it gets a qualified cheap pass." Stan
Lebowitz, a management professor at University of Texas-Dallas, comments:
"Spoofing seems like a legitimate technique for them to use. Hacking,
however, seems to go to far" -- and notes that what the bill allows "would
still qualify as hacking, under most laws and in most people's minds." (USA

'SHAREWARE' PIONEER DIES
Bob Wallace, who helped pioneer computer "shareware," has died in his home
in San Rafael, California, at age 53, of unknown causes. Shareware (a term
coined by Jay Lucas) is software that is being distributed free or for a
nominal copying charge. In the early 1980s, he copyrighted his PC-Write
word processing program and offered it as shareware, inviting satisfied
customers to then register the program for $75 and obtain a printed copy of
the manual. He said, "If I make enough money to live on, I will continue
the experiment. If not, I will approach software publishers to see if they
are interested in marketing a PC-Write II version of the program for me
commercially." As  one of the earliest Microsoft employees, he was
eventually worth as much as $15 million, but he maintained a "flower child"
not a killing." (New York Times  26 Sep 2002)

BILL AIMED TG PROTECT CONSUMERS' DIGITAL MEDIA RIGHTS
New legislation called the "Digital Choice and Freedom Act" is being
introduced in Congress by Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) to ensure that consumers
may legally copy CDs, DVDs, and other digital works for their personal use,
just as they do now with TV shows and audio tapes. Paula Samuelson, a law
professor at University of California-Berkeley's Boalt Hall, says:
"Lofgren's bill aims to restore what Congress thought it was doing [when it
passed the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act] -- preserving fair use
for people who have lawful rights to use stuff. The Lofgren bill offers
meaningful protections for a number of ordinary activities by consumers
that should be lawful under copyright law but about which the law is
presently ambiguous." (San Jose Mercury News 1 Oct 2002)

SECRET SERVICE EXPOSING UNSECURED WIRELESS NETWORKS
In an effort to inform businesses about lax security on their wireless
networks, agents from the Secret Service are wandering the streets of
Washington, D.C., looking for unprotected wireless networks. Using a
laptop, a wireless card, and one of several antennae--one made from a
Pringles can--agents drive through city streets, checking for access to
networks. Chris McFarland of the Secret Service's Electronic Crimes
Task Force said that "people can wreak havoc with [unprotected
wireless] systems." Special Agent Wayne Peterson said that on a recent
trip down one street, they found more than 20 networks, many without
any security at all. Peterson said he sees the work of securing such
networks as an important step in preventing crime.

BILL INTRODUCED TO LIMIT WEBCASTING FEES
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, introduced a bill Thursday that would grant a six-month
reprieve to Webcasters from paying royalties for online music. The
royalties, which were established by the Librarian of Congress in June,
have been the topic of heated debate between the recording industry and
Webcasters, with neither side especially happy. The recording industry
argued for higher fees, while many small Webcasters say the royalty
rate established in June will force them out of business. Webcasters
were pleased by Sensenbrenner's bill, which apparently is intended to
allow a legal challenge to the fees to be finalized before they go into
effect on October 20.

UNIVERSITY SAYS STUDENT-GROUP WEB SITE VIOLATES PATRIOT ACT
The University of California at San Diego has sent a letter to a
student group requesting that the group remove a link from its site to
the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia), a Columbian
military group. According to the letter, the student group is in
violation of the USA Patriot Act and university policy, which forbid
providing "material support or resources" to a "foreign terrorist
organization." The FARC is one of 34 organizations identified by the
U.S. State Department as terrorist groups. An official from the
university said a private citizen had contacted the school, protesting
the link to the FARC site and pointing out its apparent illegality. The
student group has refused to remove the link, and several civil
liberties groups support them. A representative from the Electronic
Frontier Foundation said the Web link to the FARC probably does not fit
the criteria of the law, which, he said, is designed to prevent
donations of money rather than free speech.

HOUSE PASSES BILL WITH EXPANSION OF FAIR USE
The House of Representatives passed an appropriations bill that
includes language that would expand the fair use of copyrighted
material in academic settings. The language was originally part of the
Technology Education and Copyright Harmonization (TEACH) Act, which
passed the Senate last year. Specifically, the bill would allow
online-education instructors to use recordings of dramatic literary and
musical works under fair-use provisions of copyright law. A conference
committee from the House and the Senate will now decide if the
copyright language remains in the appropriations bill, which must have
President Bush's signature before it goes into effect.

CHINESE GOVERNMENT CRACKS DOWN ON FREE SPEECH
Chinese officials have formally arrested Chen Shaowen, who was first
detained in August, for putting essays on the Internet critical of the
Chinese government. The arrest is the latest in a series of actions by
Communist Party officials trying to restrict what it sees as improper
content available online. In recent weeks the government has blocked
access to Google and AltaVista from inside China and prevented Chinese
Internet users from seeing Web sites run by human rights groups. Chen
has been charged with subversion, a charge that has in the past led to
sentences of up to 13 years for those convicted. A letter from the
Committee to Protect Journalists to Chinese President Jiang Zemin calls
for Chen's release, pointing out that his actions are protected by the
Chinese constitution.

NEW TOOL ALLOWS BLIND TO READ MAPS
Students in a software engineering class at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill--with help from the professor--have developed a
tool that blind and visually impaired people can use to read maps. The
Blind Audio Tactile Mapping System (BATS) uses a trackball to move a
cursor around on a map. As the cursor passes over different parts of
the map, the system plays audio information so the user can "read" the
map. For example, names of places on the map are pronounced by a voice
synthesizer. When the cursor goes over water, the user hears the sound
of crashing waves; over land, the user hears horses galloping. The
professor teaching the class in which the tool was developed said it
could become an open-source application, and it can be downloaded now
from the project's site (http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/bats/).
