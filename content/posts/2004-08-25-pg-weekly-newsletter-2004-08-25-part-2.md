.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

David Widger sends along the following from the "Translator's Preface" to
#13260, The Complete Droll Stories, by Honore de Balzac (Collected From
The Abbeys Of Touraine):

When, in March, 1832, the first volume of the now famous _Contes
Drolatiques_ was published by Gosselin of Paris, Balzac, in a short
preface, written in the publisher's name, replied to those attacks which
he anticipated certain critics would make upon his hardy experiment. He
claimed for his book the protection of all those to whom literature was
dear, because it was a work of art--and a work of art, in the highest
sense of the word, it undoubtedly is. Like Boccaccio, Rabelais, the Queen
of Navarre, Ariosto, and Verville, the great author of _The Human Comedy_
has painted an epoch.

~ ~ ~

David Price sends along the following about #13271, Rides on Railways,
by Samuel Sidney:
For those wishing to know: Samuel Sidney, born in Birmingham UK in 1813, was a
journalist who travelled around England on the railways and wrote this book
about his travels (in 1851).  It's full of amusing text and the illustrations of
England just as the railway age was getting underway are invaluable.  It's well
worth searching the text for a town in the UK to see what Samuel made of it.

~ ~ ~

If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!
