.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.

And if you haven't done so lately, please visit the website at
http://gutenberg.net to see what's new.

             Courier New or similar.

CONVERTING OLD EBOOKS TO THE NEW FILENAMING AND DIRECTORY SYSTEM:

As of 18 May 04, Project Gutenberg volunteers began the process of
manually transferring the eBooks with numbers between 1 and 10000 to the
new directory structure.  This means that the files which were
previously posted in etext dirs based on their "official release year"
are now being posted in directories based on their filename.

This process includes, where possible and practicable, repairing,
correcting, and re-formatting to current PG standards, and in the
beginning stages will be very slow.  Place-holder files are being inserted
in the original file locations, directing user's to the new location.  The
pointers on the PG search page are being updated as changes are made.

It should be noted that one of the primary benefits of the new file
system is that HTML files, especially illustrated HTML files, can now be
viewed directly online rather than having to be downloaded.

During the past month we processed the following ebooks per the above:
