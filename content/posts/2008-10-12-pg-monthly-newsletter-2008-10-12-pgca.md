<pre>Here's the news from PG Canada for September.

We published a total of 13 ebooks during the month: we have now published a
cumulative total of 177 ebooks.

The New Releases section at the top of the PGC main page always gives the
details of new releases for the most recent three months.

LANGUAGES:
- 5 titles were in English
- 8 were in French

GENRES
- 7 of the books were novels (the 7 ebooks represented 5 novels, since we
    published Henry Gréville's "Les Koumiassine" in two parts, and followed
    the same course with "Le moulin Frappier").
- 1 was a children's book
- 1 was a collection of poems
- 1 was an issue of a literary magazine
- 3 were non-fiction: a collection of essays, a book of history, and a biography

One of PG Canada's objectives is to have a strong collection of ebooks in
French.  We were delighted that this month an actual majority of the new
titles we offered are in French!

Five of this month's ebooks were by Canadians.

One of the highlights of the month was the completion of our collection of
major works by the eminent novelist, poet, dramatist, and translator
Pamphile Le May (1837-1918): we now offer no fewer than 18 of his works.

We published four novels in our continuing series of novels by
Henry Gréville (1842-1902).

Authors and illustrators new to PGC this month included:

Charlesworth, Hector Willoughby (1872-1945) [Canadian journalist and essayist]
Garneau, François-Xavier (1809-1866) [Historien et poète canadien] Graham,
George Rex (1813-1894) [Publisher]
