Back in January we mentioned that there was [going to be a Newsletter Team](https://www.gutenbergnews.org/20080123/newsletter-team-is-born/ "The Project Gutenberg Newsletter Team"). Unfortunately this will now not happen.

Project Gutenberg is therefore putting forward a request for volunteers to help out with the weekly newsletter. Everyone is welcome to participate no matter what your background.

Please use our [Contact page](https://www.gutenbergnews.org/contact/ "PG-News Contact Us Page") and let us know your interest. All messages will be forwarded directly to Michael Hart.
