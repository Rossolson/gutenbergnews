Another year is over for Project Gutenberg and as always it has been a busy one. Although we started out a little slow we had a great charge in the last few months, yet again our volunteers posted over four thousands new titles. We hit some impressive milestones along the way and also welcomed some new projects; PG Canada and DP Canada.

The combined PG projects have now produced a total of **26,161** titles, a fantastics effort by all involved and I don't see any reason why we won't reach the 30,000 mark before the end of 2008!

The usual newsletter statistics are presented as normal but I would like to outline a few interesting numbers here.<!--more-->

The most number of books posted...
...in one **day** was **65** on the **26th December**
...in one **week** was **151** in **Week 18** (week ending 9th May)
...in one **month** was **477** in **November**

We averaged **338** books per month, **78** per week and **11.13** per day.

**99** titles have been REposted to the new filing system, bringing us almost to the 2,000 mark...not too bad but I am sure we can do much better for 2008!

Here is a small selection of project milestones;
