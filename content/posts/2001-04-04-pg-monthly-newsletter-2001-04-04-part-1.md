137 Total New Project Gutenberg Etexts Announced Today!!!


***Headline News***


We have been averaging 1,000 per year since the beginning of the year!
It's been only 4 months since we announced Etext #3,000 on December 6!

*Today marks the beginning of the end of the beginning of our project*

I say this because we have probably just entered the first year I will
get to announce our volunteers have done 1,000 Etext in one year!!!

Today's Newsletter will announce approximately 125 Etexts, ranging the
official release periods from September, 2001 to September, 2002. . .!


Since several of the listservers that relay our Newsletter have stated
that their email programs have problems with our Newsletter when those
titles we list exceed even 75, we are going to have to split to having
two Newsletters.  Let me know if you would prefer it done like this on
a monthly basis, or if you would prefer something like the first/third
Wednesdays of each month, or perhaps even a weekly Newsletter.

We have had a monthly Newsletter since before 99.99% of the population
of the Net had access, so we will continue with a monthly version from
now until July 4, which will be our 30th anniversary, and then choose,
perhaps to weekly, perhaps to bi-monthly. . .your choice.  Right now I
think it looks as if it will be weekly, each one containing some 20-25
index listings, as that might be the optimal size for the mailers.

With 3333 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.00 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.
*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

This month we have managed to reach #3333 for a "price" of $3.00 per copy
to have given away our goal of $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars]
with a total of 833 Etext titles from April 5, 2000 to April 4, 2001
[Yes, this includes 13 months of work announced in 1 calendar year.]

This "cost" is currently $3.00 as we have 3333 Etexts on April 4

This "cost" is down from $3.10 when we had 3225 Etexts on March 7
This "cost" is down from $3.17 when we had 3150 Etexts on February 6
This "cost" is down from $3.23 when we had 3100 Etexts on January 3
This "cost" is down from $3.33 when we had 3000 Etexts on December 6
This "cost" is down from $3.40 when we had 2940 Etexts on October 18/Nov 1
This "cost" is down from $3.48 when we had 2870 Etexts on September 3
This "cost" is down from $3.55 when we had 2820 Etexts on August 16
This "cost" is down from $3.60 when we had 2775 Etexts on August 2
This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2650 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts on April 5



Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by $1.00???
In a period of only 12 calendar months???

If we are going to do 1,000 Etexts per year, we have to average
83 1/3 Etext per month, or about 3 per day.  As you can see, we
have only just recently been able to average that much, and our
processes will have to continue to improve to maintain such big
production levels. . .we are currently scheduled for 50 Etext a
month. . .which is all _I_ can comfortably handle with our olde
methods of production. . .hence the need for more improvements.
If you would like to help us write perl scripts or other script
languages or programs to assist in the cleaning up of Etexts or
adding the header material, please let me know . .this would be
a HUGE help in continuing at this level!

Here is our approximate rate of production over the last year:
[I have calculated a moving average show our growth more easily
. . .I rounded down]

It's rather amazing we have been able to keep up at this level,
especially given all the crashes and downtime early this year.

From: Alev Akman &lt;alevwho@mediaone.net&gt;
I found out that the book I have started to scan,
The Intrusion Of Jimmy by P.G. Wodehouse, has one page ripped.
It's in the chapter titled Molly; page 31-32.  Copyright 1910
If anyone can xerox this for me, please let me know.  Thanks!

*

The 2000 CIA Factbook is out.  And. . .
We also have a partially formatted version of the
1999 Factbook that needs about 10 hours of editing.
So we need help with both of these.

Or download the .zip files, which unzip properly for
nearly any operating system they are unzipped for...

"David J. Cole" &lt;david_j_cole@yahoo.com&gt; has a scanner and would like
to scan books for Project Gutenberg volunteers.  If you want to ship
him books, that would be fine. . .he is in Massachusetts. . . .




hart@pobox.com is usually the best address to email me at, rather than
just hitting the "reply" key. . .the reason is that right now I divide
my day between hart@prairienet.org for doing most of my email, and for
posting the books I tend to use hart@beryl.ils.unc.edu and then send a
few emails from there while I am directly working on the Etexts. . .it
is ok to send to BOTH hart@pobox.com these other addresses, I will get
two copies.

and

We have copyright clearances for a few people who didn't include their
email addresses with their title page xeroxes. . . .

This month these include, but are not limited for:

Benedict Arnold

Please include your email address when you send us snailmail. . .!
