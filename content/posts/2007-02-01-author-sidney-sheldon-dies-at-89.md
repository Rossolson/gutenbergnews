    Sidney Sheldon, best-selling US author of Rage of Angels and The Other Side of Midnight, has died at the age of 89. He died of complications from pneumonia at a hospital near Palm Springs, California, his publicist said. Before turning to novels at the age of 50, Sheldon had a successful career writing Broadway plays and films. He won an Academy Award in 1948 for The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer, starring Cary Grant, and created long-running TV series Hart to Hart. But it is his hugely popular novels – devoured by readers though scorned by critics – for which he will be remembered.
