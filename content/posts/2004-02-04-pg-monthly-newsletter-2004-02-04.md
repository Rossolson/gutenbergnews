IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT FILENAMES:  Due to recent security concerns, some
mail servers are still deleting email messages that contain the name of
a certain popular file compression program as the filename extension.
That three-letter word begins with the letter "z".  In order to
circumvent this problem, as a temporary measure, we are replacing that
extension with ".000" in the listings below.  We hope to have a
permanent solution in the next couple of weeks.  Thank you for your
patience.

.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

  http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).

And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language at the above
link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.

To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest to you,
visit:

  http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

EBooks numbered 1 to 10000 are located in "release year" directories.
Over time, the "release year" advanced, so that by November 2003 the
release year was 2006.  Starting with eBook #10001, they are filed by
their official eBook number, with a unique subdirectory based on that
eBook number.

FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED GREATER THAN 10000

To get to a directory listing you can use either:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/

. . .navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the
appropriate level, and then select the file you wish to download,
using your usual download procedures.  This system works on mirrors,
too, and will hold all eBooks starting with the number "1" for
10,000 and beyond.


FOR EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000:

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download site (or
a mirror) if you know the filename and year you want.  For example:

  http://gutenberg.net/etext06/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

                              ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

     Note:  this listing best viewed with a fixed-width font, such as
            Courier New or similar.

=============================================================================

172 years ago, on 27 Jan 1832, in Daresbury, Cheshire, England, Lewis Carroll
(Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) was born.  In celebration of that event, herewith
a passage from "Alice in Wonderland", Project Gutenberg eBook #11, which, if
you've read this far, may or may not be relevant:

   'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.

   'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  'we're all mad here.
   I'm mad.  You're mad.'

   'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.

   'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'
