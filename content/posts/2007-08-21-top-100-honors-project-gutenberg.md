In the issue of PC Magazine, their "Top 100" web sites out of millions lists Project Gutenberg for being one of the best of the best Internet resources.

_[Update 2017: the linked webpage is no longer available so I've removed the link.]_

Project Gutenberg is among the very oldest electronic information providers in the world if not the oldest.

Tens of thousands of eBooks are available at PG sites <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" target="new">www.gutenberg.org</a> and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.cc" target="new">www.gutenberg.cc</a> as well as thousands more at the other PG sites in:

  * Australia
  * Europe
  * Canada
  * Portugal*

and new sites in progress in South America.

These student projects provide a real-world, hands-on opportunity to help bring this vast collection of new eBooks to a wider public, in more formats, with added functionality and usefullness.

* The gutenberg.org site has been translated into Portuguese. Portugal otherwise only has mirrors.
