<pre>Dear Sir,
         in your December newsletter you included a request
for someone to rewrite and "tidy up" the newsletter format.
Accordingly, I respectfully submit the following draft for
your consideration. It is somewhat shorter than the original
text, but this is due (I hope) to the repetition of
information in the original, rather than any omissions.

1. About this Newsletter

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for December, 1993
It is a statement of the Project's current status. It is
also your guide to the availability of Gutenburg texts, and
the means of accessing these texts.

For those who have not heard of the Gutenburg Project, we
recommend that you read this document in its entirety. For
those who just want to know what's available, have a look
at sections four and five. If you're already familiar with
the newsletter, just browse through the next section.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Items new to this newsletter
{Hot Items to be placed here, then shifted to an
 appropriate section before the next publication}

Project Gutenberg congratulates Internet Wiretap and the Oxford
Text Archives on increased creation and distribution of Etexts,
and would also like to congratulate the Online Book Initiative.
A special congratulations to our first corporate sponsor of the
copyrighted Complete Works of Shakespeare:  World Library.  You
can get over a thousand Etexts from the World Library on CDROM.
Please email them at julianc@netcom.com or call 1-800-443-0238,
or 1-714-748-7197 or fax 1-714-748-7198.

Thank you NeXT, for loaning us that machine!!!  Thanks also to
Apple, Calera, CTA (TextPert), IBM, Caere and World Library.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3. What is Project Gutenburg?

Project Gutenburg is a non-profit organisation, established
in 1971, dedicated to the production and distribution of
electronic texts (Etexts). Project Gutenburg Etexts are
prepared by hundreds of volunteers and donations.
Our goal is to give away One Trillion Etexts by
December 31, 2001.

[We estimate that every title will reach 100 million people
by the end of 2001, so this goal would require publishing
10,000 titles.]

In an effort to make Project Gutenburg Etexts universal we
have ended each line with a "carriage return" AND a "line
feed" so a user on any computer can read them. Macs require
a cf, UNIX machines require a lf, DOS machines require both.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Availability of Gutenburg Etexts

This is _NOT_ a complete listing, but a general guide as to
where Gutenburg publications may be found.

4.0  General info
4.1  Index sites
4.2  Anon. FTP sites
4.3  BBS sites
4.4  E-mail services

- 4.0 General info -

About getting Project Gutenberg Etexts before the end of
months: the official release date of each of our books is
the last day of the month.  If you get any books before that
date please check on the first days of the next month to
insure you have the permanent copy rather than a preliminary
copy.  Many errors are corrected a few days before the
official release date.

- 4.1 Indexes -

Project Gutenberg is testing a new indexing program.
You can get this index, which is updated daily, by:

anonymous FTP to mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu (128.174.201.12)
              etext/0INDEX.GUT

- 4.2 Anonymous FTP sites -

Some of our etexts are available via the Cleveland Freenet.
You can call via modem at 1-216-368-3888.

- 4.4 E-mail Services -

****
FTPMail service which allows FTP requesta via EMail.  The address is:

                ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com

If you want to get a file in this way try sending your equivalent of the
following message to the above address. You don't need a subject. If you are
lucky you will receive your etext by email. I use Compuserve which has a 50K
maximum file size which is why I have to request my files broken
up into 50K chunks.

        connect 128.174.201.12  (this is the address of the ftp server)
        chdir etext/etext93   (this changes to the right directory)
        chunksize 50000       (this gives the maximum size file I can receive)
        ascii             (use "binary" if you want to get a compressed file)
        get wman10.txt    (this is the file name and file type of the etext.
        quit              (this is self-explanatory)

****
The Almanac Information Server, located at the Extension Service
at Oregon State University, allows text retrieval both through ftp and
email.

To retrieve a file via e-mail, first send the following line by
itself to almanac@oes.orst.edu

     send gutenberg catalog

This will instruct you how to send further requests, and will list
the available files.  For example, to retrieve _Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland_, send to almanac@oes.orst.edu

     send gutenberg alice
****
-----------------------------------------------------------
5. Index of the first 100 Gutenburg Etexts

This is an index of the first 100 Project Gutenberg Etexts [gutindex.100]
It is no longer part of the Newsletters but will be independently sent.
The January, 1994 Newsletter will start again with the 1994 indices.

For now the 1994 Etexts are being stored in etext/etext93 so you can get
them more easily for Holiday Season gift giving.  In 1994 they will move
to etext/etext94.  For those who wish to volunteer early, we should like
to try to get the 200th Etext out by Thanksgiving, 1994, as we have seen
that a huge portion of you are rarely on the nets during the Holidays.

[A "C" following the number indicates a copyrighted Etext.  When we get
the permission to post a copyrighted Etext in our CDROMs, or on another
fee-based access medium, the "C" will be changed to a lower cased "c"].

You may note that by the standards by which we started Project Gutenberg
in 1971 that the following list contains closer to 300 Etext titles, for
we originally indexed each book of the Bible, and each Shakespeare play,
major poem, and the Sonnets, as a single file, most of which were larger
than our entire output for the 1970's.  By those standards the Bible and
Shakespeare alone represent nearly 150 titles [two Bible editions] and a
new Shakespeare is in the works.

***Earlier Dates Are Approximations***
1980-1990 Various Editions of Shakespeare and The Bible

the U.S. Declaration of Independence.  [So is Shakespeare.]
