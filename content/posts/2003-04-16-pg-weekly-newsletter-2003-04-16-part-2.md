1) Editorial

Hello,

What's that saying? You wait ages and then three come along at
once. Usually this is a reference is to the UK bus system, but in this
case it's your newsletter. To make things easier on the eyesight and
so that you can access the sections you like the most first, we have
demerged it. We would like to know what you think, so please let us
know at the address below. All contributions welcome for the
Shakespeare special next week (Do I sound desparate yet?), and there
is a nice piece below about Nobel Prize Winners from Col Choat.

Happy and peaceful reading,

Alice

(newsletter at schiffwood.co.uk - If you hit reply, the mail you
send does not reach me and disappears into the ether.)

We welcome feedback, critisism (of any kind), ebook reviews, featured
author suggestions, writings and awkward questions at the address above. Please feel free to send our general ramblings to a friend.

2) News

PG on DVD!

This week at Geek Lunch I showed off our first DVD,
compliments of Devin Casenhiser, which has all of
our files up to around Valentine's day when Greg
Newby backed up everything on CDs for the DVD.

It's fantastic. . .over 8,000 files, one whole
copy of the Human Genome, and still only 1/2 full!

Looks as if we will be able to put the entire PG
collection on ONE DVD at the end of this year,
Human Genome and all!!!

The Nobel Prize for Literature
------------------------------

The Nobel Prize for Literature was first awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme.
Since that year it has been awarded every year, except for six occasions
during the First and second World Wars. The list of laureates may be viewed
at the official Nobel site at

http://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/index.html.

Winners include

1907   Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936)
1913   Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941)
1923   William Butler Yeats (1865-1939)
1925   George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950)
1930   Sinclair Lewis (1885-1951)
1932   John Galsworthy (1867-1933)
1936   Eugene O'Neill (188-1953)

We will soon be starting a Nobel Prize page at Project Gutenberg of
Australia to highlight the individual works by these authors and to
provide for easy download of the ebooks available from Project
Gutenberg and Project Gutenberg of Australia.

I believe that all of the above authors are represented at PG or PGofOz,
with the exception of Eugene O'Neill. Since his work enters the public
domain in Australia in 2004, we hope to correct that deficiency next year.

If you are aware of any other Nobel Prize winners represented at PG, which
are not listed above, please email me at colc@gutenberg.net.au so that
they can be shown on our Nobel page.

A worthwhile project would be to endeavour to have online all works
by these authors (and any which I may have missed )which are in the
public domain.

And, as I am sure Alice would agree, there is plenty of material in the
subjects of Nobel Prize and Nobel Laureates and their works to provide some
interesting articles for the newsletter and/or the PGofOz Nobel page.

3) Notes and Queries

A contribution of a different kind this week. If you would like to
read the Time Out article that mentions PG, run along to

http://www.timeoutny.com/byteme/386/386.tech.opner.html


Well, as I said at the top. We've ran out, so please help fill this
space by sending along questions or contributions to

newsletter at schiffwood.co.uk.

Please remember that just hitting reply doesn't work
as your mail will just disappear never to be read again.

Contributions for the Shakespeare special and Nobel prize winners
gladly accepted.






This space to let.
