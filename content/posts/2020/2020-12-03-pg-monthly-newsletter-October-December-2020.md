## Thank you, David Widger

Dr. David Widger was the longest-serving member of the Project Gutenberg production team. The team is known as the "whitewashers," after the famous scene in Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer. He is stepping back from his high level of activity, and retiring as a whitewasher.

You can find over 4,800 eBooks that Dr. Widger created at this link:
> <http://www.gutenberg.net.au/widger/home.html>

Altogether, he produced, corrected, modified to meet present standards, or simply checked and posted an astounding 35,420 eBooks. This means that Dr. Widger had a hand in processing, creating or improving over half of the entire Project Gutenberg collection.

David Widger was amazingly productive, as well as an excellent mentor and colleague. He leaves a legacy of activity spanning from 2003-2020, and was a model volunteer for sustained output and integrity. It is no exaggeration to say that the world of eBooks would not be the same without Dr. David Widger's contributions to Project Gutenberg.
