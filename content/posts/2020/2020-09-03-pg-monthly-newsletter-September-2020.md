## New website is live!

The Project Gutenberg website, <https://www.gutenberg.org>, relaunched on August 26 2020 with an updated look. Nearly all of the prior functionality is still available, but the website content is revised and reorganized. The eBooks themselves are exactly the same, and may be displayed, downloaded and shared as usual.

This page summarizes the intentions behind the website redesign, and also mentions issues that are still being addressed:

> <https://www.gutenberg.org/help/new_website.html>

The page also mentions how to get in touch, if you are having trouble or find an error. Huge THANKS to our website hosts, iBiblio (<https://www.ibiblio.org>), to our students, volunteers, and programmers. We also thank the many people who have viewed the test site over past months, and gave input to the new design.


## 60,000+ ebooks fit on a flash drive

There are still parts of the world where access to the global internet is limited. Rural parts of world from Alaska to Africa have bandwidth to that is unevenly distributed. Even in New Jersey, a tropical storm recently knocked out power and internet on our street for several days. We've recently seen governments cut off website and apps from overseas.

USB flash drives that can store 128GB are now available for only $20 - that's more than enough storage for all 60,000 books in Project Gutenberg.
