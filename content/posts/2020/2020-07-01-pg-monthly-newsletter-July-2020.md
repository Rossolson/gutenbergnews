## Forty-nine years of eBooks!

July 4 is the date we celebrate Michael Hart's invention of eBooks. You can find his telling of the story here:

> <https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:The_History_and_Philosophy_of_Project_Gutenberg_by_Michael_Hart>

For forty-nine years, Project Gutenberg has digitized and distributed eBooks. They are intended to be absolutely free for anyone to read or redistribute, anywhere in the world that it is legal to do so.

From 1971 through the 1980s, a few dozen eBooks were created. These were mostly typed (transcribed) by hand from printed volumes, although a few were contemporary works that were "born digital" and then contributed to Project Gutenberg.

By the early 1990s, Michael focused on a regular cadence of new productions, seeking to release some new eBooks every month throughout a year. And then, in the next year, to double the production. This required developing some guidelines for eBook production, and expanding the corps of volunteers working on new eBooks.

At the same time, interest in online content projects was blossoming around the world. Many efforts were focused on online versions of published literature, as well as ways that individuals could generate their own content. This is years before social media, and most individuals (and organizations) had little access to the Internet and websites of the times. Project Gutenberg has repeatedly been lauded as a great place to find something to read, and a tremendous resource for educators and others.

Project Gutenberg's sustained efforts from 1971 to the present make it one of the oldest online content projects in the world. Michael Hart's tireless efforts to lead the creation and distribution of free online literature, supported by thousands of volunteers, made it all possible.

You can help to celebrate free eBooks and the positive benefit they have on individuals and society:

  - read them!
  - share them!
  - help create more!

Project Gutenberg is thankful to everyone who helps to fulfill its mission:  

>   "To encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks."

## New website

We have continued to work on the new website, and all functionality is now present! This has been a huge effort of modernization and behind the scenes updates. We are now working on choices for the color scheme, logos, fonts, etc. and hope to launch the new site during the month of July.

You can find the new website at dev.gutenberg.org, and it is intended to work well with mobile devices and other smaller screens, as well as full-size computer monitors.

The website has a link to a brief survey, to solicit input and ideas. THANK YOU to everyone who has helped with shaping this new website for Project Gutenberg.
