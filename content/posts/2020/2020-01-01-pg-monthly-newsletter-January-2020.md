## Public Domain Day 2020

In the United States, the public domain grows every year on January 1. When the limited term of copyright protection under the U.S. Constitution expires, protected items become owned by the people. Project Gutenberg digitizes, proofreads, and distributes literature that is not protected under U.S. copyright.

You can read more about the many items that are now owned by the people in the U.S., at Duke's "Public Domain Day 2020" website: 
> <https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2020/>

You can read Project Gutenberg's collection development policy, which emphasizes the American Library Association's "Freedom to Read" principles, here:

There are many different roles for the different steps involved in digitizing a printed book to make a Project Gutenberg eBook. Beginners are welcome, and there is an online tutorial to get started.
