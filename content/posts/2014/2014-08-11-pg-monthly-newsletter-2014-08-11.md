* Outernet affiliation

Outernet is a new Project Gutenberg affiliate.  Here is information
about their activity, which officially launches on Monday August 11:

"Today Outernet opens the doors to humanity's public library. Using
existing geostationary satellites, Outernet will broadcast a signal
that will contain, in this early test phase, Project Gutenberg
literature, Wikipedia articles, and news from Deutsche Welle. In a
world where only 35.5% of humanity has access to the information on
the Internet, this marks an enormous step towards universal
information access. All Outernet content is available for free to
anyone who wants it. Users are invited to contribute to Outernet's
open source software and open hardware. Outernet has released details
on how to assemble a receiver to access the Outernet signal, available
on their website.

Syed Karim, Outernet's CEO, says, 'For decades, Project Gutenberg has
been pioneering increased access to knowledge and dissemination of the
wealth of creativity found in public domain works. Outernet is honored
and excited to have Project Gutenberg as both a launch partner and
critical element of the Outernet core archive.'"

Greg Newby, Director of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation, said: "I'm thrilled at the Outernet vision of free-to-air
broadcast of eBooks and other content.  It is Project Gutenberg's
mission to encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks.  We have
a focus on free access to information for all people, in the pursuit
of literacy and enlightenment.  Outernet has a vision that is
wonderfully aligned with Project Gutenberg, encompassing free access,
freedom from censorship and monitoring, and unlimited distribution.  I
am enthusiastic about Outernet's effort to bring eBooks from Project
Gutenberg and other great collections to a broader audience."

Outernet is online at  www.outernet.is


* CD/DVD ISO maker and MARC records

In our previous newsletter, we announced some changes to the back-end
offline catalog that caused an interruption in service to the Machine
REadable Cataloging (MARC) files, as well as our CD/DVD ISO maker
(http://pgiso.pglaf.org).  We are pleased to confirm that MARC is
back, and the CD/DVD ISO maker will be back this week.

We appreciate the efforts of Steve Thomas of University of Adelaide
for the MARC conversion.  Thanks go to Marcello Perathoner, Project
Gutenberg's Webmaster, for outstanding service to Project Gutenberg.
