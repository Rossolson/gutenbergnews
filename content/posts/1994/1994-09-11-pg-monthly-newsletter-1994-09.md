NOTES FROM THE DIRECTOR

We have recruited a Project Gutenberg Coordinator to assist the volunteers.
Mark P. Line (gutcoord@jg.cso.uiuc.edu) is an experienced coordinator, and
will be happy to assist those who have volunteered: especially volunteers
who have not found the right Etexts to work on, or those who need help for
the completion of Etexts too large for one person to handle.

Again, my most sincere apologies to those volunteers who felt they weren't
getting the instructions or cooperation required for them to fulfill their
hopes and Project Gutenberg Volunteers; Mark's presence is the result of
a rather intensive search, and we hope you will be very glad to have him.&nbsp;

As always, I am terrified of the prospect of doubling our output to 16 Etexts
per month for next year, we really need your help!!!

HOT OFF THE PRESSES--NEW INFORMATION

*August 26th, 1994 marked the 74th Anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the
*U.S. Constitution, on which date we announce the release of these etexts

You can find the U.S. Constitution and amendments as Project Gutenberg Etexts
#2 and #3, dated 1972 and 1973 in /pub/etext/etext90 as per directions
below.

A "C" following the Etext number indicated a COPYRIGHTED Electronic
Text.

Please note: neither this list nor its contents are final till midnight of
the last day of the the month of this announcement. The official release
date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at Midnight, Central Time, of the
last day of the stated month. A preliminary version may often be posted for
suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so. To be sure you
have an up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes in
the first week of the next month. Since our ftp program has a bug in it that
scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a look at the file size will
have to do, but we will try to see a new copy has at least one byte more
or less.

THE GUTENBERG PROJECT

The Gutenberg Project, founded in 1971 by Michael Hart, who still directs
the project, is aimed towards making public-domain documents freely available
in electronic form. What this means to you is that there are now many novels,
short-stories, reference books, and information texts available over the
internet, from your local network, or on disk. (Methods of obtaining the
texts are explained in detail in section 4.) At present, over one hundred
full texts are available, ranging from Moby Dick, through the Declaration
of Independance and the Bible, to the CIA World Fact Book.

These texts were produced through the work of hundreds of volunteers, and
aided by many donations. (Yes, you can take that as a hint.)

The texts are all entered in "Plain Vanilla ASCII." This means that they
use only those characters which work on all systems, and can be easily read
by both humans and machines.

In an effort to make Project Gutenberg Etexts universal, we have ended each
line with a "carriage return" AND a "line feed". (Macs require a cr, UNIX
needs an lf, DOS machines require both.

Macs users CAN remove these characters [which Macs use for mark at end of
paragraph] with UUlite, while UNIX users can used the flip or toix command.
[Mac users should be forewarned that the remargination of Etexts can have
some very odd results, back-up your file before you try it.]

ELECTRONIC TEXT AVAILABILITY

4.1 Obtaining texts via ftp at MRCNEXT
4.2 Alternate ftp sites with Gutenberg and/or other Etexts.
4.3 Retrieving texts by E-MAIL using ALMANAC
4.4 Requesting Etexts on Disk or CD
4.5 From Bulletin Board Services

4.1 Obtaining texts via ftp at MRCNEXT

The primary site (ie. this is where all texts make their first appearance)
for retrieving etexts is from the MRCNEXT system. From your home system,
do the following (NB: if you are using a Macintosh or equivalent window-based
system, we recommend that you actually _type_ these commands, since the
file-server is UNIX based, and therefore case-sensitive):
ftp mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu OR
ftp 128.174.201.12
login anonymous
password [PUT HERE your e-mail address]
cd etext
cd etext91, etext92, etext93 or etext94
ls
[this will produce a list of filenames
available]
get filename
[where 'filename' stands for the text
you have selected]
quit

4.2 ALTERNATE FTP SITES

etext.archive.umich.edu
cd pub/Gutenberg/etext91, 92, 93, 94

nctuccca.edu.tw [192.83.166.10, 140.111.1.10]
cd /documents/electronic-texts/Gutenberg

cd /pub/e.texts/gutenberg/etext91, 92, 93, 94

quake.think.com
cd /pub/etext91, 92, 93, 94

oak.oakland.edu
wuarchive.wustl.edu
ftp.cnam.fr

4.3 VIA MAIL

To retrieve a file via E-mail, first send the following message to the server
at ALMANAC@OES.ORST.EDU:

send gutenberg catalog

This will give you a list of available files, along with instructions on
how to retrieve them.

You might also wish to try the FTPmail service, which allows FTP requests
via Email. The address is:

ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com

Send a message (no subject) with the following body:

connect 128.174.201.12
(the address of the ftp server)
chdir etext/etext93
(or etext/etext94 etc.)
chunksize 50000
(breaks the incoming file into 50k chunks)
get wman10.txt
(the file name you wish to receive)
quit
(quit)

4.4 DISKS

We are in the process of setting up new people to mail out disks.

For now:

Requests for disks should go to: John Mechalas (pgdisks@jg.cso.uiuc.edu)
