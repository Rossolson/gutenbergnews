Catalog Updates:  Thanks to the work of Marcello Perathoner,
there is no longer a delay getting new eBooks into our
searchable database at http://www.gutenberg.net.  Author and
title information, as well as links directly to the eBook's
files (in all available formats) are updated nightly.

and. . . .

A new page with eBooks posted (or changed) the day before:

http://www.gutenberg.net/gutenberg/browse/RECENT.HTM

***

We have the first copy of our "10K Special" DVD nearly ready, more below.
Let me know you the URL to download, or need us to snail a copy to burn.
Sending out another copy today, but next week will be the last before I
hit the road to our conference in San Francisco.


    ***    gutenberg.net moved to ibiblio.org/gutenberg   ***

After many happy years at http://promo.net/pg, we have moved
gutenberg.net to a different server over the upcoming days.

Many Thanks To Promo.net!!!!!!!

There have been a few days of transition, as the Internet name servers
got their updates.  When the transfer is complete,   gutenberg.net
(including www.gutenberg.net)   will still work correctly, but will
point to our NEW Web pages at     http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg

Hopefully 99% of the bumps in the road caused by this are now over.

***  HOT Requests!!!


For those of you who are trying to get some PR for Project Gutenberg:


In November, 2003, the UPI [United Press International] said:

"These are momentous times in the digital content industry. . . .

"Project Gutenberg - the pioneering and largest depository of free
eBooks - added the 10,000-th title to its unsurpassed collection."

***

"The best way to get the future you want. . .is to invent it."

"I wanted a computer full of 10,000 eBooks. . .and not just for me,
but for everyone."

Michael S. Hart

***

     A few years ago WIRED said:
"On The Verge Of Achieving The Impossible."

             And now. . . .

Project Gutenberg has just released their 10,000th eBook,
exactly 18 months, to the week, after their 5,000th. . .

. . .thus putting to rest that human-driven enterprises
can't keep up with Moore's Law of growth for a decade.

Nearly all the time you see graphs of this nature, they are predictions. . . .

In this case it is an accomplished fact.  The "/" marks the exact date.


All the 10,000 eBooks, except the Human Genome Project
and the audio books, due to size limitations, and the
Project Gutenberg of Australia eBooks, due to copyright,
will hopefully be available shortly on a single DVD.

By the end of their 2003 production year, there should
be around 11,000 Project Gutenberg eBooks. . .

20,000 by the end of 2005!!!

1,000,000 by 2015!!!!!!!

"A Whole Elephant Full Of Books"

If each of the 10,000 Project Gutenberg eBooks were printed out
in a standard hardback format, using 3/4" of paper and 1/4" binding,
weighing one pound, the entire collection would weigh as much as an
adult elephant.  If these books were placed on a shipping palate,
10 by 10 and 100 books high, the tallest basketball players could
not see over the stack.


Thus 10,000 such books, stacked up
would be over 833 feet tall, higher than
the Washington Monument at 555 feet,
or the Hoover Dam at just over 730 feet,
917 feet high by the end of the year,
and 1,000 feet by March, 2004. . . .

Project Gutenberg DVD Needs Burners

So far we have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have
a DVD burner or know someone with one, please email me
so we can plan how many DVD's we can make with all 10,000
Project Gutenberg eBooks on them when they are ready.  We
can likely send you a box of CDs containing most of these
files early, and then a final update CD in November when
you would download the last month's/weeks' releases.

I have the first test 10K Special DVD here right now!!!
Nearly all of our first 10,000 eBooks, and multiple formats!


*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.  We have
regular needs for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby AT pglaf.org&gt; ,
if you can help.


*** Progress Report

[Disclaimer:  We have several people and programs who count
up the Project Gutenberg eBooks and help create the statistics
we provide.  Every once in a while these don't agree, and we
have numbers that slightly disagree, even as to the number of
weeks in a given year. . .for example, 2003 has 53 Wednesdays,
so we will have 53 Newsletters, and thus will count 53 weeks,
at least some of us will. . . .   ;-)   This week is unusual,
because we are in the process of reestablishing our databases
after reaching eBook #10,000 a few weeks ago, and the programs
are not yet back to running at full capacity.  Thus, we have
had several mere mortals counting up the books and disagreeing
on how many there are.  I counted 87, George counted 84, and
one day we didn't get any reports at all, so we could both be
somewhat off.  Hopefully next week we will get back to normal.]


    In the first 10.75 months of this year, we produced 3,800 new eBooks.

     It took us from 1971 to 2000 to produce our first 3,800 eBooks!

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot, by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file),
since the online database doesn't reflect recent additions.

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner
(note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will
not be returned). Alternatively, you can send your books directly to:

Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a you project you would like to work on.

*** Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???


Statistical Review

In the 47 weeks of this year, we have produced 3800 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 2002 to produce our FIRST 3800 eBooks!!!

         That's 47 WEEKS as Compared to ~31 YEARS!!!


With 10,565 eBooks online as of November 26, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.95 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.5% of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.56 when we had 6297 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing $.61 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 10,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

At 10,565 eBooks in 32 Years and 4.75 Months We Averaged
      326 Per Year   [We do more per than that month these days!]
       27 Per Month
      .89 Per Day

At 3,822 eBooks Done In The 329 Days Of 2003 We Averaged
     11.6 Per Day
     81.3 Per Week
    354.3 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 1st was
the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003 at noon.

This year there will be 53 Wednesdays, thus one extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


From Newsscan:

THE WIRELESS, THE SEEKERS, AND THE SORTERS
A new study by the Pew Internet & American Life Project has found that 27%
of teenagers and 20-somethings are considering abandoning their home phones in
favor using only their cell phones. Overall, 21% of cell phone users of all
ages
have considered canceling their home phone service, but as of now only 3% have
actually gotten rid of their fixed-line phones. The study also found that the
tech elite consists mostly of 30-somethings who spend an average of $169 a
month
on information goods.  Study author John Horrigan points out as a new paradox
the fact that those who consume more information technology are the least
likely
to report feeling overwhelmed by the volume of information: "They know how to
sort through that." (Washington Post 24 Nov 2003)
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8674-2003Nov23.html

VIRTUAL HIGH SCHOOL
The Michigan Virtual High School program has become the second-largest such
program in the country, with more than 7,200 student enrollments. The program
allows students to take courses over the Internet to earn credit for a variety
of classes not offered in their own schools. One student in the program says:
"It's not as hard as I thought it would be. You don't have to sit in a
classroom
and listen to teachers talk. I can only listen to a teacher for so long." Out
of
13 states with the program, Florida has the highest enrollment, with an
expected
20,000 student enrollments this school year. (AP/USA Today 23 Nov 2003)

PRAGUE: WHERE IT'S AT, INFORMATION-WISE
The Czech Republic is being increasingly seen by global corporations as an
excellent location for their customer call centers as well as back-office
and IT operations. DHL, the logistics group, will eventually be employing
1,000 people at a data center in Prague to track shipments, customer queries
and
billing activities throughout Europe, and Accenture, the consulting firm, plans
a five-fold increase in employees in Prague over the next five years, to 1,500
employees. The Los Angeles Times reports that whereas previously service
projects went to cheaper destinations such as India and the Philippines,
Western
companies now see central Europe as a viable alternative because it is closer
in
culture and time zone to companies' headquarters, and because it has a
better-qualified workforce, with a large pool of expatriates who can speak
multiple languages. (Los Angeles Times 24 Nov 2003)

CELLPHONE SWITCHING
About a hundred thousand cellphone users changed their wireless service
carriers yesterday, taking advantage of a new federal rule allowing
consumers to switch without penalty. However, the number of people making
the switch was far smaller than what had been predicted, and a Consumers
Union spokesperson said, "Our guess is today people may be taking it kind of
slow." People are now allowed to keep their phone numbers when they switch
wireless carriers or when they convert from fixed-line to wireless phone
service. (San Jose Mercury News 25 Nov 2003)

ANTI-SPAM BILL PASSES IN HOUSE, SENATE
The Senate passed a bill to curb junk commercial e-mail by voice vote on
Tuesday, and the House passed a similar measure on Saturday by a vote of
392 to 5. President Bush is expected to sign the legislation (known as the
"Can Spam" Act) once the two bills are reconciled. Many are skeptical.
California state Democrat senator Debra Bowen says, "The bill doesn't can
spam, it legalizes it. It's full of loopholes. It's difficult to enforce.
It's weaker than many state laws." And telecom attorney Charlie Kennedy
advised: "The best line of defense for consumers are the antispam filters
which are available commercially." (New York Times 26 Nov 2003)

FREE ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE FROM COMPUTER ASSOCIATES
Computer Associates (CA) announced this week it will make its eTrust EZ
Armor software--which includes virus protection and a personal
firewall--available at no charge to consumers in an effort to protect
corporate networks from the large number of unprotected home users.
CA's Ian Hameroff said that his company remains focused on corporate
customers but that threats increasingly come from home users. CA's
announcement sent the stock prices of competing antivirus companies
falling. Symantec's stock dropped seven percent, while that of Network
Associates fell five percent. At least one analyst said the reaction
was excessive, however. Donovan Gow of American Technology Research
noted that CA only holds six percent of the antivirus market worldwide
and just one percent of the consumer market. Hameroff said CA's
motivation in offering the software for free "was not to erode the
market share of our competitors."

Headline News Mostly Avoided By The Major U.S. Media

IF WE HAD A BOOMING ECONOMY IN THE 90'S, THEN WHY DID
THE BANKRUPTCY RATE DOUBLE IN THE LAST 10 YEARS?

Personal bankruptcies in the U.S. have doubled over
the past 10 years, pretty consistently, at a yearly
rate of increase of 7%.  This was true even during
the major economic boom period of the 1990s, and it
has recently increased to 8%, which means that at
the rate bankruptcies are doubling every 9 years.

According to a Harvard study, the major reason is
that the economic boom has only been paying any
returns to the upper crust, while the daily jobs
have been being shipped overseas, or merely just
downsized out of existence.

This has been getting media coverage only in the
off peak programs off the major media pathways.

***

Speaking of our major television anchors last week:

"Do you ever wonder why Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings
and even Jim Lehrer started reading off GDP statistics instead
of GNP numbers?"

Someone pointed out that the three major TV anchors are each
about twice as old as the US median age of 33. . . .

On the average they started as news anchors when Reagan was
just starting his first administration.


Name             Born  Ages               Anchor
Dan Rather       1931   72 and Anchor since 1981
Tom Brokaw       1940   63 and Anchor since 1982
Peter Jennings   1938   65 and Anchor since 1983
Jim Lehrer       1934   69 and Anchor since 1975
==========================================================
Average          1936   67 and Anchor since 1980


I've noticed that each of them is stuttering more now, but
I'm sure they'll all try to make it through the upcoming
presidential election, but their average age will be 72
by the one after that, and I'll bet they all go within
about the same number of years as they were hired. . . .

The real question is:  who will replace them?  And why?

What will be the criteria for the new news anchors?

If the new ones start today and are the same age as
these were when they started anchoring, they will
each have been born at an average date of 1959. . . .

It looks as if we will never have an era of anchors
who were developing in the 50's and 60's. . . .

We could go straight from those who developed in
the Great Depression and WWII, those we have now,
to those who came from the MBA and disco generation.

"NO BLOOD FOR DRUGS???"

Apparently Vioxx is over $100 a month in the U.S.
and $35 a month in Canada.

$27B in tax dollars spent on basic research in
the U.S. dollars, much of which benefits the
pharmaceutical industry, which they not only
don't pay for, but they don't pay tax dollars
on their own research or advertizing; says the
Chairman of the House Science Committee.  This
means the U.S. taxpayers pay three subsidies
to the pharmaceutical industry:

1.  By paying so much more for their products.

2.  By paying for most of the $27 of research above.

3.  Oof, sorry, I forgot the third one. . . .

KIDS RESTRAINTS MANDATED TO AGE 8 IN ILLINOIS

Kids who had graduated from car seats at age 5
are going back into their padded restraints
for another 3 years in Illinois.

I once did some research that indicated the
odds of a child being saved by one of these
was something quite minimal. . .way under 1%.

I don't like the idea of creating industries
mandated by goverment to protect against the
odds things that are less than 1% that takes
a billion dollars out of our pockets to give
it to someone such as Cosco, whose product
was denounced this week by the major media
as allowing kids to be tossed out onto the
highway in collisions as slow as 30 MPH.

I wonder if kids raised in car seats are
going to be severely underdeveloped.

***

My best friend just sent me this reply:

"Maximum Security is ALWAYS a Prison."

She works at a school where NO incidents
have EVER been reported, yet they will be
going to a high security system next spring
in which everyone has to have a badge on
and visible at all times, keyless entry
that works like a times bank vault. . .
we're just waiting for the schood day
when no one can get in at all. . . .

Of course, it does nothing to stop anyone
who just throws bricks through the window
and climbs in. . . .

Last, but not least. . .

ECONOMIC WARFARE ON THE MEDICAL FRONT

1.  Americans have been going to Canada
to buy their prescription drugs for half
as much as they pay here in the U.S.

2.  There are those who claim these drugs
are inferior to those bought in the U.S.

3.  These are the same drugs, often from
the same production lots they buy here,
filled from the same U.S. prescriptions.

4.  The drug companies nearly lobbied in
a law that would prevent this, or ordering
from Canadian drug stores over the Internet,
the phone, etc.

5.  Finally, the drug companies have stopped
or reduced shipping to Canadian drug stores
they suspect are selling to Americans.

6.  In response, the Illinois Governor,
Rod Blagojievich has said he will eliminate
as many of the products of these companies
as possible from the preferred list for
Illinois drug purchases.

7.  Those of you who have been reading this
Newsletter for some time may recall that I
predicted some kind of economic warfare on
the medical front.

It's not just free things like Naptster they
want to shut down, these drugs were paid for,
by all parties concerned.  It's just that the
U.S. wants to allow for non-competition to a
degree that even prevents the re-importation
of things made in the U.S.

Apparently some 60% of the price paid by U.S.
citizens for many prescriptions goes to the
bottom line, leaving only 40% to pay for the
research, advertising and salaries. . . .  I
heard that the drug companies are spending
twice as much on advertising than research
since the onslaught of TV ads that bypass
doctors and present products directly to
the public [which used to be illegal].
