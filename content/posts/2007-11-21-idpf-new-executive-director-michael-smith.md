<img src="/images/idpf_logo.gif" title="IDPF Logo" alt="IDPF Logo" align="left" height="72" width="176" /> New York, NY 11/20/07 – The International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF), the international trade and standards association for the eBook and digital publishing industry has named Michael Smith its new executive director. As executive director Michael Smith is responsible for leading the operational and strategic efforts of the IDPF and reports to its nine member Board of Directors. The IDPF (www.IDPF.org) is comprised of approximately 100 leading publishing, technology, and non-profit companies and organizations.

“Michael Smith brings to the IDPF over 20 years of book publishing and print production expertise,” stated Steve Potash, IDPF President and CEO of OverDrive, Inc. “Mr. Smith is well prepared to advance the interests of publishers, technologists, and readers by evangelizing the adoption of IDPF standards for electronic reading applications and products,” Potash added. Prior to joining the IDPF Mr. Smith was employed by Toronto based romance publisher Harlequin Enterprises Ltd. where he managed eBook and book production servicing North America, UK and Australian markets.

“It’s an exciting time in the evolution of electronic publishing to be devoting my energies to the mission of the IDPF,” said Michael Smith, Executive Director of the IDPF. “I look forward to working with the stakeholders in the IDPF community for the development of new standards, business and use models, and enhanced electronic reading experiences for consumers of all ages,” stated Mr. Smith.

Earlier this year the IDPF published its “.epub” file format standard, alleviating many of the previous file interoperability and production issues affecting the eBook industry and its customers. Several leading publishing and reading technology companies and organizations have already implemented .epub into their products and workflows.
