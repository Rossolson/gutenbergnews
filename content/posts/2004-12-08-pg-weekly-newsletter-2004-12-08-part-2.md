.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

&gt;From David Price, about #14240, Reviews, by Oscar Wilde:

For those interested: This is a collection of the various (mainly
literary) reviews that Oscar Wilde wrote during his career.  Robert Ross,
Wilde's friend and literary executor, put the collection together in 1908
and provides an introduction to the work.

~ ~ ~

&gt;From David Widger, regarding #14282, Properties of Shrowde Shrews and Honest
Wives, by Desiderius Erasmus:

Notes: This is from blackletter Englyshe dated 1557. One illustration is
included. The text version preserves the line breaks of the original, the
html version has been treated similar to drama and starts a new paragraph
for each change of speaker. One illustration of the title page is
included to illustrate the flavour of the original.

~ ~ ~

Compromise: the art of dividing a cake so that everybody believes he or
she got the biggest piece.
