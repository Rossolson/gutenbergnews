Borders is expanding its relationship with Sony, adding the technology company’s [e-book reader](https://www.gutenbergnews.org/20071003/sony-reader-digital-book-prs-505/ "Sony Reader (PRS-505)") to over 200 more of its superstores, while also agreeing to develop a co-branded store to facilitate e-book sales. Borders has been selling the Sony Reader in 270 of its superstore since last November and will now offer it for sale in more than 500 outlets. “We have been doing very well with it,” Borders spokesperson Anne Roman said of the Reader. The rollout to additional stores will begin in October.

Also starting next month, Borders will team with Sony to launch a new e-bookstore. Currently, e-book titles for the Reader can only be downloaded through Sony’s Connect online store. According to Roman, the co-branded site will have a separate URL from either the Borders or Sony sites when it launches, but the store will eventually become part of the retailer’s e-commerce site, Borders.com, when that goes live early next year.
