Weekly_July_13.txt
**The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, July 13, 2005 PT1**
*******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971******


Project Gutenberg of the Philippines is getting started, contact as below.


I am preparing this Newsletter a day early, based on a projected 65 eBooks,
as I expect to be called again for jury selection tomorrow. . .I am back on
lunch break, and will update the figures as best I can. . there seems to be
a discrepancy of 3 extras not counted, which might just balance out a three
that we counted twice last week.


Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com

Please note that we are still in the process of correcting our statistical
program data.  Last week we subtracted a few that we thought had been in a
duplicate count situation, but either that correction didn't stick or some
new similar problem has occured.  As always, the total count should be the
consideration of some attention as to possibly being off by a few eBooks.

Please note that PT2 of this Newsletter is currently in flux, as we shift
from to an automated PT2 sender.  The situation with Monthly Newsletters
is in flux to an even greater degree.  Our apologies as we make changes.

PROJECT GUTENBERG OF EUROPE TAKES OFF!!!

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE" STARTS REGULAR ACTIVITY

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]


This past month marked the official beginnings of our
new companion, Project Gutenberg of Europe with eBook
entries expected in over 100 languages.  In the first
month we have seen a total of 100 about eBooks and an
assortment of 65 articles in total, thus representing
62 Eurasian languages and dialects.  Volunteer effort
is totally responsible for these, and your assistance
to PGE would be greatly appreciated in creating eBook
titles from all of the ~120 languages and dialects in
which PGE hope to produce eBooks.


After a year of preparation "Project Gutenberg Europe", organized by
"Project Rastko Network" and its "Distributed Proofreaders Europe",
started regular activity last month, now having now its own server
provided by leading South Eastern European provider "EUnet".

PGE and its branches operate under European copyright legislation
(life+50 and life+70).

It already has volunteers all over the continent: European Community,
Comonwealth of Independent States [ex-USSR] and other countries.

"Distributed Proofreaders Europe"--as central European PD digitizing system,
and only Unicode is capable of that kind in the world at the moment--releases
a multilingual "European Proofing Package" of books this month, as special
choices of general interest for whole continent.

Also, regional and national campaigns in European countries were scheduled
between May 31 and June 30, including first wave of physical events--
conferences and promotions--in Eastern Europe (Macedonia, Serbia, etc).

[For details please email hart AT pglaf.org]

Darwin!!!

Would anyone like to work on reproofing our Darwin collection
and creating a compilation file as requested by our readers.

We could also use some help making some new editions of
"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes" and "Frankenstein."

v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

http://homepage.mac.com/ptwobrussell/podreader.html

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

REQUEST FOR RUSSIAN TRANSLATOR

We are trying to start up a Project Gutenberg Russian Team,
and we need someone to translate simple email messages from
members of Project Gutenberg who want to provide a service
to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,
we need them translated into English, also in a .doc file.
Thanks!!!     Contact Jared Buck  &lt;JBuck814366460@aol.com&gt;

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.


*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

CIA's Electronic Reading Room,      2,019 Reference Files
=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,453,652,151 that would be 16,694 x 64,536,522 = 1.07 Trillion !!!

With 16,694 eBooks online as of July 13, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.93 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,536,522 x 16,694 x $.93 = ~$1 trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 16,694 eBooks onli8e as of July 13, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.60 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.76 when we had 13,225 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 16,694 eBooks in 34 Years and 00.25 Months We Averaged
      ~490 Per Year
        40.8 Per Month
         1.34 Per Day

At 1738 eBooks Done In The 189 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
     9.2 Per Day
      64 Per Week
     278 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


IE LOSING FAVOR ON SOME CAMPUSES
Frustrated with ongoing concerns about the security of Microsoft's
Internet Explorer, IT staff on a number of campuses in the United
States have begun to encourage faculty and students to use other
browsers instead. In December, officials at Penn State started advising
users to opt for either Firefox or Opera. IT staff in the physics
department at the University of Florida have recently started urging
users to switch to Firefox, saying that all Windows users should
install the open source application and define it as the system's
default browser. The university-wide Office of Information Technology
at Florida now includes Firefox on a CD that is given free to all
students. The CD includes network software and antivirus tools and
previously offered IE and Netscape Navigator as browser choices.
Although the university does not officially endorse any browser, it
began adding Firefox to the CDs after many students and faculty had
asked about it, according to Marc I. Hoit, interim associate provost
for information technology. Alan Paller, director of research at the
SANS Institute, said that because of Firefox's security and
simplicity, he sees the move as beneficial, both for the schools and
their users as well as the Internet generally.

CHOOSING THE RIGHT COMPUTER FOR COLLEGE
Computer makers are gearing up for the back-to-school season with
packages targeting college students, though the choices included in
many of those packages differ from what campus IT departments would
prefer. This year's student-focused computer deals lean heavily on
multimedia tools and performance. Features such as DVD burners,
Microsoft's Windows Media Center Edition operating system, TV tuners,
and high-definition audio tools are common in this season's offerings.
Colleges and universities tend to be more conservative in their
computer specifications, however, preferring operating systems such as
Windows XP or Mac OS X, for example. Although few schools have strict
requirements for student computers, many have arrangements with
particular vendors that offer discounts on their systems. In terms of
design, laptops now represent a greater portion of computer sales than
desktops. Despite the price advantage of desktops, laptops are hard to
turn down for students going from building to building across campus.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

Novak still has to get prime mention. . .not to mention
his connection with White House Chief Karl Rove.



*STRANGE WORDS OF THE WEEK

Robert Novak, whose article "outed" CIA operative Valerie
Plame, was grilled on CNN last week, but still refuses to
even say if he as even been asked to testify in the case
that has now sent Judith Miller to jail for not revealing
her sources on a story she never even wrote.


Daniel Shorr comments:

"The public no longer respects what we do," referring to
journalists in general.  He reported that he felt "very
depressed" about the current situation, and mentioned a
public outcry on his behalf that helped save him from a
similar contempt charge in 1976, this time by a House
Committee, so it was "Contempt of Congress," when he was
refusing to reveal his sources when he revealed a secret
Congressional Report about the CIA.

"Today they would send me to jail without a murmer."

*

Judith Miller, herself, commented on CNN that this case
was not about the issues at hand but rather about "whether
there could be a Deep Throat today," a spectre she referred
to as being "positively Orwellian."  [1984, by Geo. Orwell]

*


DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

All that nonsensical rhetoric about Novak not being questioned,
followed by total silence when asked for current information.

Not to mention implying that reporters think they are above the law.


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Mark Felt [Watergate's Deep Throat] will be reported as to
have enjoyed the bottle of Champagne President Nixon sent
him after President Reagan pardoned him more than any other
public event of his entire lifetime.

[His assistance to Woodward and Bernstein [Washingto Post]
was crucial in forcing President Nixon out of office for
his role in the burglary of the Democratic National offices
house in the Watergate complex.  I have a feelling that the
book and movie "All the President's Men" might be selling
more copies right now.]

In addition, since Mark Felt's only superior officer at the
FBI, Director L. Patrick Gray, just died, we might expect a
few more details to come out about *his* Watergate connection.
Gray was also forced out of office due to his involvement,
but I don't think any formal charges were ever filed."

Concert attendence down 12% in 2005.

[I know this includes popular music, I don't know if it
includes all kinds of concerts]


*

50 million Americans live in various kinds "gated communites."

That means out of just a handful of people, one is most likely
living in such an "arranged community."

*

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.

POEM OF THE WEEK


The Demon of Poetry


poetry has become a demon
harrassment is its game
thoughts upon thoughts of
perfectly shaped fertile colorful rhymes
incessantly harrass my spirit
and then lose strength, meaning, and color
as soon as I grab my pen to pin them down
my thoughts, like caterpillars
my words, like butterflies
the mirror shows a wrinkled forehead
and dark, unrested eyes
