<pre>**The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, June 29, 2005 PT1**
*******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971******

Please note that this Newsletter is being prepared in advance so statistics
for the last few days of our production week are estimated based on 50.


Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com

Please note that we are still in the process of correcting our statistical
program data.  Last week we subtracted a few that we thought had been in a
duplicate count situation, but either that correction didn't stick or some
new similar problem has occured.  As always, the total count should be the
consideration of some attention as to possibly being off by a few eBooks.

Please note that PT2 of this Newsletter is currently in flux, as we shift
from to an automated PT2 sender.  The situation with Monthly Newsletters
is in flux to an even greater degree.  Our apologies as we make changes.

v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

REQUEST FOR RUSSIAN TRANSLATOR

We are trying to start up a Project Gutenberg Russian Team,
and we need someone to translate simple email messages from
members of Project Gutenberg who want to provide a service
to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,
we need them translated into English, also in a .doc file.
Thanks!!!     Contact Jared Buck  &lt;JBuck814366460@aol.com&gt;

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 16,560 eBooks online as of June 29, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.94 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,507,911 x 16,560 x $.94 = ~$1 trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 16,560 eBooks online as of June 29, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.60 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.76 when we had 13,106 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

SUN BROADENS OPEN SOURCE RELEASES
Just weeks after Sun Microsystems published the source code for its
Solaris operating system as an open source application, the company
announced it would also release the source code of its Java application
server software. Offering the two technologies as open source tools is
part of Sun's efforts to rebuild momentum and market share lost in the
collapse of the dot-com economy, which has hurt Sun more than
competitors including IBM, HP, and Dell. The Java language can be used
to develop applications that run on a variety of computers and other
electronic devices, such as cell phones. By moving the Java software to
open source, Sun hopes to broaden the number of developers working with
Java (already estimated at 4.5 million) and give the company a stronger
foothold in various markets. According to John Loiacono, head of Sun's
software group, making the source code for the Java application server
software available will help Sun sell "services, systems, storage, and
design services" to greater numbers of customers.

DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO CREATE VAST STUDENT DATABASE
Officials at the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) have proposed the
creation of a database containing information on virtually every
college student in the country, as well as many high school students.
Intended as a tool to aid recruitment efforts, the database would
include names, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, addresses, birth
dates, ethnicities, grade point averages, and other data. The DoD's
database bears similarities to another database proposed by the
Department of Education. That database would track individual students
through their college careers, providing a clearer picture of
graduation rates than current records, which track only aggregate rates
from institutions. The Education Department's proposed database has
drawn criticism from privacy advocates, who see it as a potential risk
to privacy. The DoD proposal has similarly elicited complaints from
groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC).
According to EPIC, the database would be a "bad idea," putting tools of
direct marketers in the hands of government officials but without
affording consumers the same protections from government that they
enjoy from marketers.

MICHIGAN SHARES GOOGLE CONTRACT

[We should be aware that the contract with the New York Public Library
never included copyrighted works, but only their public domain books.]

In an effort to address concerns that have arisen over Google's
project to digitize vast numbers of books from several libraries, the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor has made its contract with Google
available online. Google has entered into agreements with libraries at
Michigan, as well as Stanford University, Harvard University, the
University of Oxford, and the New York Public Library, to scan most or
all of their books, including those still protected by copyright. Books
in the public domain will be made available on the Web; for those under
copyright, only short excerpts will be online. Critics have contended
that simply making digital copies of copyrighted books is a violation
of copyright protections. The contract states that if either party
becomes aware of copyright infringement, it will be quickly addressed.
The contract also indicates that, aside from compensation for costs of
transporting books, the university will receive no money for its
participation in the project. John P. Wilkin, associate university
librarian at Michigan, said he hopes that by making the university's
contract publicly available, critics will see that there is nothing
sneaky going on between Google and the library.

ALA SAYS NEARLY ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES OFFER FREE INTERNET ACCESS

[I think there is an error in the first mention of 21 percent.
Perhaps the 1994 date should have been 1984.  Sent inquiry]

A study released this week by the American Library Association (ALA)
indicates that 98.9 percent of libraries in the United States offer
free Internet access, up from 95 percent in 2002 and just 21 percent in
1994. In addition, the study found that 18 percent of libraries offer
wireless access, with another 21 percent expecting to offer it within a
year. Rates of access, as well as bandwidth and the likelihood of
wireless access, were higher in urban than in rural parts of the
country. Nearly 40 percent of libraries use Web filters to prevent
minors from accessing adult content on library computers. Carol
Brey-Casiano, president of the ALA, commented that the availability of
Internet-connected computers at libraries could be one reason the
number of annual library visits has risen from about 500 million in the
early 1990s to 1.2 billion today.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


Zinmbabwe Passes Human Rights Bill Overshadowing US Rights


Yes, people in Zimbabwe now have rights even Americans don't!

They can assemble for protest marches without getting a permit!

Even though the United States Consitution guarantees people the
"right to assemble," and for "redress of grievances," the rights
were curtailed by the Nixon administration and never returned.

Of course, this isn't the only such example these days:

The UN wanted to send election monitors to the United States,
but the Bush II adminstration refused, they were already winning.

Amnesty International rates the United States as one of the most
problematic areas in the world in terms of human rights, torture
and other issues.

Eminent Domain, Paying Increases Taxes As Bribery Is
Ruled As Legal by the United States Supreme Court


Yes, this subject has been covered, but the subject of
taking the land for public use has NOT been covered as
having been converted to taking land for private use.

It's one thing to take someone's property against their will
to create highways, railroad, public water plants, etc.

It's quite another to take someone's property against their will
to build a luxury high rise, a McDonald's, a Disneyland, a mall,
or any other privately owned plainly commercial enterprise.

What only a few commentators have addressed is the fact that the
case is fundamentally a case legalizing the bribery of cities by
stating that the new owners will pay higher taxes than old ones.

What USED to be a bidding war between cities to GIVE TAX BREAKS
to corporations to get them to come to town, now, as companies
have become more powerful than cities, the companies now offer
TAX INCENTIVES to the cities as a bribe to encourage the cities
to give them access to land already owned my private citizens,
no matter how long they have owned the property.

Another fact left out of current reporting is that the practice
of using eminent domain for corporate projects did not start in
Connecticut or Indiana, but was going strong in Ohio beforehand.

Turkey As An EU Member:  It's About The Money, All Over Again


Again the commercial factor has been left out of all reporting,
and they expect you not to notice that Turkey is the gateway to
India and China as a trading route and thus bringing Turkey into
the EU would be highly profitable merely in terms of an enhanced
trade opportunity with these two giant new economies.

In addition, Turkey has one of the largest standing armies,
which will give the EU much more power to enforce its will.

Nike Is Falling Apart, It's Still About the Money

Remember when Michael Jordan was paid more by Nike than ALL
the workers who made ALL the Nike shoes?

Perhaps it is turning out that you really can't build solid
businesses on these kinds of practices.

Another Supreme Court Ruling Against Human Rights


The Supreme Court also ruled that the police could not be sued
for failure to enforce court restraining orders, even when
this results in the death of the people supposedly protected
by such restraining orders.

*




*STRANGE WORDS OF THE WEEK

Yet More Rights Rescinded by the United States Supreme Court


The case of the reporters involved in the story about Valerie
Plame, undercover agent for the CIA, whose cover was blown in
apparent retaliation against her husband by the Bush White House,
is now the stage for the undoing of confidentiality of the press
by the Supreme Court.

Two years after the event, even after the unprecedented naming
of a special prosecutor to find the person who leaked her name,
there has been no one brought to trial for this offense.

Even Robert Novak, whose article sparked the entire controversy,
as a result of Ms. Plame's name being leaked to him, is somehow
free of these legal entaglements, but Matthew Cooper of Time and
Judith Miller of The New York Times are instead being threatened
with jail if THEY don't tell who leaked the information, even if
Ms. Miller never wrote about it.

Somehow Novak, the direct user of the leaked information is now
off the hook, but others are being hooked in his place, and the
new Supreme Court decision has placed the entire free press of
the United States in jeopardy to protect this effort to place
blame on others than Robert Novak, the originator of the story.



DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK


I'm guessing the above stories are enough doublespeak for a week.

Especially when you consider that this kind of threat was not used
on Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post when they
broke the Watergate stories and refused to name "Deep Throat."

If the Nixon administration didn't try this strategy with Woodstein,
then why is the Bush II White House doing this to Cooper and Miller?


However, there is still more doublespeak that should be mentioned:


The Republicans are saying public media, PBS and NPR, are too political.

In a totally unrelated story:

Patricia S. Harrison, former chair of the Republican party, was slated
as the new head of The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, overseer of
funding for both PBS and NPR [The Public Broadcasting System and National
Public Radio].  Ms. Harrison apparently has no experience in the area of
public broadcasting whatsoever.

"This is a fatal blow to the historic political neutrality of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting," said Senator Frank Lautenberg.

The current head, also a Republican, has been reported as being
too soft on retaliation against people such as Bill Moyers, who,
a Conservative himself, once worked for President Lyndon Johnson,
who, although a Democrat, was such a Conservative that many recall
him as more of a Republican.  Of course, Bill Moyers no longer has
his NOW program on PBS, but that part is being ignored as he is
pillaged just as if he were still there.

*

And lastly, we heard Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice say:


"The fear of free choices can no longer justify the denial of liberty."

[So why no UN election monitors allowed into United States elections?]


"The day is coming when the promise of a fully free and democratic
world, once thought impossible, will also seem inevitable."

"When we talk about democracy, though, we are referring to governments
that protect certain basic rights for all their citizens -- among these,
the right to speak freely.  The right to associate.  The right to worship
as you wish.  The freedom to educate your children -- boys and girls.
And freedom from the midnight knock of the secret police."

[Not to mention those who were excommuniated for voting against Bush.]


"The day must come when the rule of law replaces emergency decrees."

[Not to mention "The War Against Terror."]


"Opposition groups must be free to assemble, and to participate,
and to speak to the media."

[Not to mention those who were invited to various Bush events,
but were arrested and removed when they wore anti-Bush T-shirts,
even though they had official invitations.]

"They must accept the rule of law, they must reject violence,
they must respect the standards of free elections. . . ."


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Matthew Cooper of Time and Judith Miller of The New York Times
will go to jail rather than divulge their sources, and Time and
the New York Times will stand behind them, and so will most of
the world press corps.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

50 million Americans live in various kinds "gated communites."

That means out of just a handful of people, one is most likely
living in such an "arranged community."

*

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.

POEM OF THE WEEK


So They Asked For

A poem on love is what they daily ask for
they demand it really, they call for it
honest people with honest views and honest desires
so here it goes from me to you overnight delivery
like a boomerang that will soon enough come back
and hit me right in the face, Bullseye, I'll holler
and it'll make the woods tremble
Then I'll laugh out loud ha ha without
embarrassment. I can't find my eye, where is my eye
This is getting really hilarious, Has anybody seen my eye
[I mean the inner eye you dummy]

If love is the product of society
of long hours of work
processing and searching data
digitalized internet-ized by our intelligentsia
on the context of our fruitful economy and
growing industry, I don't want to purchase
it at retail stores. Not wholesale either.
I don't want gallons of it, pounds of it,
boxes of it loads of it tons of it zillions of it
I don't want whole sets of emotions just like
I reject whole sets of ideologies
I want this stuff to be expensive - spiritwise
classy fancy dandy randy clever witty and pretty
no refunds policy no returns ever no money back guarantee
no 30 days to fool with it, mess with it, and bring it back
put it on the shelf ready for the next purchase
I don't want it merchandised labeled
marketed publicized on the isles of any store
I don't want it bought, priced up, redeemed
