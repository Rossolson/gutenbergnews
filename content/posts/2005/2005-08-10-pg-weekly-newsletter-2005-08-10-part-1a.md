The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter For Wednesday, Auguest 10, 2005 PT1
******eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since July 4, 1971******

Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com

Please note that we are still in the process of correcting our statistical
program data.  Last week we subtracted a few that we thought had been in a
duplicate count situation, but either that correction didn't stick or some
new similar problem has occured.  As always, the total count should be the
consideration of some attention as to possibly being off by a few eBooks.

Please note that PT2 of this Newsletter is currently in flux, as we shift
from to an automated PT2 sender.  The situation with Monthly Newsletters
is in flux to an even greater degree.  Our apologies as we make changes.

***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject

and

The PG bittorrent tracker is up and running.
Aaron Cannon has placed the CD and DVD there if anyone wants to test.
You can access it by visiting
http://snowy.arsc.alaska.edu:6969

***

Please checkout the various Project Gutenberg FAQs, etc. at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/about

We're building a team to read our eBooks into MP3 files
for the visually impaired and other audio book users.

Let us know if you'd like to join this group.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

***

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

*** PROJECT GUTENBERG IS SEEKING LEGAL BEAGLES

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.
We have regular need for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby AT pglaf.org&gt; ,
if you can help.

This is much more important than many of us realize!

=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,459,357,434 that would be 16,926 x 64,593,574 = 1.09 Trillion !!!

With 16,926 eBooks online as of August 10, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.91 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,593,574 x 16,926 x $.91 = ~$1 trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 16,926 eBooks online as of August 10, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.59 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.74 when we had 13,484 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 16,926 eBooks in 34 Years and 01.25 Months We Averaged
      ~496 Per Year
        41.4 Per Month
         1.36 Per Day

At 1970 eBooks Done In The 217 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
     9.1 Per Day
      64 Per Week
     272 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

However, I just this moment heard a news item that made me wonder a
bit more about the accuracy of the U.S. Census.  A "Special Census"
is taking place in Normal, Illinois, that is expected to count more
people, by a factor of 3,000 or 3,400, depending on which source.

45,386 was the population as per the 2000 Census, so 3,000 added to
this would be an increase of 6.6%, and 3,400 would be 7.5%, above a
possibly automatic increase of 5% as per the same terms above but I
presume this is in addition to previous adjustments.

Of course, we should consider that we would have to double figures,
perhaps to 15% from those above, if are considering the normal time
between censuses of 10 years, these are for 5 years' growth.

In previous news I heard about the U.S. Census, no mention was made
about the annexation of various nearly locations as a cause of this
normally unexpected growth, but it is mentioned at the site I found
on the subject of the current Special Census.

If annexation is the primary cause of such increases, country wide,
then we should not be expecting a huge rise in the 2010 Census, but
rather should expect something more along the norm.  However, if it
is not annexation, but more actual people on the average, then this
might be an indicator that the population of the U.S. may have seen
300 million go by some time ago.

For more details, see:  www.normal.org/WhatsNew/Census.htm


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


FCC DROPS TELECOM RULES ON NETWORK ACCESS

[Why do they say they can't tell if prices will change as a result?]

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has dropped regulations
that forced telephone companies to lease network access at
FCC-determined rates to rival providers of broadband services. Internet
service providers will have a year to transition from the current system.
Whether the change will affect prices and availability of DSL is not known,
since phone companies can profit by leasing their lines to rivals
and benefit from all increased DSL purchases by U.S. customers.
DSL service providers are more concerned by competition for broadband
customers from cable companies, which claim 56 percent of broadband
customers versus 36.5 percent for DSL, according to data from the FCC.

FBI ISSUES RFP FOR SENTINEL

[Carnivore Reincarnate?]

Following cancellation in March of the Trilogy program at the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which was meant to modernize the
agency's computer systems, the bureau has issued a request for
proposals for Sentinel, its next-generation information management
system. Submissions are due by fall, with a contract expected by the
end of the year. The FBI announced last week that it had deployed its
public key infrastructure, which is a prerequisite for Sentinel.

KANSAS SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON OWNERSHIP OF FACULTY WORK

[I suppose this would allow Kansas to censor evolution materials.]

The Kansas Supreme Court will evaluate an appellate court decision
giving public institutions in Kansas the right to claim ownership of
any faculty work, including books, with no negotiation on terms
required. The lower court treated faculty work as "work for hire" under
federal copyright law, classifying scholarly work as within the scope
of employment of a faculty member. The current policy, designed in
1998, allows faculty to keep their book rights and has a
revenue-sharing model for technology copyrights. Should the higher
court decide in favor of the board, the policy could be changed at
will. The case pits the Kansas Board of Regents against the Kansas
National Education Association.

KANSAS BOARD OKAYS EVOLUTION KNOCK
from CBS/Associated Press

The Kansas Board of Education voted 6-4 to include greater criticism of
evolution in its school science standards, but it decided to send the
standards to an outside academic for review before taking a final vote.

The Kansas school system was ridiculed around the country in 1999 when the
board deleted most references to evolution. The system later reversed
course, but the language favored by the board Tuesday comes from advocates
of intelligent design or creationism.

The belief, which many say is deeply tied to religious belief, holds that
some features of the natural world are best explained by an unspecified
intelligent cause. Evolution is a fundamental scientific theory that
species evolved over millions of years through natural selection.

SURVEY SHOWS MIXED IMPACT OF INTERNET ON STUDENTS
A survey conducted in May 2004 by Steve Jones, professor of
communciation at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Camille
Johnson-Yale, a graduate student in communication at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, determined that 42 percent of the
professors surveyed saw a decline in the quality of student work with
the advent of the Internet, while 22 percent noted an improvement.

[One might suspect a study in which declines outweighed unchanged,
and the unchanged was never mentioned.  42% decline 34% same 22% improve,
thus the majority were either unchanged or showed improvement]

However, a majority of respondents, 67 percent, indicated that the
Internet had improved their communication with students. The nationwide
survey of 2,316 faculty elicited a concern with student plagiarism, and
74 percent of respondents said they use the Internet or other tools to
detect plagiarism. The researchers have presented some of their
findings at academic conferences and have submitted their work to a
peer-reviewed academic journal.

CHINESE SEARCH ENGINE IPO TAKES OFF

[Remember the previous predictions about China?]

Chinese search engine company Baidu.com launched its initial public
offering (IPO) of shares Friday on the Nasdaq stock market. The stocks
were priced at $27, opened at $66, and rose to $122.54 by market close.
Investors in Baidu include Google and several Silicon Valley venture
capital firms. Baidu is the top search engine in China, followed by
Google, and there is speculation that Google might attempt to acquire
the company in the future.

UT TO RECEIVE $1.8 FROM BLACKBERRY
The maker of BlackBerry devices will pay the University of Texas System
$1.8 million to settle a patent-infringement case over technology that
allows users to enter text into telephone-style keypads. Under the
terms of the settlement, Research in Motion, based in Canada, will also
be granted a license to continue using the technology. Part of the
settlement will fund research at the UT Ssystem's Arlington campus,
where the technology was developed by George Kondraske, a professor of
electrical and biomedical engineering, and Adnan Shennib, who was a
graduate student when the technology was invented in 1987. The UT
System is pursuing similar charges against more than 40 other companies
for illegally using the patented technology. The university, which
earns between $11 and $14 million annually from royalties on patents it
holds, has recently hired a vice chancellor for research and technology
transfer and will soon appoint an associate vice chancellor to help
protect its patents.

COURT REJECTS APPLE DEAL WITH GEORGIA SCHOOLS
A Georgia court has issued a ruling that seemingly puts an end to a
deal between Apple Computer and the Cobb County School District to
provide as many as 63,000 iBook laptops to the district's teachers and
middle and high school students. Critics of the deal argued that the
school district did not adequately inform voters that a sales tax
increase passed in 2003 would be used to fund the laptop program. The
issue was taken to court, and the judge in the case agreed with the
plaintiffs. The school board held a meeting to discuss its options,
which might include appealing the ruling. For the moment, however, the
deal appears to be over. Kathie Johnstone, president of the school
board, said that providing a laptop to all of the district's students
"is no longer an option." Because district officials had promised
teachers computers before the sales tax ballot issue, teachers might
still receive laptops.

One more item from alternate sources

SCIENCE OF DNA
from The New York Times (Registration Required)

The sequence of deals, intrigue and lawsuits would not have raised an
eyebrow in the art world. But the target this time was a collection of
scientific papers from the early days of molecular biology, a set that
some scientists had hoped to buy for an archive at the Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory on Long Island.

Instead, it has been bought for several million dollars by J. Craig Venter,
the maverick biologist who forced the government to a draw in a race to
produce a draft sequence of the human genome.

The Jeremy Norman collection, as the papers are known, was put together
before the materials had any clear market value. Mr. Norman and Al Seckel,
two private collectors in California, started gathering the papers at a
time when some scientists were discarding their archives, and many
institutions had no interest in them.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


When Did The News People Become The News?

Something that no one will report is that the three major TV
networks spent more time talking about ABC's Peter Jennings'
death on Monday than they did reporting the actual news, for
their evening broadcasts.


*STRANGE WORDS OF THE WEEK

Peter Jennings never completed the 10th grade.


DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

Companies that mismanage their pension funds and then as their
governments to free them from responsibility are like children
who kill their parents and then "throw themselves on the mercy
of the court" and say the court must help them because they're
now orphans.

[I have heard several versions of this, but have no idea where
it was originally said, sorry.]


*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

People will accept the forced change to HDTV, even though it will
cost the country a fortune [100,000,000 sets at $1,000 each would
be 100 billion dollars] but by putting more and more "fine print"
and scrollbars on the screen, the television industry is making a
significant portion of the public dissatisfied with current TVs.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Allergies in the U.S. have doubled since 1970.
Asthma has doubled since 1980.

"Since 1980, the number of Americans suffering from asthma has doubled."

*

Apple's new iTunes site in Japan sold its first million singles in
just four days.

*

The error level accepted in the Chinese census is greater than the
level of the entire United States population.  [In fact I think it
might be double the US population]

*

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.

POEM OF THE WEEK

This is number one of a series of five poems from a volume named:

"Thoughts of My Exiled Self."

The motto for this poetry volume is,
"Upon this Word I shall build my life."

scattered wood shavings fallen feathers
waves of sand tossed on a toasty beach
undulating pattern shows my heart and eyes ensemble
riding on the high tide of beauty without boundaries
