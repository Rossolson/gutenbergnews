Newsletter editors needed! Please email hart@pobox.com or gbnewby@pglaf.org
Anyone who would care to get advance editions:  please email hart@pobox.com

Please note that we are still in the process of correcting our statistical
program data.  Last week we subtracted a few that we thought had been in a
duplicate count situation, but either that correction didn't stick or some
new similar problem has occured.  As always, the total count should be the
consideration of some attention as to possibly being off by a few eBooks.

Please note that PT2 of this Newsletter is currently in flux, as we shift
from to an automated PT2 sender.  The situation with Monthly Newsletters
is in flux to an even greater degree.  Our apologies as we make changes.

***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject

and

The PG bittorrent tracker is up and running.
Aaron Cannon has placed the CD and DVD there if anyone wants to test.
You can access it by visiting
http://snowy.arsc.alaska.edu:6969

Please checkout the various Project Gutenberg FAQs, etc. at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/about

We're building a team to read our eBooks into MP3 files
for the visually impaired and other audio book users.

Let us know if you'd like to join this group.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.
We have regular need for intellectual property legal advice

CIA's Electronic Reading Room,      2,019 Reference Files
=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,457,924,389 that would be 16,859 x 64,579,244 = 1.08 Trillion !!!

With 16,859 eBooks online as of August 3, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.92 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,579,244 x 16,859 x $.92 = ~$1 trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 16,859 eBooks online as of August 3, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.59 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.74 when we had 13,438 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 16,859 eBooks in 34 Years and 01.00 Months We Averaged
      ~495 Per Year
        41.2 Per Month
         1.35 Per Day

At 1903 eBooks Done In The 210 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
     9.1 Per Day
      63 Per Week
     276 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]


HP ENDS IPOD SALES
Executives at HP have put an end to a deal with Apple Computer under
which iPod music players were available as HP-branded devices. Although
the deal was first announced in January 2004, the first models were not
available from HP until the fall of 2004, and sales of HP iPods
accounted for just 5 percent of iPod sales on average. According to an
HP spokesperson, the company remains committed to a strategy of digital
entertainment, but "reselling the iPod does not fit within that
strategy." Under the terms of the original agreement, HP will continue
to provide support for the iPods it has sold, and HP is not allowed to
market a competing digital music player until August 2006. HP expects
its current inventory of iPods, iPod Minis, and iPod Shuffles will last
through the end of September. The company will continue to sell other
digital-entertainment products, such as televisions and Media Center PCs.

PRINCETON DEBUTS UNIVERSITY CHANNEL
Princeton University has launched the University Channel, an online
repository of video footage of academic lectures. The service serves as
a central location for finding lectures and presentations from colleges
and universities that submit materials. Donna Liu, executive director
of the project, noted that although some institutions provide Webcasts
of important lectures, frequently tapings of lectures are purely for
archival purposes and cannot be easily located or viewed later. The
focus of the channel initially will be lectures on public policy and
international affairs, and several institutions have already submitted
content for the site. Topics might be expanded in the future. The
University Channel is also working with cable companies to broadcast
some of the lectures over cable networks. The new channel is similar in
concept to a project at the University of Washington called the
Research Channel, which focuses on scientific and medical research.

BROADENING THE SCOPE OF FREE COURSEWARE
Rice University's Connexions project is an effort to take the idea of
free educational materials to a new level. Started in 1999 by Richard
Baraniuk, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Rice,
Connexions is not unlike MIT's OpenCourseWare project, which puts
course materials from all MIT classes online for free. In contrast,
Connexions takes the approach of aggregating course materials from
professors at any school. Connexions also offers feedback tools that
allow users to rate content, similar to rating systems on sites such as
Amazon.com. In Connexions, ratings happen after publication, rather
than before publication as in traditional peer review, but Baraniuk
believes the rating system can provide an alternative to traditional
peer review, a system Baraniuk believes is broken. Baraniuk also sees
enormous potential in Connexions to help community colleges, which rely
heavily on adjunct professors who often have little time for course
development. With relatively limited resources, faculty at community
colleges could use Connexions to create courses tailored for their
institution and students, rather than the common practice of simply
having to rely on a single textbook for material.

CISCO AND SECURITY RESEARCHER AGREE TO DISAGREE
Security researcher Michael Lynn and Cisco Systems have reached an
agreement that should put an end to Cisco's legal action against Lynn
for speaking publicly about a flaw in the company's router software.
Lynn, who until Wednesday was employed by Internet Security Systems
(ISS), gave a presentation at the Black Hat Conference discussing the
vulnerability. Cisco and ISS had discouraged Lynn from giving the
presentation, saying that a patch had been issued for the flaw. Lynn
believed Cisco had not been open with consumers about the severity of
the problem, and he resigned from ISS to protest the company's
position that he should not give the presentation. After he left ISS,
however, Lynn faced legal action from Cisco, which argued that he had
no right to make the presentation since he was no longer employed by
ISS. Under the agreement, Lynn will stop disclosing information about
the flaw, and the legal action will be canceled. Computer security
expert Bruce Schneier applauded Lynn for his conviction in exposing
what he thought was a serious flaw despite the risks of going public.
Matt Bishop, professor of computer science at the University of California-
Davis, said he sees the practice of exposing flaws publicly as a dangerous
practice and that working with the affected vendor is preferable.

CONGRESS GETS SERIOUS ABOUT DATA PRIVACY
Ahead of its August recess, Congress moved data-security measures to
the top of its agenda, with various House and Senate committees
considering three different bills dealing with the protection of
sensitive information. The broadest legislation being considered is the
Personal Data Privacy and Security Act, which would place new
restrictions on how personal information may be used and imposes
criminal penalties for those found to have violated it. The bill would
limit the sale and publication of Social Security numbers, require
notification of consumers in the event their personal data is
compromised, and restrict the authority of the states in writing their
own regulations for data protection. Other bills working their way
through the Senate include similar requirements that consumers be
notified of data breaches, but they only include civil penalties. The
other measures, including one passed by the Senate Commerce Committee,
place oversight and enforcement authority with the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC). Critics of the proposed legislation argue that it is
being rushed through without proper discussion.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

Hurricanes growing 50%v fiercer due to global warming

Hurricanes have grown significantly more powerful and destructive
over the last three decades due in part to global warming,
MIT professor, Kerry Emanuel, who warns in the journal Nature
that this trend could continue.

Both the number of days per hurricane and their highest wind speeds
have increased by ~50 percent over the last 50 years.

Announced last week: Sony Music, now known as Sony/BMG,
will pay a $10 million settlement as per New York's Attorney
General, Eliot Spitzer.

Memos released in this investigation:

"Please be advised that in this week's Jennifer Lopez Top 40 Spin
Increase of 236 we bought 63 spins at a cost of $3,600."

"Please be advised that in this week's Good Charlotte Top 40 Spin
Increase of 61 we bought approximately 250 spins at a cost of $17K"

The names were embargoed, but everyone seem to know who they were.

Karl Rove and Robert Novak, whose comments "outed" CIA
operative Valerie Plame, managed to get off the hot seat
at the expense of Bush's unilateral appointment of now
Ambassador Bolton to the United Nations, but Judith Miller
still languished in jail for not revealing sources for the
story she never wrote.

For those who don't remember, you might recognize Bolton
if you look closely as a key player in stopping election
recounts in the first Bush election.

Of course, no one would ever mention such a thing, nor a
similar case, in which Judge Bork was nominated to the
Supreme Court without any mention of his being the "author
of the Saturday Night Massacre" of Watergate fame in which
no Attorney General or nominee would fire the prosector,
and we went through quite a few that night before Bork was
willing to do the dirty work to get the position.



*STRANGE WORDS OF THE WEEK

Walter McCormick, Jr, President and CEO, United States Telecom Assn,
is criticizing municipal wireless links to the Internet as being too
competitive with the businesses of the members of his association.

I wonder if automobile and gasoline manufacturers should get on the
bandwagon and criticize cities for allowing taxis, busses, trains,
and subway systems to compete, thus reducing sales of cars and gas?



DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK


Africa Should Be Self-Sustaining After We Pillaged Rain Forests

The information has been hidden for so long that even the
Africans seem to have forgotten that the reason for droughts
has been the cutting down of the rain forests at the behest
of the white world for more exports of lumber and wood products.

If you don't understand how rain forests work, just take a look
at the early NASA pictures of Africa and you can see the clouds
that form over rain forests after the rains, and then are blown
further to provide rains to other downwind areas.

When the rain forests disappeared, so did the rain, and clearly
show with the aid of NASA photographs from before rain forests
had been eliminated as an African environmental control system.

By the way, no one seems to have learned from this, rain forests
are continually being cut down around the world, and more drought
is expected, just keep watching the news and try to remember.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Now that Novak and Rove are off the hot seat, will they consider
releasing Judith Miller from jail while no one is looking?


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

Still Watching China and India

In the first half of the year Macao's [China] exports dropped
27% while imports rose 3.8%, suggesting the first possibility
that China's import-export ratio may have peaked.  The cause
of the export drop is largely due to the fact that Macao's
exports are largely in textiles, which have been very volatile
as per various international trade agreements recently.


The UK Office of National Statistics announced that it will be
outsourcing a major portion of Britain's population database
to India via a 3 year contract with Siemens.

Several sources have expressed worry concerning identity theft
at the source and say the savings from outsourcing are not in
line with the risks to passport holders and others.

Of course, the World Trade Organization approves of the deal.

Project Director, Carrie Armitage, from The UK Office of National
Statistics said in a prepared statement:

"It is essential to create new solutions to save time and money
and give better service to the public, particularly as there is
a growing number of applications for certificates."

[The number of deaths from medical errors in the US is
more than the number of deaths from automobile accidents!
Why no big movement to save THOSE lives?]

[Edupage synopsis]

NEW LAW ESTABLISHES DATABASES OF MEDICAL ERRORS
A bill signed into law last week mandates the creation of a network of
databases that store anonymous information on medical errors. According
to a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine, medical errors cost the
lives of 98,000 people in the United States each year. Sharing
information about those errors is seen by many as a useful step toward
preventing similar errors in the future, but many health care providers
have been reluctant to share such information for fear of litigation.
To that end, the databases mandated by the Patient Safety and Quality
Improvement Act of 2005 will strip identifying information regarding
patients and providers. Reporting information to the databases will be
voluntary, and backers of the measure hope that the anonymity provision
will encourage providers to submit details of medical errors, allowing
others to learn from their mistakes. Dr. J. Edward Hill, president of
the American Medical Association, called the new law "the catalyst we
need to transform the current culture of blame and punishment into one
of open communication and prevention."

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.

POEM OF THE WEEK

This is number one of a series of five poems from a volume named:

"Thoughts of My Exiled Self."

The motto for this poetry volume is,
"Upon this Word I shall build my life."

scattered wood shavings fallen feathers
waves of sand tossed on a toasty beach
undulating pattern shows my heart and eyes ensemble
riding on the high tide of beauty without boundaries
