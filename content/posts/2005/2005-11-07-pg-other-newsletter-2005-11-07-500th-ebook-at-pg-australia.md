*Project Gutenberg of Australia Celebrates the Posting of Its 500th ebook*


In a joint issue with Project Gutenberg (http://gutenberg.org/),
Project Gutenberg of Australia (http://gutenberg.net.au) is
celebrating the release of its 500th ebook,

'The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea' by George Collingridge.

The accumulation of 500 freely available ebooks since the inception
of Project Gutenberg of Australia in August 2001 represents the work
of many volunteers.

There are, of course, other books on Australian History but the present
title is an appropriate one to mark the release our 500th ebook as 2006 is
the 400th anniversary of the beginning of Australia's documented history.
In 1606 Willem Janszoon (aka Jansz.) charted some of the west coast of
the Cape York Peninsula and made the first authenticated landing on
Australian soil.

A number of events are being organised to commemorate the occasion by
"Australia on the Map: 1606-2006" (http://www.australiaonthemap.org.au/).

Collingridge's book narrates the Portuguese and Spanish discoveries in the
Australasian regions, between the years 1492-1606, with descriptions of
their old charts.

The work of Project Gutenberg in providing free ebooks is well known.
Less appreciated sometimes is the role it plays in preserving books
which might otherwise be "lost" and in making available titles which
it would not be commercially viable to republish. 'The First Discovery
of Australia and New Guinea' has, of course, been superseded by works
which have the advantage of later research. However, it is often desirable
to be able to read history from the perspective of earlier historians.

'The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea' by George Collingridge
may be found at both Project Gutenberg and Project Gutenberg of Australia.
