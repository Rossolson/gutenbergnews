v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

REQUEST FOR RUSSIAN TRANSLATOR

We are trying to start up a Project Gutenberg Russian Team,
and we need someone to translate simple email messages from
members of Project Gutenberg who want to provide a service
to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,
we need them translated into English, also in a .doc file.
Thanks!!!     Contact Jared Buck  &lt;JBuck814366460@aol.com&gt;

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.


*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

CIA's Electronic Reading Room,      2,019 Reference Files
=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 16,159 eBooks online as of May 04, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.96 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,394,041 x 16,159 x $.96 = ~$1 trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 16,159 eBooks online as of May 04, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.62 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.79 when we had 12,581 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 16,159 eBooks in 33 Years and 10.00 Months We Averaged
      ~478 Per Year
        39.8 Per Month
         1.31 Per Day

At 1203 eBooks Done In The 119 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      10.11 Per Day
      71 Per Week
     301 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

PROPOSED DATABASE WORRIES SECURITY EXPERTS
Amid a rash of corporate and institutional data breaches recently,
security experts are questioning whether a "unit record" database
proposed by the Department of Education could be kept secure. Currently
the department collects aggregate data on college students and
graduation rates. A unit record database would track individual
students through their college careers, presenting what some see as an
extremely tempting target for hackers. The current system would force a
hacker to "compromise several databases," according to Eugene Spafford,
professor of computer sciences and electrical and computer engineering
at Purdue University, whereas with a database like the one proposed,
"it's possible to attack it from any point in the system." Barbara
Simons, former president of the Association for Computing Machinery,
was also concerned about a unit record database, suggesting that it
might not be the safest way to accomplish the department's goals.
Grover Whitehurst, director of the Institute of Education Sciences at
the Education Department, said the agency is investigating security
options for the proposed database and welcomes suggestions. He noted
that the system might not use Social Security numbers as identifiers
and said that if the information in the system were limited in scope,
it would not be very appealing to hackers.

TIME WARNER REPORTS DATA LOSS
A company that handles data storage for Time Warner lost tape backups
containing personal information for about 600,000 employees. Iron
Mountain Inc., based in Boston, reportedly lost the tapes during
transport. Officials from Time Warner said the tapes did not contain
customer information. In a statement, Larry Cockell, chief security
officer at Time Warner, said that although no evidence exists that the
data have been accessed or misused, "we are providing current and
former employees with resources to monitor their credit reports while
our investigation continues." Time Warner owns America Online, HBO, and
Warner Brothers.

HEARINGS FOCUS ON LIBRARY PROVISIONS OF USA PATRIOT ACT
Amid both House and Senate hearings on whether to renew certain
portions of the USA PATRIOT Act, supporters and critics of Section 215,
which authorizes law enforcement to obtain records from libraries and
other institutions, have lined up to voice their opinions. Section 215
allows gaining access to various types of records with only the
approval of a secret court. Further, those whose information has been
collected are barred from disclosing that fact, even to attorneys.
Representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has
been highly critical of the legislation, said they could support its
renewal if several concessions were made, including limiting the
authority to investigate only "agent[s] of a foreign power" and
eliminating the gag order for those under investigation. Groups
including the American Library Association said they supported the
ACLU's recommendations. Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.) defended the law as
it stands, saying there has been much "misinformation" about Section
215 and how it has been used. Kenneth L. Wainstein, U.S. attorney for
the District of Columbia, said that the law has not been used to obtain
records from libraries, though he acknowledged that it could be used
that way in the future.

FIU SUFFERS COMPUTER HACK
Officials at Florida International University (FIU) are warning faculty
and students about possible identity theft after it was discovered that
a hacker had user names and passwords for 165 computers on campus.
Although only a few of the computers contained personal information,
and despite the fact that no evidence exists that anyone's information
has been misused, school officials fear that the hacker may have had
enough access to put the university's entire network in question.
University staff have been instructed to inspect 3,000 computers on
campus to determine if they have been compromised. FIU has recommended
that faculty and students remove any personal information from their
computers and that they monitor their credit cards for suspicious
activity that could indicate fraud.

U.S. STRENGTHENS COPYRIGHT LAW
President Bush this week signed into law the Family Entertainment and
Copyright Act, which allows for stiffer penalties for copyright
violations. Under the law, individuals found guilty of possessing one
or more copyrighted movie, music, or software files that have not been
released to the public face a fine and prison term of up to three
years. The law also criminalizes using a camcorder to record movies in
theaters. Copyright holders supported the measure. Dan Glickman of the
Motion Picture Association of America thanked Congress for what he
called "their strong advocacy for intellectual property rights."
Although some consumer groups opposed the law, some observers described
it as a relatively minor expansion of existing law. Eric Goldman,
professor of copyright law at Marquette University Law School, said he
expects the Justice Department to use its new authority responsibly.

SPITZER FILES SUIT AGAINST MARKETING FIRM FOR SPYWARE
New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has filed suit against
California-based Intermix Media for installing spyware on millions of
computers. The marketing company, which conceded that previous owners
indeed distributed spyware, is accused of violating state laws
concerning false advertising, deceptive business practices, and
trespassing. The state is seeking injunctions barring the company from
distributing any more spyware; an accounting of revenues the company
realized from the spyware; and fines of $500 for each act of installing
spyware. A statement from the company said that it voluntarily stopped
installing spyware recently and that no personal information was ever
collected with the secretly installed software. The statement hinted at
trying to reach a settlement with New York, a resolution that observers
said is a typical outcome of situations like this one.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

Bill Gates and Thomas Friedman on the subject of the
U.S. high school system.


*STRANGE QUOTE OF THE WEEK

"I don't know what the future holds,
but I do know who holds the future."


DOUBLESPEAK OF THE DAY

In the bombing of the Toykyo, Japan area the vast majority
of U.S. bombing runs were total disasters with very heavy
losses and most of the bombs missing their targets, but it
was never reported at the time.  Curtis LeMay, commander
of these air raids, was later promoted from Lt. Colonel
to Major General in just 18 months and even became the
Air Force Chief of Staff.  However, he pursued failure
after failure in that office, and, finally, after his
abortive candidacy for Vice President under segregationist
George Wallace, his career in the public eye was over.

In his favor, however, was his stance against the gradual
buildup to U.S. involvement in Viet Nam, but he was once
again ignored.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

The New York Stock Exchange will remain steady, not moving
much more than 5% above and below 10,500.



*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

20% of U.S. adults have completed 4 years or more of higher education,
which is 1 out of 5.  40 years ago college was more exclusive, as only
1 out of 7 had a college education.  Even with this influx of moderate
students, the grade average has increased, yet the SAT and ACT college
test scores continued to decline though the same period, at least from
then up to the point where the tests were rescored to make things look
as if they were not so bad.  However, when such testing was initiated,
it was for an even wider portion of the U.S. population, servicemen of
the World War Two era.

*

You've probably seen something like this statistic:

"A billion dollars ago was only 8 hours and 20 minutes,
at the rate Washington spends it."


Then:

"This may have been true a half a billion seconds ago, too,
but now they're spending faster, so it doesn't take so long.
It's less than five hours."


And lately:


"It's 3 hours, 30 minutes now, for the feds to spend a billion USD,
not counting some off-budget expenditures."

*

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
