***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

*

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

***

Please use our new site for downloading DVD and CD images, etc.

http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject

and

The PG bittorrent tracker is up and running.
Aaron Cannon has placed the CD and DVD there if anyone wants to test.
You can access it by visiting
http://snowy.arsc.alaska.edu:6969

Please checkout the various Project Gutenberg FAQs, etc. at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/about

We're building a team to read our eBooks into MP3 files
for the visually impaired and other audio book users.

Let us know if you'd like to join this group.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

***

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics
depicting Project Gutenberg themes, please contribute them!

To see some of what we have now, please see:

Project Gutenberg is seeking (volunteer) lawyers.
We have regular need for intellectual property legal advice
(both US and international) and other areas.  Please email
Project Gutenberg's CEO, Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby AT pglaf.org&gt; ,
if you can help.

This is much more important than many of us realize!

=======Grand Total Files=========~137,142 Total Files=====

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                   ~34,286 Unique eBooks

***

Please also note that over 23,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 5,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

*** Permanent Requests For Assistance:


DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES


Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

1.1 Trillion eBooks Given Away

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,462,207,246 that would be 17,020 x 64,622,072 = ~1.1 Trillion !!!

With 16,960 eBooks online as of August 24, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.91 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,622,072 x 17,020 x $.91 = ~$1 Trillion]
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]

With 17,020 eBooks online as of August 24, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.59 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.73 when we had 13,611 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 17,020 eBooks in 34 Years and 01.75 Months We Averaged
      ~498 Per Year
        41.5 Per Month
         1.36 Per Day

At 2064 eBooks Done In The 231 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
     8.9 Per Day
      63 Per Week
     266 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

However, I just this moment heard a news item that made me wonder a
bit more about the accuracy of the U.S. Census.  A "Special Census"
is taking place in Normal, Illinois, that is expected to count more
people, by a factor of 3,000 or 3,400, depending on which source.

45,386 was the population as per the 2000 Census, so 3,000 added to
this would be an increase of 6.6%, and 3,400 would be 7.5%, above a
possibly automatic increase of 5% as per the same terms above but I
presume this is in addition to previous adjustments.

Of course, we should consider that we would have to double figures,
perhaps to 15% from those above, if are considering the normal time
between censuses of 10 years, these are for 5 years' growth.

In previous news I heard about the U.S. Census, no mention was made
about the annexation of various nearly locations as a cause of this
normally unexpected growth, but it is mentioned at the site I found
on the subject of the current Special Census.

If annexation is the primary cause of such increases, country wide,
then we should not be expecting a huge rise in the 2010 Census, but
rather should expect something more along the norm.  However, if it
is not annexation, but more actual people on the average, then this
might be an indicator that the population of the U.S. may have seen
300 million go by some time ago.

For more details, see:  www.normal.org/WhatsNew/Census.htm


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

*Headline News from Edupage

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

ARIZONA HIGH SCHOOL DROPS TEXTBOOKS FOR IBOOKS
Trading printed textbooks for electronic texts, Empire High School in
Arizona issued iBook laptops to all of its 340 students when they
started the fall semester. Empire High is a new school, conceived as
one that does not use printed textbooks, though it does include a
library with printed books. According to Calvin Baker, the
superintendent of the Vail Unified School District, which includes
Empire, the idea was to move technology from being an add-on component
of education to a central role. In addition to having no printed
textbooks, the school incorporates technology deeply into the
curriculum and the design of the facility, which features a school-wide
wireless network. Balancing the risks introduced by such technology,
the school's network uses a central filter to control inappropriate
downloads or distracting applications such as chats and instant
messaging. Homework assignments submitted by computer are checked by
another application against published material and against other
students' work for plagiarism.

WARNER MUSIC GROUP CREATES E-LABEL

Warner Music Group plans to launch an online business model called an
e-label that will use digital downloads rather than compact discs to
distribute music. Artists will release music in groups of three songs
every few months rather than a CD every few years. Artists who sign
with the e-label will also retain copyright and ownership of their
master recordings. According to the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry, about 180 million songs were sold online in the
first half of 2005 compared to 57 million in the first half of 2004.
In addition, Apple Computer's iTunes service recently exceeded 500
million downloads.

[Please note:  this still requires the likely purchase of two songs
you don't want for every song you do want, and thus I predict will
not fly as well as the single song download model now in practice.
By the way, I think Warner and co. are well aware of this, and have
some hopes of actually getting away with it.]


[On a similar note, it would appear that SUN Microsystems is trying
their own co-optation route to change the Open Source Movement. . .]

SUN PUSHES OPEN SOURCE DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
Sun Microsystems announced the Open Media Commons initiative in an
effort to rally support behind an open source standard for digital
rights management (DRM). The company is releasing code from the Project
DReaM (DRM/everywhere available) program under the open source
Community Development and Distribution License. The initiative involves
developing a device-independent DRM standard called DRM Opera and
user-based (versus device-based) licensing.

VENDORS SUPPORT COMMUNITY WIRELESS PROJECTS

[In spite of the legal pressures companies who want commercial monopoly]

High-tech companies led by Intel joined in an international effort to
support wireless technology and applications for governments and
communities. The Digital Communities initiative supports 13 communities
that are desiging, developing, and deploying Wi-Fi, mesh, or other
wireless networks and applications. In the United States, Portland,
Oregon; Corpus Christi, Texas; Philadelphia, and Cleveland are
participants. Applications include support for municipal inspections
and repair, law enforcement, and emergency response. Taipei, Taiwan,
and Jerusalem, Israel, will also test Wi-Max.

WI-FI INITIATIVE SUPPORTS MUNICIPAL NETWORKS
A group of leading technology companies has started a program to offer
cities resources and discounts to encourage development of wireless
networks, both for city services and for residents. The "Digital
Communities" program is supported by Intel, Cisco, Dell, and IBM, among
others, and more than a dozen cities around the world are currently
participating. Organizers of the program believe that wireless
municipal networks have the potential to improve services and save
money in areas including emergency responders, such as firefighters and
police, and civil servants, such as meter readers and building
inspectors. Beyond city services, wireless networks allow cities to
provide Internet access to all of their citizens, including poor and
otherwise underserved communities, argue supporters. In addition to
saving money over other communication systems for city workers, the
networks can create revenue for cities that choose to charge for
Internet access. Taipei, Taiwan, one of the cities involved in the
program, is planning to use the network to create an online university
program for its 2.63 million residents.

NSF GRANT FUNDS STUDY OF ELECTRONIC VOTING
A team of researchers will use a five-year, $7.5 million grant from the
National Science Foundation (NSF) to study electronic voting. The grant
will support a research center called ACCURATE, A Center for Correct,
Usable, Reliable, Auditable, and Transparent Elections. Based at Johns
Hopkins University, the center includes researchers from the University
of California, Berkeley; Stanford University; Rice University; the
University of Iowa; and California-based research firm SRI
International. According to Dan Wallach, associate professor of
computer science at Rice, "The basic question is, 'How can we employ
computer systems as trustworthy election systems when we know computers
are not totally reliable, totally secure, or bug-free?'" The ACCURATE
project is expected to produce technical standards for electronic
voting and to develop secure voting systems that are easy to use.

BONES REVEAL FIRST SHOE-WEARERS
from BBC News Online

Sturdy shoes first came into widespread use between 40,000 and 26,000 years
ago, according to a US scientist.

Humans' small toes became weaker during this time,
says physical anthropologist Erik Trinkaus,
who has studied scores of early human foot bones.

He attributes this anatomical change to the invention of rugged shoes,
that reduced our need for strong, flexible toes to grip and balance.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA

A new terabyte DVD recorder unit was announced today by
Japanese Hitachi, LTD for about $2,500 [230,000 yen].

Before you get TOO excited, it is really TWO recorders
in one box, but it can simultanously record two HDTV shows.

Another reason not to get too excited, unless you are in
Japan, is that they will be mostly available only there,
at least in the current marketing plan.

However, presuming that you will be able to get one,
you could then copy virtually every word in any of the
major libraries of the world on a handful of these DVDs.

*STRANGE WORDS OF THE WEEK

The public domain is worthless, because anything over
45 years old is worthless, and copyright is 95 years.



DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

Iraq is not another Viet Nam.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

China will continue bidding for, and buying, more and more
of the world's infrastructure, to the sad detriment of U.S.
Congress' inability to veto purchases in other countries.

[This has obviously been continuing this week, and likely
will become an ongoing event for the next decade or two:
the real question is will the media give the full story?]


*QUOTE OF THE WEEK

US spending on tutors rose to $4 billion is 2004 from $3.4 billion in 2003.

[This is enough for 4 million families each to spend $1,000 per year,
just on extra tutoring to augment our failing classroom instruction.]

*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

In Rio de Janeiro over 1,000 people are killed each year by police.

[This reported in response to the reporting of the single person
killed by London police as a suspected terrorist bomber.]

Source:  NPR, via WILL-AM, ~9:20AM today

In related news, the British Home Secretary announced the "grounds"
for deportation on the basis of unBritish behaviour, but experts on
the UK legal system say these "laws," not passed by Parliament will
never stand up in the courts [and thus are nothing more than "scare
tactics" aimed at fear mongering among the general population].

LaSalle county, Illinois, is reporting the driest summer since 1936,
of the infamous "Dust Bowl" era.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.

POEM OF THE WEEK

This is number four of a series of five poems from a volume named:

"Thoughts of My Exiled Self."

The motto for this poetry volume is,
"Upon this Word I shall build my life."


On The Seventh Day

On the seventh day,
let your soul light up your eyes
like two candles in the Easter night,
like a lighthouse in the middle of the ocean
where feelings swim, and hope floats.
