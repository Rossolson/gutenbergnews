HOT REQUESTS

Darwin!!!

Would anyone like to work on reproofing our Darwin collection
and creating a compilation file as requested by our readers.

***

I was just wondering if you or might know someone from PG
who could help a Linux newbie like me.  There are some programs
I want to install, but I need step-by-step guidance to ensure
the programs compile correctly and so forth.

HEADLINE NEWS

Project Gutenberg of Canada needs your help!

Please email:

pgcanada@lists.pglaf.org

*

v0.2 version of PodReader is out, and it interfaces to PG.  This allows
users to browse the catalog on their Desktop, pick a book, and have it
downloaded to their iPod in the correct format...this is a good plus for
PG users since it makes it a lot easier to get to PG documents.

http://homepage.mac.com/ptwobrussell/podreader.html

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

REQUEST FOR RUSSIAN TRANSLATOR

We are trying to start up a Project Gutenberg Russian Team,
and we need someone to translate simple email messages from
members of Project Gutenberg who want to provide a service
to the Russian Team, but who do not know Russian. . .these
people will be helping with scanning, finding books, etc.
The messages will be in MS Word's .doc format in Cyrillic,
we need them translated into English, also in a .doc file.
Thanks!!!     Contact Jared Buck  &lt;JBuck814366460@aol.com&gt;

Please visit and test our newest site:

www.pgcc.net
[also available as  www.gutenberg.us and www.gutenberg.cc]


The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center [PGCC]

Please let us know of any eBook collections that
would be suitable for inclusion:  public domain
or copyrighted, for which we must ask permission.
[or listed as copyrighted with permission]

You should see some significant changes this week.


*

There is a new experimental online reader available. Start from any
bibliographic record page, e.g.

    http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://www.pgdp.net

for more information about how you can help a lot by
simply proofreading just a few pages per day, or more.

If you have a book that has been scanned, but not yet run
through OCR (optical character recognition) or proofed,
and you would like the Distributed Proofreaders to work on it,
please email dphelp@pgdp.net and we will get things started.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online,
visit http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file)
listing Project Gutenberg eBooks and is available for downloading.

Do you have Public Domain books you would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team! Please email dphelp@pgdp.net with your geographic
location. You will be given the address of the nearest high-speed scanner.
[Note that the high-speed scanner requires destruction of the book(s) which
will not be returned.]  We have high-speed scanners currently located in
the east, west and central portions of the US to make shipping easier.

Please make sure that any books you send are _not_ already in the archive
and please check them against David's "In Progress" list at:

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you obtain copyright clearance before mailing the books, and send the 'OK'
lines to

dphelp@pgdp.net

Do you like to work on an entire book at once but don't have the time
or technology to do the scanning, OCR, and initial proofing yourself?
Distributed Proofreaders has the perfect solution!  Just send us email
telling us that you are interested in post-processing and we will help
find a project you would like to work on.

Please contact us at:

dphelp@pgdp.net

if you would like to know more about the Distributed Proofreaders.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet???

With 15,530 eBooks online as of February 23, 2005 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$1.01 from each book.
1% of the world population is 64,112,028 x 15,530 x $1.01 = $1+ trillion

With 15,530 eBooks online as of February 23, 2005 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.64 from each book,
This "cost" is down from about $.87 when we had 11,573 eBooks a year ago.
100 million readers is only ~1.5% of the world's population!

At 15,530 eBooks in 33 Years and 07.75 Months We Averaged
      ~462 Per Year
        38.5 Per Month
         1.26 Per Day

At 574 eBooks Done In The 49 Days Of 2005 We Averaged
      11.7 Per Day
      82 Per Week
     332 Per Month

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 5th was
the first Wednesday of 2005, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2004 and began the production year of 2005 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

PHONE COMPANY SUSPECTED OF BLOCKING VOIP CALLS
The FCC's investigating whether a rural phone company blocked access to
the Vonage Internet-phone service, which was competing for the phone
company's customers. The company has not been identified. The problem became
public several days ago when Larry Lessig, a professor at Stanford Law
School and an advocate of Internet freedom, mentioned Vonage's problem at an
industry conference in Boulder, Colorado. Shutting off a potential

NO RFID TAGS FOR SCHOOL KIDS -- AT LEAST FOR NOW

[I remember the same fight 50 years about out registering dogs and bikes,
and everyone thought how silly it was, but now we have to register cats.]

The InCom company, which developed Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
tags to monitor the whereabouts of school children, has pulled out of a deal
with Brittain Elementary School in Sutter, California. School principal
Earnie Graham says, "I'm disappointed... I think I let my staff down. Nobody
on this campus knows every student." Dawn Cantrall, the parent who objected
to the system and brought the ACLU in to stop its implementation, remains
skeptical: "I'm not convinced it's over. I'm happy for now that kids are not
being tagged, but I'm still fighting to keep it out of our school system. It
has to stop here." The system was conceived as a way of simplifying
attendance-taking, reducing vandalism, and keeping students safe.

'D' IS FOR 'DISMAL' U.S. GOV'T CYBERSECURITY
Despite widespread agreement that computer security should be a top
priority of U.S. government agencies, the latest cybersecurity progress
report from Congress rates overall government efforts a D-, with seven of
the 24 largest agencies earning a failing grade -- including the
departments of Energy and Homeland Security, which, ironically, houses the
National Cyber Security Division. "Several agencies continue to receive
failing grades, and that's unacceptable," says Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.),
chair of the House Government Reform Committee. But on the bright side,
says Davis, "We're also seeing some exceptional turnarounds." Those include
the departments of Transportation (up from a D+ to an A-), Justice (up from
an F to a B-) and the Interior (up from an F to a C+). Davis notes that
problem areas include lax security at federal contractor computers; a lack
of contingency planning for broad system failures; and scant training
opportunities for employees responsible for computer security.

EDS SHIFTS CALL CENTER WORK TO INDIA

[Isn't this Ross Perot's company?]

EDS, a company that manages many corporate computer systems, plans to
close 21 call centers in the U.S. and Europe by the end of 2006 and shift
some of that work to India. EDS already operates three centers in India,
where salaries are much lower in the United States. EDS says that any U.S.
job losses would be by attrition and would be part of the 15,000 to 20,000
job eliminations that were revealed by the company last fall. Currently,
about 30,000 of the company's 120,000 employees work on software
applications, 27% of them in India and other "offshore" locations.

[more on outsourcing]

LEGISLATION AGAINST BUSINESSES THAT OUTSOURCE
Colorado state senator Deanna Hanna has introduced legislation to
require that state to stop doing business with companies that outsource work
overseas instead of hiring U.S. workers. But critics of her bill say it
would actually cost the state millions of dollars, because so many companies
now rely on the practice of "offshoring." U.S. Bank economist Tucker Hart
Adams says Hanna's bill "will cost the state in terms of jobs, creating a
healthy economy, a good place to do business. Closed economies don't work."

U.N. PANEL HOPES TO END WEB WAR
A U.N.-sponsored panel aims to settle a long-running tug of war for
control of the Internet at a Tunis meeting this November at the World Summit
on the Information Society, where global control of the World World Wide Web
may be decided. At present, the most recognizable Internet governance body
is the U.S.-based non-profit corporation called the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), but developing countries want an
international body such as the UN's International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) to have control over governance over Internet issues -- ranging from
distributing Web site domains to fighting spam. (The Australian 22 Feb 2005)

ATLANTA SUBWAYS TO FEATURE TV SCREENS
Atlanta's subway system, MARTA (the Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit
Authority), will be the first in the country to offer TV on its trains, and
will begin showing closed-caption local news programming this spring. An
Atlanta company called the Rail Network, which is providing the technology,
will pay MARTA at least $20 million from revenues derived from commercials
shown on half-hour local newscasts provided by Atlanta TV station WSB. The
TV screens will be visible from every part of MARTA's rail cars, and audio
in English or Spanish will be available to passengers with headphones
attached to radio FM tuners or cellphones with adapters. (Atlanta Journal

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people  would  possess  59%  of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
