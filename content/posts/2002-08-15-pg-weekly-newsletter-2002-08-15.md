Requests For Assistance:

We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czeck by Karel
Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but
available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY
Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can
compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact
Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;.

***

Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language
dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested
in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is
acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where
they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at
cannona@fireantproductions.com

The Distributed Proofreading Team is proud to annouce that they have
now completed over 400 e-texts! Stop on by and give us a hand with
the next 400! http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg

David Widger would like to complete the works of Edward Bulwer Lytton for
Project Gutenberg and has two bookshelves of these books scanned--but he is
running out of steam.  He will mail a printed book and email the raw text
file ready for proofing to anyone who would like to produce one of these
books giving any guidance needed to those who are new to the game.

Many Thanks!

Please Reply to:

Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books
which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.

Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive's
(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner

http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02

While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively
limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited
scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to
17" by 23"),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.

Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,
and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level
surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned
singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending
upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).
The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is
outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less
demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to
delicate pages and bindings.

Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!

I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.

A new mailing list "gut-tv@listserv.unc.edu" has been added.
This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or
monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show "Free
eBooks This Week" which highlights the free eBooks posted in the
past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help
write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to
Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe
to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on
all the TV goings on!

Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML

In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably
text-based - music format and equally significant developments
in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to
announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.

While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad
based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for
music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically
and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and
expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables
the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive
details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from
http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.

As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,
but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as
a first major series too. If you'd be interested in a unique outlet for your
love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki
(gpawlicki@earthlink.net) or check out the volunteer pages at

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.

Thanks for your interest !

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Statistical Review

(This number includes the 85 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site)


In the first 32 weeks of the new year, we have produced 1,448 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production

With 5,750 eTexts online as of August 14th, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.75 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.6 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.73 when we had 3731 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing $.98 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 5,000 books each costing 33% less a year later???

[They Literally Want To Make It Illegal To Skip Commercials Instantly]

CONSUMER SUIT SIDETRACKED IN HOLLYWOOD-VS.-REPLAYTV
A federal judge has brushed to the side legal efforts by the Electronic
Frontier Foundation on behalf of five owners of ReplayTV systems who claim
they are threatened by a lawsuit against SonicBlue, the Santa Clara company
that makes that device. The ReplayTV 4000 system is an advanced recording
device that allows watchers to make digital copies of TV shows and to skip
commercials, and SonicBlue is being sued by 28 movie studios and TV
networks on the grounds that the device encourages piracy and its
widespread adoption would harm the industry. The Electronic Frontier
Foundation and the consumers it represents argue that the decision would
affect them and even make them indictable for piracy, and that they should
therefore be allowed to participate in the lawsuit; however, Judge
Florence-Marie Cooper says that "many, if not all" of their issues can be
resolved by the trial without their direct input.

JUNK FAXES
The Federal Communications Commission wants to levy a $5.4 million fine on
Fax.com, a company that uses a fax-number database to distribute faxed ads
for its customers (restaurants, auto repair shops, and so forth). The FCC
said that Fax.com has "engaged in a pattern of deception to conceal its
involvement in sending the prohibited faxes," which has been banned since
the passage of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. Fax.com's
attorney, Mary Ann Wymore, regards the ban as "a clear infringement on
commercial speech rights," and predicts it ultimately will be overturned by
the U.S. Supreme Court. (Wall Street Journal 8 Aug 2002)

MCNEALY PREDICTS 30% ANNUAL GROWTH IN LINUX USERS
Addressing participants at the Linux World Conference and Expo, Sun
Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy predicted Tuesday that the number of Linux
users will grow by 30% a year for the next several years, and urged
companies to embrace the open-source software movement. Documenting his own
company's commitment, McNealy noted that Sun has at least 400 full-time
employees dedicated to Linux and pledged to abide by the ethical standards
of the Linux community, which is made up of thousands of grassroots
enthusiasts worldwide who collaborate on software projects. "We're going to
share in the lifestyle and be a capitalist," said McNealy. "We'll share our
thoughts but we don't think it's broken so we're not going to try to fix
it," he said, referring to fears that companies could take the open source
code and factionalize it by creating competing proprietary versions.

BLAME THE ECONOMY, NOT PIRACY, FOR WEAK CD SALES
A Forrester Research report released Tuesday says that the true threat to
record labels' profits is the sagging economy, and that downloadable music
could actually prove to be the industry's salvation rather than its
scourge. According to the report's findings, people who download music from
the Internet more than nine times a month -- a relatively small percentage
of the overall market -- say they'll decrease their album purchases by 2%.
At the same time, 39% of downloading enthusiasts said they bought more CDs,
because they found new music that they wanted to purchase through their
file-swapping activities. Meanwhile, it turns out that consumers who rarely
or never download music account for more than two-thirds of CD sales in the
U.S. With music sales slumping nearly 10% this year so far, report author
Josh Bernoff says the true culprits are limited radio playlists,
high-priced CDs and a general economic recession. The Forrester report
suggests that record labels should offer more flexible pricing and online
access to their entire music back-catalogues in order to make online
music-buying more consumer-friendly. The predicted payoff (which some view
as excessively optimistic) could amount to a boost of $937 million in album
downloads, $805 million in singles downloads and $313 million in
subscription fees by 2007. (Los Angeles Times 14 Aug 2002)

MOBILE PHONE REPLACES PHOTO ALBUM FOR PICTURE STORAGE
Proud parents in Japan are just as likely to whip out their mobile phones
to show you pictures of their children as fumble through their wallets for
school photos. The latest generation of cell phones feature tiny cameras
and full-color screens, in addition to digital zoom lenses,
higher-resolution displays and enough memory to store hundreds of photos,
and analysts predict that these new features will prove irresistible to
American and European consumers as the 3G handsets hit the global market.
"It's often said that Japanese love cameras, but Europeans and Americans in
particular see family photos as something special, even putting them up in
their cubicles at work," says Gartner analyst Nahoko Mitsuyama. "Theirs is
a culture that puts a high value on photos, and if that can be tapped into,
I think there'll be demand for these products outside Japan as well."

NEW ELECTRON MICROSOCOPE
IBM and the Nion Corporation have created an electron microscope optics
system that sets the direction for a new generation of microscopes capable
of resolving subatomic images using an electron beam one three-billionth of
an inch in diameter. One likely application of the new microscopes will be
the analysis of advanced semiconductor transistors, in which the tolerances
are so fine that a transistor will fail if a single atom falls out of
place. (New York Times 7 Aug 2002)

When it took over the Internet services of bankrupt Excite@Home, AT&T
didn't raise the fees of Excite customers, it just reduced their download
speeds (by as much as 80%). It told them that their "lightning-fast"
connection to the Internet had been "optimized for all users through a
maximum network setting of 1.5 Mbps downstream." Responding to charges that
his company had essentially played a trick on consumers, AT&T's vice
advertising and other economics that didn't pan out the way people had
hoped." (USA Today 8 Aug 2002)

Various academic institutions now use antiplagiarism software to catch
student cheaters -- but some critics say such software tramples on student
Turnitin.com expands its database by keeping copies of scanned student
papers without getting the permission from the student; the papers can then
be used for comparison with new submissions as they are received in the
future. Is this a permissible practice? Sure, says Turnitin -- this use of
the papers doesn't threaten any potential commercial value of the papers
and is well within "Fair Use" rules. [Antiplagiarism aficionados will enjoy
Bernard Malamud's 1961 novel "A New Life," in which faculty members work
frantically but unsuccessfully to expose a student.] (IEEE Computer Aug 2002)

Headlines From Edupage:

SPAM ON THE RISE
Analysts offer varying explanations, but e-mail spam is definitely on
the increase. According to Brightmail Inc., which monitors junk e-mail,
June of 2001 saw 879,000 spam attacks; June of this year saw 4.8
million. The company also reports that the percentage all e-mail that
is spam has risen from 7 percent a year ago to between 12 and 15
percent today. Some speculate that the weak economy encourages spam as
a marketing vehicle because it is relatively inexpensive. Others cite
the ongoing battle between those who want to get unsolicited e-mails
delivered to users and those who want to filter it out. All acknowledge
that the increase of spam means it is not simply a nuisance but a daily
problem. Much time is wasted dealing with spam, and many legitimate
messages, for example, are deleted when users suspect them of being spam.

RIAA TO APPEAL WEB RADIO ROYALTY
The decision by Librarian of Congress James Billington to charge Web
radio stations .07 cents per song/per listener has apparently pleased
no one. Immediately after the ruling, small Webcasters, including many
college-owned radio stations and other nonprofit stations, said the
rate was too high and would put them out of business. Now the Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA) has said it will appeal the
rate, saying it is too low and does not adequately compensate artists
or record labels. The RIAA charges that Billington's decision rested
on a misinterpretation of testimony from Yahoo and on ignoring certain
licensing deals. If these factors had been considered appropriately,
said the RIAA, the rate would have been "significantly higher."

GOVERNMENT WANTS TO REINVENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
A new project from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) has as its goal the "total reinvention of technologies for
storing and accessing information." The Total Information Awareness
(TIA) system, which will be funded by grants from DARPA, is an attempt
by the federal government to construct a highly data-intensive system
that can spot clues to terrorist plans long before they come to
fruition. Grant applicants are warned that no money will be invested in
"research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to
existing technology"; officials are committed to a fundamental redesign
of technology. TIA plans call for unprecedented amounts of data,
measured in petabytes, to be stored and accessed. Civil liberties
groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation find the prospect
of such a system very worrisome without strict rules to prevent it from
becoming a powerful secret spy machine.
