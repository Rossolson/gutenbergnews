Subject: Etext #1492 & #1500, Project Gutenberg Newsletter, September, 1998
From: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@prairienet.org&gt;
To: "Michael S. Hart" &lt;hart@pobox.com&gt;
Date: Wed, 5 Aug 1998 17:11:14 -0500 (CDT)


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for Wednesday, August 5, 1998
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]

Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
New sites going up in Brazil and Australia, as below:  Africa needed!!

***

We should be posting Etext #1500 in a few weeks, and we would like your
suggestions for possible titles to use for #1500.  One suggestion is to
start our new Public Domain Edition of Shakespeare then, with #1500 but
I had #1600 in mind for that, to coincide with the average dates of his
major publications, but that is not at all cast in stone or electrons--
as we have requests for some of the dates surrounding #1600 as follows:

The Holy Bible, Douay Rheims Version, O.T. Part 2 [2drvbxxx.xxx]1610
The Holy Bible, Douay Rheims Version, O.T. Part 1 [1drvbxxx.xxx]1609
The Holy Bible, Douay Rheims Version, N.T.        [3drvbxxx.xxx]1582
Holy Bible, Douay Rheims Version, Both Testaments [0drvbxxx.xxx]1581

So. . .your suggestions would be MOST welcome, on these titles or on
other titles you might have in mind that could possible be done by a
month from now.

***

We also have a number of requests for help from some of our Directors
and other major volunteers.

We have had multiple requests for various editions of Homer.

We would also love to post one, if we could
find a matching paper edition, pre-1923, to
any that might already be on the Net. . . .
Or we can start from scratch.

We've had a major response to this, so we include it again:

New Project Gutenberg mirror sites:

Please try our newest sites in Australia:
http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/gutenberg/
ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/gutenberg/

and

http://www.library.adelaide.edu.au/etext/pg

Since I last wrote to you, I've made a number of improvements to the mirror:

1. There's a search option, whereby users can enter one or more search
terms, and use boolean and/or, to locate texts.

2. There's a list by author for those who want to browse.

3. The user can select (generally) between text and zip formats. Only one
format is stored, to save space, but conversion to the other is done
on-the-fly when requested.

I've also created a USMARC-format catalog, which is used for searching.
This is still a long way from being something that Librarians would not
sneer at, but provides brief-entry records for the texts. I built this from
the GUTINDEX.ALL list, followed by (too many) hours of manual editing. You
can view the result at:

http://www.library.adelaide.edu.au/etext/pg/catalog.txt

There's a very good Brazilian site that provides public domain
electronic books. It's called VirtualStore
(www.elogica.com.br/virtualstore)
and Bilblioteca Virtual do Estudante Brasileiro
(Brazilian Student Virtual Library), at bibvirt.futuro.usp.br

&gt;From Edupage:


INFORMATION AGE HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS
Asked about the impact of computers and the Internet on society, Vanderbilt
University management professor Donna Hoffman says:  "Will we really
transform society through the use of computers and the Internet? Well, the
jury is still out.  I certainly think the potential is there, but it will be
realized only if we can get access in the hands of everyone.  Otherwise, we
are not likely to see revolutionary changes.  And we will still have the
schisms and chasms in society where there will be sectors of society in
which people are able to partake of the wonderful riches online, and at the
same time other groups are effectively excluded.  I don't think there will
be much evidence of the transforming powers found in creating new sources of
value until we have people online who we never thought would come online.
If we're serious about change, we need to be thinking of getting entire
countries -- the developing countries and societies -- online.  (Exec Sum 98)

MIT'S MANAGEMENT SCHOOL SAYS NO MORE PAPER APPLICATIONS
MIT's Sloan School of Management says it will no longer accept paper
applications, opting instead for a fully electronic application process.
School officials say the move will save thousands of dollars in processing,
printing and postage costs, plus hundreds of hours of staff time.  The
school will, however, stick with snail-mail for the back end of the process
-- acceptance and rejection letters will be shipped via the U.S. Postal
Service.  (Investor's Business Daily 4 Aug 98)

FCC TO HOLD HEARINGS ON DISPARITIES IN TECHNOLOGY ACCESS
The Federal Communications Commission will hold hearings this fall to try to
determine why minority groups are less likely to have telephone service or
own a computer than white families.  A U.S. Commerce Department reports
indicates that 96% of white households have basic phone service, compared to
about 86% of black households and Hispanic households;  similarly about 41%
of white families own a computer, compared to about 19% of black and
Hispanic families.  FCC chairman Bill Kennard says, "Does this gap in access
to technology matter?  You bet it does.  How can you look for a job without
a phone?  How can you demonstrate that you have the skills to compete if you
don't know which side of a diskette goes in first?"  (AP 3 Aug 98)
[More on the same story, with a little better statistics:  I counted as one]
STUDY SHOWS WIDENING GAP IN COMPUTER OWNERSHIP
A new study by the U.S. Commerce Department shows that PC ownership among
all Americans grew by 52% between 1994 and 1997, with a penetration of 36.6%
of U.S. households.  But although penetration among blacks and Hispanics
grew faster than the overall rate, the disparity between them and white
households actually widened during that period.  At the end of 1997, 40.8%
of non-Hispanic white households owned a PC, compared to 19.4% of Hispanic
and 19.3% of African-American households, a gap of 21.5%.  In 1994, the
Commerce Department reported a gap of 16.8%.  The study also found that
whites were much more likely to subscribe to an online service than either
blacks or Hispanics.  "The study exposes a growing problem in our economy,
one that must be taken seriously:  too many Americans are not able to take
part in the growing digital economy," says Commerce Secretary William Daley.
"The growing trend of information 'haves' and 'have-nots' is alarming."
(Miami Herald 31 Jul 98)

RIOTS FOLLOW BRAZIL'S SALE OF NATIONAL PHONE SYSTEM
Brazil's national phone company Telebras has been sold for almost $19
billion in the largest privatization deal in Latin American history -- a
deal dominated by Spain's Telefonica, Portugal's Telecom, and the U.S.
company MCI.  Police used tear gas, batons, and a water cannon to control
thousands of angry demonstrators fearful that foreign owners of phone
services will ignore the needs of the Brazilian poor.  (Washington Post 30
Jul 98)

***We don't usually include the following, but due to request:


Most people start with surfing to promo.net to get the Guteberg Etexts...

There are many sites around the world containing Project Gutenberg Etexts,
only two of which we actually maintain directly:  prairienet.org and also
archive.org.  uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu mirrors prairienet at 3AM & 3PM, and
is a much faster site.  You may find that some of these sites are faster,
much faster, from you location, but you may also find that some sites are
easier for you to use, depending on how you like to search our collection
of electronic book.  Of course, you can always download GUTINDEX.* files,
and do you own searching with your own favorite program.  That's my way!!
But many people really like the indexing and added information available,
especially from promo.net and sailor, as below.

Our major web site is promo.net, which links to get you the books and....

We are now testing a new site at...
www.thalasson.com/pjb/gtn/index.htm

Many more below, some will be faster for you than others further away.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]


To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"

	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.
