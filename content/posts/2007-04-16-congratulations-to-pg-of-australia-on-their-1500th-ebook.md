Congratulations to Project Gutenberg Australia for reaching eBook number #1500. Here are some words from both Colin Choat and Michael Hart.

### Milestones at Project Gutenberg of Australia

Recently we added ebook #1500 to our collection. One does not usually single out a volunteer for mention but it seems appropriate on this occasion. Significantly, the ebook was provided by Don Lainson of Canada and was his 250th contribution to Project Gutenberg of Australia. When one considers that many of the titles making up our 1500 titles are short stories which appeared in magazines and periodicals, the 'weight' of Don's contribution is even more impressive.

Don became a volunteer in 2001, soon after Project Gutenberg of Australia was started. His first book (our 14th) was 'Bush Studies' by Barbara Baynton. He soon followed up with works by Edgar Rice Burroughs, D H Lawrence, George Orwell and F Scott Fitfgerald and his book list is now an impressive one of classics and bestsellers, interspersed with lighter works. Don's work with Project Gutenberg of Australia followed a period during which he submitted books to Project Gutenberg in the United States.

One does not boast a collection of 1500 ebooks without the help of MANY volunteers and there have been many who have submitted many books. One does not usually single out one name for recognition, for fear of overlooking others. I could not, however, let the occasion pass without acknowledgment of Don's contribution to the success of Project Gutenberg of Australia.

Our ebook #1500 is 'A Scot's Quair' by Lewis Grassic Gibbon, a landmark work in Scottish literature, set against the background of the First World War and the industrial unrest and poverty of the nineteen thirties. 'A Scot's Quair' can be accessed from <http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#gibbon>.

### Congratulations to PG of Australia on their 1500th eBook

Many thanks and congratulations to Project Gutenberg of Australia on their 1500th eBook!!! Since it took me and many volunteers the years from 1971 to 1998 to get from 1 to 1500, I can certainly do some serious appreciating of the effort and stamina required, and I also know a little of the volunteerism of Australia, though not nearly enough, I am sure.

My most heartfelt congratulations!!!
