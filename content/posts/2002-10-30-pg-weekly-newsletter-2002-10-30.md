CIA FACT BOOK READY FOR FORMATTING  [Third Request]

The 2002 edition of the CIA World Fact Book is now
available at http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html
Project Gutenberg needs a volunteer to harvest and reformat
this work into plain text (HTML is optional).  See our previous
WFB's for formatting idea.  Interested?  Email gbnewby@ils.unc.edu

***

Second Request for Alice

If we could get a volunteer to scan them in a similarly large size
to the other Alice illustrations, then I could have a go at producing
an illustrated version of "Through the Looking Glass".
[This would require scanning about 50 illustrations]

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be

Statistical Review

In the first 43 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,916 new eBooks.



The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was
was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production
year of 2001 and began the production year of 2002.

With 6,206 eTexts online as of October 30, 2002 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.61 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from $2.48 when we had 4006 Etexts A Year Ago

Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.87 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

[My Comments In Brackets]


Headlines From Newsscan

VERIZON SILENCES SUPER-SPAMMER
Verizon has reached a legal settlement that bans Alan Ralsky, whose company
Additional Benefits LLC is considered to be one of the world's largest
sources of bulk e-mail, from sending messages to its 1.64 million Internet
access customers. Verizon had filed its lawsuit against Ralsky in March
2001 after several incidents in which Verizon customers were inundated with
millions of e-mail solicitations for online casinos, diet pills, credit
repair services, etc. The complaint said Ralsky broke federal and Virginia
laws by, among other things, clogging its network with illegitimate
e-mails. Ralsky must also pay an undisclosed fine, but apparently remains
unfazed the recent action, stating that he has lists of 150 million e-mail
addresses, so the Verizon case will eliminate only a small portion of those.
(AP 30 Oct 2002)  http://apnews.excite.com/article/20021030/D7MVTD300.html

The software developer 321 Studios, based in St. Louis, Mo., plans to start
using its Web site to sell downloadable copies of its software for making
backup copies of DVD movies. The Motion Picture Association of America
(whose chairman Jack Valenti has called DVD recorders "the newest incarnation
of movie piracy") will probably file a lawsuit against 321, but the company's
making backup copies of the movies you already own. We feel it's legal."

GOOGLE CENSORS SEARCH RESULTS FOR FRENCH AND GERMAN USERS
A report from Harvard Law School found that when users from France and
Germany tap Google's search engine, at least 100 sites are automatically
deleted from the search results. Most of the missing sites promote either
white supremacy or Holocaust denial. Both France and Germany have strict
laws banning hate speech, and a Google spokesman says the company must
occasionally remove sites to avoid legal liability. Such removals are done
in response to specific requests and are not done preemptively, he added.
"We carefully consider any credible complaint on a case-by-case basis and
take necessary action. We only react to requests that come to us." Harvard
Law School researchers found about 65 sites that were excluded from
Google.de, the German site, and about 113 sites were missing at Google.fr,
the French site. (AP 24 Oct 2002)

SMALLEST COMPUTER EVER
Although their achievement is nowhere near any kind of practical
application, IBM scientists have used individual carbon monoxide particles
so develop the world's smallest logic circuit, less than one trillionth of
a square inch (and therefore about 260,000 times smaller than
state-of-the-art silicon transistors). Donald M. Eigler, head of the IBM
Times 25 Oct 2002)

HOLLYWOOD GOES TO WORK TO STOP DIGITAL PIRACY
Hollywood studios and record companies are asking the heads of U.S.
corporations to prevent their employees from using high-speed company
networks to download copyrighted material from peer-to-peer services such
as Kazaa and Gnutella which are used to exchange songs and movies. The
letter sent by these groups suggests that businesses could be held liable
for the copyright infringements made by their workers.

RECORD COMPANIES DECIDE THE INTERNET WON'T GO AWAY
The latest evidence that the recording industry is trying to come to terms
with "peer-to-peer" music downloads from the Internet, the independent
Internet service Rhapsody, operated by Listen.com, will start allowing
users to record CDs using about 100,000 songs from Universal and Warner
Music record companies. Listen.com's Dave Williams says that financial
pressures on the recording industry have forced it to change its
fundamental business plan. "A few years ago, their secret wish for the
Internet to go away. Now there's enthusiasm about the possibilities."
Rhapsody charges a $9.95-a-month subscription fee plus 99 cents for each
song a subscriber choose to burn onto a CD. (USA Today 24 Oct 2002)

Headlines From Edupage

SURVEY SAYS COPY-PROTECTED CDS COULD BACKFIRE
Results from a survey by Gartner indicate that many consumers do not
see copy protections as a reasonable precaution against music piracy
because such protections would infringe on consumers' right to copy
CDs they purchased. Sixty percent of those surveyed said they should be
allowed to make copies of CDs for family members; 77 percent said they
should be allowed to make copies for other devices; and 82 percent said
backup copies should be allowed. Researchers involved in the study
suggested that music companies that opt for copy protections are likely
to annoy many consumers, possibly resulting in lower revenues.

IBM RAISES THE BAR ON COMPUTER SMALLNESS
New research from IBM purports to make it possible to create computer
logic elements 260,000 times smaller than they are today. The so-called
"molecule cascade" technique relies on movements of individual
molecules to perform computation, compared to the process of
silicon-based computing, which moves electrons through materials.
Researchers have built several circuits using the technique, which one
researcher compared to putting tennis balls in an egg carton. The balls
are too large for the spaces, so they touch each other, with each
ball's motion affecting the others'. The most complex of the
experimental circuits is 12 by 17 nanometers in size, allowing 190
billion of them on a standard pencil eraser. Researchers admit that the
technology is many years away from real-world implementation but said
that it represents a fundamentally new approach to computing.

REPORT FROM HARVARD EXPOSES FILTERING AT GOOGLE
A report written by a law student and a professor at Harvard University
identifies more than 100 Web sites that are included in search results
from Google.com but that have been deleted from the search engine's
French and German sites, Google.fr and Google.de. The excluded sites
include content that is anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi, or otherwise racially
or ethnically intolerant. A spokesman from Google confirmed that the
company excludes sites whose content may be in violation of local laws.
He said sites are not removed unless a specific complaint is filed, and
only then after a careful review by lawyers, management, and engineers.
Ben Edelman, one of the authors of the Harvard report, said some of the
delisted sites appear not to violate any German or French laws. He
expressed concern that Google is being unnecessarily secretive about
what sites are excluded.
