.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

And if you haven't done so lately, please visit the website at

<pre>=============================================================================

With the posting of eBook #12973, Project Gutenberg will be including
the scanned page images when they are available.  The following is an
edited summary of this policy (with Thanks! to Jim Tinsley):

This is the first PG book to be posted with page images. We are just now
beginning to accept page images along with the regular postings.  Prior
to this only eBooks in their final format (text, HTML, etc.) were being
accepted and posted.  Of course, Project Gutenberg Distributed
Proofreaders has always preserved its page images, and those will
eventually be made available.

Page images will be posted _only_ as an addition to an etext posted in
the normal way -- we will not post page images without plain text.  Also,
page images are an option; they are not and will not be required for the
posting of an etext.

Our goal is that all of the page images submitted should be good enough
to work reasonably well with OCR packages, up to 600 dpi, and should be
stored as black-and-white TIFFs with CCITT-4 (aka ITU-G4 or Fax Group 4)
compression.

And finally, for the forseeable future, these image files will only be
available as compressed archives; in the case of this first posting, the
filename is 12973-page-images.z-p.  (Yes, we are still unable to include
"that" three-letter word in our mailings.)  Also, be aware that this file
is 12.3MB!  The compressed archive of the HTML with images is only 394kB.

As this is the first such posting, it can be anticipated that procedures
will be refined over the coming months.  Be sure to check the web site for
more information.

I know all the answers, just at the wrong time.
