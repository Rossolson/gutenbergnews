This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for January 2015

Welcome to the first newsletter of 2015.  This is Project Gutenberg's
44th year!

CONTENTS

* Anniversary of "Alice"
* Contemporary advice from Leonardo
* Project Gutenberg turned into a clock
* New eBook listings from December 2014


* Anniversary of "Alice"

Thanks to Christina Heal, who reminded us that 2015 will be the 150th
anniversary of Alice in Wonderland.  There will be lots of rereleases.

Your humble newsletter editor (Greg N.) remembers the first eBook he
ever heard of: It was sometime in 1987 or so, while I was a student
at SUNY Albany.  My friend emailed me a copy of the "Millenium
Fulcrum" edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which became
Project Gutenberg's eBook #11:
  www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11

What many readers might not realize is that Project Gutenberg now has
at least eight versions of this book, with different illustrations and
translations.  Find them here:
  www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/7

Plus, find the famous Tenniel illustrations, which helped shape many
people's Disney-esque envisioning of Alice and friends.

* Contemporary advice from Leonardo

As found in an article about how to make a room look bigger, Project
Gutenberg's #5000, Leonardo da Vinci is quoted:

  http://www.anglianhome.co.uk/goodtobehome/room-inspiration/how-to-make-a-room-look-bigger-infographic/#.VJKtICusWVM

  "Small rooms or dwellings discipline the mind, large ones weaken it."


* Project Gutenberg turned into a clock

Thanks to Ross Goodwin for sharing another innovative use of the
Project Gutenberg library:

  I used the complete English archives of Project Gutenberg to make
  this.  Just thought you'd like to see it:

  The page may take a few seconds to load, depending on the speed of
  your internet connection. Hope you enjoy it!
