## 51 Years of eBooks

July 4 2022 was the 51st anniversary of the invention of eBooks by Michael Hart. You can read all about this in our 50-years celebration page from 2021,https://www.gutenberg.org/about/background/50years.html

You can still read the world's first eBook created for reading pleasure and sharing, the US Declaration of Independence. Find it online athttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1

Like many Project Gutenberg eBooks, our #1 has been updated over the years. In 1971, there was no lower case available on the teletype that Michael used to type the Declaration of Independence - that was added later. We have an eBook that describes production processes and how they have evolved over the years:https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60600


## US Copyright Term Sanity

The 1998 copyright extensions in the US always involved a high degree of risk for the corporations, since there's no obvious public support for them. The lobbyists and their politicians knew this, since they went to extreme lengths to distract the public from noticing what was going on -- just like their Canadian counterparts today!

In the US, on May 10th Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the Copyright Clause Restoration Act which "would limit new copyright protections to 56 years and make the change retroactive for massive corporations like Disney that have been granted unnecessarily long copyright monopolies." See:https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-introduces-bill-strip-disney-special-copyright-protections

We don't know where this bill will lead, but it is a welcome recognition that unduly long copyright terms do not achieve what the US Founders envisioned - to encourage the creative arts. Instead, overly long copyright terms, of 95 years in the US, benefit publishers and heirs and few others.
