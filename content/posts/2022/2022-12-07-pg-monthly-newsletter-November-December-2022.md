## In memoriam: Harry Hilton

Project Gutenberg learned only recently of the death of Dr. Harry Hilton. Dr. Hilton was a Board member of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, which operates Project Gutenberg.

Dr. Hilton was a long-time mentor and friend to Project Gutenberg and its founder Michael S. Hart. When PGLAF was first formed in the year 2000, he was one of the inaugural board members and remained an active member until shortly before his death.

Project Gutenberg has benefited over the years from the faith and caring of its supporters, and Dr. Hilton was outstanding in this regard. He provided sage and supportive guidance to Michael, and to PGLAF, for decades. We extend our sympathy to Dr. Hilton's family.

The University of Illinois has more information about Dr. Hilton's life and career here:https://aerospace.illinois.edu/news/46217
