To: "Project Gutenberg mailing list" &lt;gutnberg@listserv.unc.edu&gt;

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for: Wednesday, March 8, 2000
***Another message requesting your support is being sent separately***
*If you are not interested, please just delete it without opening it.*

We are in the process of jumping another month ahead of our schedule--
so this may actually be an extra issue of the Newsletter, or may be an
April issue, in disguise. . .we shall see. . . .


This Is The Birthday Of Michael S. Hart, Founder of Project Gutenberg!

[As you read this, he is most likely in the air, destination Romania!]
[A "new" computer is now hitched up to the Net at home in Bucharest so
we should be in quite good touch with him.  However, editing eTexts is
not likely to be easy at such long distances, at least until he gets a
lot of things set up on the new computer, some of which he says should
not be ever expected to work.  So. . .if you possibly can, get the new
header from one of our Directors, and paste it on top of the files you
send, and "fill in the blanks" as best you can.]  [Thanks!!!  Michael]

[This is a preliminary edition, but I wanted to get it out right now.]

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*

Headline News

This Newsletter contains the listings for the first month of
the year 2001.  You will note it now contains 40 listings, as
we have once again accelerated our production schedule, and
we have even gained to being nearly 11 months ahead of schedule.

The Internet Archive, of which I am a Fellow for the year 2000,
has announced a 400 Terabyte hard drive system, apparently this
signals a change from tape drives, which should significantly
speed up searches from their backup "snapshots" of the Web and
other information sources.  This is obviously only on step away
from everyone's "Dream Storage Unit" of a Petabyte.  Everyone
thought I was just being silly when I said we might have to
make up a new unit of storage for 1,000 Petabytes, which I
nicknames a Whamabyte many years ago when everyone said we
would never even have a Petabyte of storage in one place.
The truth is that this is now almost a certainty in my
life expectancy.  You can get details at:

The first 1 Gigahertz home computers are being produced.

It seem ridiculous to say so, but these computers will SOON be:

1,000 times as fast as the original Apples and PCs, and the
NEXT generation after that will be 1,000 times as fast as an AT.

The benchmarks listed below are REAL for the 800 MHz Intel Pentium III
but are merely extraplolations for the AMD Athlon chip.

800 MHz Intel Pentium III     1Ghz Athlon

Benched with program:  Landmark Speed 2.00
CPU Clock 1682.3 MHz           2102.875Ghz   clocks appear doubled
Computer performs like                       due to wide bus words
5160 MHz AT Computer           6450 MHz AT
With a 13600 MHz 80287        17000 MHz 80287

In the last week or two we have posted:

Mar 2000 Carlyle's "History of Friedrich II of Prussia V 20[20frdxxx.xxx]2120
Mar 2000 Carlyle's "History of Friedrich II of Prussia V 19[19frdxxx.xxx]2119

Pietro Di Miceli, our webmaster, has revamped the main PG website at
http://promo.net/pg or http://www.gutenberg.net to make it faster,
easier to use and more up-to-date. We get about three quarters of a
million visitors (not just hits or page impressions!) per month, most of
whom are looking for books by a particular author, so we've added a
simple search to the home page.

Our catalogers can create new entries online using a new database
editing program, and all of the search and browse pages are created on
the fly from that database. The files linked from the homepage
containing Authors, Titles and the whole list are recreated hourly to
ensure that all of the contents are up to date with the database
changes.

Visitors can also select their preferred FTP site at any stage of the
search process.

In addition, we've added a new, expanded site FAQ, subscription info
page and contacts page.

Feedback and comments to Pietro at &lt;webmaster@promo.net&gt;.

We also have a new FTP site in Spain.

ftp://dafi2.dif.um.es

Our server is in the Students Representative Office of the
Computer Sciences Faculty in the University of Murcia (Spain).

Our huge thanks to them!!!

We need someone good with Word Perfect to convert a file of
a new translation of 20,000 Leagues under the Sea from WP61
to Plain DOS Text With Hard Returns.  I am currently working
on this, but might not finish in the next 36 hours. . .I am
on the road again. . . .

Please email Dianne Bean &lt;beandp@primenet.com&gt;, and cc:me
and Alev Akman &lt;aka@telepath.com&gt;

We could use some help with getting Moby Dick into a good format.

Jan 2001 Moby Dick [Chapter 72+]   Herman Melville   HM #3][mobydxxx.xxx]2489

[We are going to need help with this one, see request above. . .we have 135
or so individual files, one for each chapter [122 may be missing] and many
of them are in different formats. . .this could be a labor of love. . .mh]

This is a perfect example of how much effort we put into copyright research!
We have received many versions of Chapter 72 over the years, but none of them
were ones we would PROVE were in the Public Domain under our copyright laws.
[Please note:  We originally received Moby Dick from Online Book Initiative,
10 years ago and it was released as our Etext #15, a very important milestone.
However, it did not include Chapter 72, which we are releasing now, and I am
asking our Directors of Production to create a new edition of Moby Dick, all
in one file [our past edition, which will not be changed, was a zip file with
about 135 files in it. . .please understand how unzipping 135 files might have
affected a drive from 10 years ago.]  This new file currently contains ONLY a
copy of Chapter 72, and will hopefully contain the entire book very shortly.]
