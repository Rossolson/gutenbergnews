GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL! at the New York Musical Theater Festival
By Anthony King and Scott Brown. Directed by Dave Mowers.
Starring Chris Fitzgerald ("Wicked" / "Fully Committed"),
Jeremy Shamos ("The Rivals" / "Reckless") and Matt Castle
(John Doyle's "Company")

Johann Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1450. So Bud
Davenport and Doug Simon wrote a musical about him and they're
bringing it to Broadway. They don't have a cast, a budget, or a
producer . . . but they have a dream!

"A surefire hit ... it's so bang on the money that, were I a
speculative type, I'd almost be tempted to invest," The Daily Telegraph.

Gutenberg! The Musical! is Bud and Doug's backers' audition: a
tuneful, tasteless triumph, celebrating the monstrous success of
their idiocy. Since its sold-out January premiere in London,
performed by the authors, we've been polishing the script and
writing new songs. Now - with a fantastic creative team and hugely
talented new cast - we're bringing it home to New York.

"Utterly brilliant ... the funniest and cleverest spoof I've come
across ... Mel Brooks couldn't have done it better," Clive Davis.

Venue: Sage Theatre (711 7th Avenue, at Times Square).
6 performances only: Fri 22nd Sept (8pm), Mon 25th (4.30pm),
Wed 27th (8pm), Thu 28th (8pm) and Sat 30th (1pm and 4.30pm).
Running time: 90 minutes.

Tickets: $20.00.

To book: call 212-352-3101 or visit
http://www.nymf.org/index.php?module=ShowManager&func=display&sid=497


"Contains more wit and intelligence than three decades of megashows,"

Five Stars! The Times.

For now I am leaving PT1a and PT1b combined.

Please also let me know if you think these Newsletters are a waste of
time or if you think I/we should keep doing them.

Thanks!

Some Suggestions We Received For The Newsletters


0.
Several people have merely suggested to other readers
that they start from both ends and read to the middle
and thus they will get the highlights first, and then
the regular features, requests, etc. that stay pretty
much the same from issue to issue.

I would agree with this suggestion, and would simply,
for my own edification, also read the "Flashback," as
I find it interesting to see Project Gutenberg eBooks
as they appeared in our catalog x years ago.


1.
Divide the Newsletter in Web page URLs so the readers
could just jump to whatever portions they wanted.
[This would take some additional labor by someone who
was more familiar with writing web pages than I.]

You should already be able to jump to whichever parts
you want to read. . .simply use your search commands,
search for "*" plus the section header as outlined in
The Table of Contents.


2.
Redivide PT1 of the Weekly Newsletter into two parts.

[This would create a lot more work for whomever edits
the Newsletters, which probably wouldn't be so bad if
that were their only responsibility.  I work to point
of exhaustion nearly every single day, and I need for
things to become easier rather than harder.  Hence my
requests for anyone who would like to be editor:  the
format of the Newsletter would be their choice and we
could either turn over the statistics to them, or our
stats people could simply send in that portion, ahead
of the deadline by an hour or two.  We would continue
to encourage our readers to send in news items not in
the main regular media coverage.]


*

We are interested in increasing the "SF" available at Project Gutenberg of
Australia. To this end we are happy to receive donations of ebooks to add
to our collection.

SF, in this context can mean: Science, Speculative, Superhero, Swords,
Sorcery, Spies, Supernatural and Scary Fiction.

Of course, we are only able to accept works that are public domain in
Australia.

Generally speaking, this means that the author died in 1954 or earlier.

Please see our WANTED list at http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html for
authors and works of interest. If you have suggestions for authors or
works to add to the list, please let us know.  Do check first that
they are not already available at Project Gutenberg Australia or
Project Gutenberg, please.  Contact details are provided on the WANTED page.

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

  http://gutenberg.net.au/wanted.html

As always, ebooks by Australian authors and of general Australian interest
are always greatly appreciated.

        21,208 [by hand count]       [+121]
               [Please note we have several counting methods,
               and they often differ by several book that we
               have to hunt down by hand to reconcile.]
               [Pleast note there is some duplication between
               these various collections.  Volunteers needed
               to take these duplications into account.]

                ~12% of the way from 20,000 to 30,000

               80,000+ eBooks at the PG Consortia Center
               http://www.gutenberg.cc   [160,000 files]

[Please note that the four collections totals are eBooks that originated
as created, edited, proofread, formatted, etc., by Project Gutenberg and
its 50,000 volunteers, while the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center with
80,000+ eBooks contains entire eBook collections from 100+ eLibraries so
the production statistics given here are for some 20,000+ eBooks created
by the various teams of Project Gutenberg volunteers, for which we share
the responsibility of maintaining.  The Consortia Center eBooks were and
are the responsibility of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy
to forward any suggestions for correction to those eLibraries, but those
eBooks must be edited by the donating parties, as per their requests.]

             18,148 New eBooks Since The Start Of 2001

           That's ~266 eBooks per Month for ~68.25 Months

            3,063 New eBooks in 2006 at These Four Sites

            37 New eBooks From Distributed Proofreaders
             9,038 total from Distributed Proofreaders
              Since October, 2000 [Details in PT1B]
              [Currently over 36,000 DP volunteers]
            [Note, PGDP mostly included in US eBooks]
         [Note, PGEU has its own Distributed Proofreaders
          whose total closely matches their grand total]

             We Averaged ~339 eBooks Per Month In 2004
             We Averaged ~248 eBooks Per Month In 2005
                      [Including PG Australia]


       We Are Averaging ~371 eBooks Per Month This Year!!!
              [Including PGAu, PGEu and PrePrints]

All Four Sites Combined Are Averaging 85 eBooks Per Week In 2006
                       121 This Week
                        85 Last Week
                       121 This Month [Sep]

[Aug. was one of those months with 5 Wednesdays; our work week
runs from about noon Wednesday, Eastern Time Zone, for 7 days]


It took ~32 years, from 1971 to 2003 to do our 1st 10,000 eBooks

It took ~12.5 years from Jan. 1994 to Jun. 2006 to go from 100 to 20,100

It took ~32 months, from 2003 to 2006 for our last 10,000 eBooks

It took ~10 years from 1993 to 2003 to grow from 100 eBooks to 10,100

It took ~2.8 years from Oct. 2003 to Jun. 2006 from 10,000 to 20,000

It took ~2.3 years from Jan. 2004 to Aug. 2006 from 11,000 to 21,000

[Not counting the addition of The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center]

*

[Daily PrePrints stats at http://preprints.readingroo.ms/]

Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire
collections to fully appear in the PrePrints Section, thus
the count sometimes jumps by a large number when the files
are eventually completed and added in.  Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or
The Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, etc.  For example,
on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks appeared,
and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send
them to the PrePrints Section took well over a month.

Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section,
it still takes a certain amount of time to collect and put
such a large collection online in a proper manner.

***Continuing Requests New Sites and Announcements


General Catalog of Old Books and Authors

http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ngcoba/ngcoba.htm

which now indexes 24,000 books available free online, including all
PG(US) & PG(Aus)'s books, along with some basic date information
about them and their authors where you can find more.

Plus many books not available on line, a good place to search
for books by specific authors who you are interested in.

For information please contact Philip Harper
&lt;webmaster AT kingkong.demon.co.uk&gt;

*

We have been invited to peruse the various eBook collections
of the Internet Archive for potential Project Gutenberg eBooks.

http://www.archive.org

Don't worry, many of the numbers listed are out of date,
but you should get all the files when you pass through
to the original sites.

Click on "texts" to get started, feel free to pick up any
of the eBooks you would like to work on.

Many Thanks To Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive!

Please visit and test our newest site:

"PROJECT GUTENBERG EUROPE"

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]

*

There is an experimental online reader available.
Start from any bibliographic record page, e.g.

http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300


Basically this paginates the .txt file and remembers your last position
in a cookie so you can later resume reading where you left off.

Please test it. It should work with any book that has a text file
where the encoding is known.

*

MACHINE TRANSLATION

We are seeking as much information as possible on the various
approaches to Machine Translation. Any brand names or contact
information would be greatly appreciated.

Project Gutenberg Needs DVD Burners


So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via snailmail!!!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners.  If you have a DVD burner
and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon

&lt;cannona@fireantproductions.com&gt;

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVDs
for you to copy.  You can either snail them directly
to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can
do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.
We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVDs which are burnt in the dvd-r format,
as we have had some compatibility issues with the dvd+r format.

Project Gutenberg is seeking graphics we can use for our Web
pages and publicity materials.  If you have original graphics

*Project Gutenberg Consortia Center Report

The PGCC collection at http://www.gutenberg.cc has doubled
in size from the listings below, but we don't have exactly
matching collection sizes yet for a new breakdown.

There are ~160,000 separate downloadable files,
and presuming 50% are reduntant or are required
at the level of more than one file per book:

The number of individual eBooks now is about 80,000.

Thus the grand total of eBooks at Project Gutenberg
is 21,000+ created by Project Gutenberg volunteers,
plus 80,000 donated from over 100 other eLibraries,
to create a downloadble library of 100,000+ eBooks

Average Size of the Collections     8,067.18 Total Files


These eBooks are catalogued as per the instructions of
their donors:  some are one file per book; some have a
file for each chapter; and some even have a file for a
single page or poem. . .or are overcounted for reasons
I have not mentioned. . .each of which could cause the
overcounting or duplication of numbers.

If we presume 2 out of 3 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~45,714 Unique eBooks

If we presume 3 out of 4 of these files are overcounts,
that leaves a unique book total of
                                  ~34,286 Unique eBooks

The new overall collection size, which has reduced the
need to account for duplications and eBooks with files
for each chapter, etc.
[160,000 files representing some 80,000+ Unique eBooks]

***

Please also note that over 25,000 eBooks are listed via
The Online Books Page, of which over 6,300 are from PG.
http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/

In addition:  The Internet Public Library had a similar
listing which is now in limbo.  If anyone knows what is
happening with the IPL, please let us know.  Inquiries,
made months ago, and again recently, have not turned up
any current information.

You can try a new IPL service at:

http://www.ipl.org/div/subject/browse/hum60.60.00/

It would appear that The Internet Public Library ended
its first incarnation with about 22,284 entries, which
has now been surpassed by the Online Books Page.

Still looking for more Internet Public Library info.

Have We Given Away A Trillion Books/Dollars Yet?

If our average eBook has reached just 1% of the world population of
6,543,829,379 that would be 21,211 x 65,438,294 = ~1.39 Trillion !!!

With 21,211 eBooks online as of September 13, 2006 it now takes an average
of ~1% of the world gaining a nominal value of ~$.72 from each book.
[1% world population x #eBooks] 65,438,294 x 21,211 x $.72 = ~$1 Trillion
[Google "world population" "popclock" to get the most current figures.]
[By the way, the US "popclock" is about to turn to 300 million people.]
[Just turning 299.7 million this week!]


A Trillion Dollars Given Away At Just $.47 Value Per Book To 100 Million

With 21,211 eBooks online as of September 13, 2006 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $0.47 from each book.
This "cost" is down from about $.58 when we had 17,130 eBooks a year ago.

Our Target Audience Is 1.5% Of The World Population = ~100 million people.

Next Decade's Target:  15% Of The world Population = 1 billion !!! people.


At 21,211 eBooks in 35 Years and 02.25 Months We Averaged
       603 Per Year
        50 Per Month
         1.65 Per Day

At 3063 eBooks Done In The 252 Days Of 2006 We Averaged
    12.2 Per Day
      85 per Week
     371 Per Month


If you are interested in the population of the world or of the U.S.
you might want to know that these numbers, official as they appear,
are just just estimates, and perhaps not as accurate as we hope.

However, for those keeping track of how quickly the U.S. reaches a
300 million population level, and who noticed the passing of 298M,
just two weeks ago. . .the U.S. is already 1/6 the way to 299M, so
it will probably be 10 more weeks to 299M and 22 more to 300M.

Recently the U.S. Congress, pertaining to district reapportionment,
who gets to vote for which Congresspeople, decided that many of the
districts were undercounted by 5%, perhaps then later deciding that
all districts had been undercounted by 5% [can't recall details].

*

The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks'
production; each production-week starts/ends Wednesday noon,
starts with the first Wednesday of January.  January 4th was
the first Wednesday of 2006, and thus ended PG's production
year of 2005 and began the production year of 2006 at noon.

This year there will be 52 Wednesdays, thus no extra week.

[PG Editor's Comments In Brackets]

PUBLISHERS GIVE ONLINE MAGAZINES TO COLLEGE STUDENTS
The Magazine Publishers of America is sponsoring a program that will
provide free online magazine subscriptions to college students in an
effort to draw them into magazine readership. Magazine publishers have
long dealt with distribution problems for college students, who
typically change addresses frequently. At the same time, publishers are
working to understand how digital delivery fits into the larger picture
of magazine readership. During the program, students at five
institutions will have the option of subscribing to a particular
publication, a different one for each school. Students who opt in will
receive e-mails with links to the online version of the magazine, which
is identical to the printed version, including advertisements.
Organizers hope that after students graduate and settle down, they will
become subscribers and readers of the magazines' print version. Nina
Link, president and chief executive of the Magazine Publishers of
America, stressed that her organization believes that digital and print
versions are both viable but in different contexts. Other publishers
agreed. Jack Kliger, president and chief executive of Hachette
Filipacchi, said that each medium has advantages over the other but
that both are important.

NEW KIND OF HIGH SCHOOL OPENS IN PHILADELPHIA
The city of Philadelphia and Microsoft teamed up to create a new kind
of high school, one that its designers hope will usher in different
kinds of learning to better suit the needs of today's companies. About
170 students--mostly black kids from low-income families--make up the
first freshman class of the School of the Future. The school brims with
technology--students carry laptops instead of books, the entire
facility has wireless Internet access, teachers use interactive smart
boards--but it also takes a new approach to the structure of a school
day. School runs from 9:15 a.m. to 4:19 p.m., approximating a typical
office work day, and students have appointments with teachers rather
than strict class times. As they move through lessons, students'
computers monitor how much they are learning and adjust lessons
accordingly. To graduate from the school, which is expected to have 750
students eventually, students must apply to college. Doug Lynch, vice
dean of the Graduate School of Education at The University of
Pennsylvania, said the project is interesting in that it breaks such
new ground but noted that "we have to be careful because you're
messing with kids' lives."

LOS ALAMOS LAB COMMISSIONS FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTER

[I don't know if I mentioned it here, but I have been predicting
that game chips would show up in supercomputers, simply because
they have so much bang for the buck]


The U.S. Department of Energy has commissioned IBM to build a
supercomputer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico that
will be as much as four times faster than the Blue Gene/L at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, currently the world's fastest
supercomputer. The new computer, dubbed Roadrunner, will use 16,000
standard processors and 16,000 so-called cell processors, which were
designed for Sony's PlayStation 3 game console. Because each cell
consists of eight individual processors, Roadrunner will be able to
achieve its speed using far fewer processors than comparable systems.
Other efforts have focused on using the power of cell processors to
solve large computing problems. Researchers at Stanford University in
August said they were working on a system that would allow PS3 game
consoles to function as a large, distributed-computing system.
According to the researchers, 10,000 game consoles would provide
roughly 1 petaflop of processing--the amount expected from Roadrunner.
The Stanford researchers said they hope eventually to recruit 100,000
game consoles to their project.

COLLEGE PRESIDENTS EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR OPEN ACCESS
The presidents of 53 liberal arts colleges have signed a letter
supporting the Federal Public Research Access Act, which would require
free and public access to research funded by the federal government.
Librarians have for years protested the steeply rising costs of
academic journals, noting that each year they can afford fewer of the
resources that students and faculty need. Supporters of the legislation
argue it would level the playing field for researchers and would
appropriately allow public access to publicly funded science.
Publishers of academic journals and the scholarly societies they
represent lambasted the legislation, saying it would undermine peer
review and the quality of the journals. Allan Adler of the Association
of American Publishers said the legislation is "short-sighted" and is
simply an attempt by librarians to obtain for free what they have
always paid for. The academic community, however, seems inclined to
disagree. The new letter of support from college presidents follows
similar support in July from the provosts of 25 research universities.
According to the new letter, which was drafted by a library group at
Oberlin College, the legislation would "democratize access to research
information" and would "benefit education, research, and the general public."

SOUTH KENT COLLEGE DISTRIBUTES IPODS
Students at South Kent College in Dover, England, will be given free
iPod Nanos that school officials hope will be used to listen to missed
lectures. Josh Coleman, assistant principal at the school, said that
the idea to provide iPods was based on examples in the United States
and Australia for how to foster new kinds of learning. He said he does
not expect attendance in classes to decline as a result. Some critics
said the scheme is merely a gimmick to attract students. Coleman
rejected that notion, saying the program will provide long-term
benefits to the institution. Nick Seaton, chairman of an organization
called Campaign for Real Education, characterized the iPods as bribes,
saying they undercut the idea that education is valuable. "Youngsters
should want to take the courses for their own sake if they are
worthwhile," he said. Giving out iPods to students is "a scandalous
waste of taxpayers' money," Seaton concluded.

DIGITAL DIVIDE REMAINS FOR STUDENTS
According to new data from the National Center for Education
Statistics, despite an overall increase in computer usage among
students, minorities continue to trail in their levels of Internet
access. The data, gathered from a 2003 survey, indicate that while
two-thirds of white students use the Internet, just 47 percent of black
students and 44 percent of Hispanic students do so. Due to increasing
computer access at schools, the gaps are lower during the school day.
At home, however, 54 percent of white students have Internet access,
compared to 27 percent of black and 26 percent of Hispanic students.
Mark Lloyd, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress,
expressed strong concern about the persistence of the digital divide.
"This creates incredible barriers for minorities," he said,
"[narrowing] their ability to even think about the kind of work they
can be doing."

GOOGLE LAUNCHES NEWS ARCHIVE SEARCH
Google is launching a new service that provides access to archives of
news articles from several major organizations. With the new Google
News Archive Search, users can perform keyword searches and see
excerpts from the results of articles provided by participating
publishers. From there, users can click through to the archival
version, typically hosted by the content owners, where the full text of
the article is available, sometimes for free and other times for a fee.
Participating in the service are the New York Times, the Washington
Post, the Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, LexisNexis, and others.
The content in the service in some cases dates back to the 19th century
and earlier, giving researchers access to sources that formerly would
have been difficult or impossible to locate. Danny Sullivan, editor in
chief of SearchEngineWatch, said the service could provide new revenue
for news organizations through fees for archival stories.

CONSORTIUM ANNOUNCES FREE WI-FI FOR SILICON VALLEY
A group of companies calling itself Silicon Valley Metro Connect has
announced a vast Wi-Fi network covering large portions of Silicon
Valley. The network will be the result of a solicitation from the San
Mateo County Telecommunications Authority, an agency representing
cities and counties in Silicon Valley. The agency selected Metro
Connect's bid for the project, though the deal allows cities to work
with other contractors. Metro Connect includes IBM, Cisco Systems,
Azulstar Networks, and the nonprofit SeaKay. The network, which is
expected to begin operating as early as next year, will offer speeds of
up to 1 Mbps for free or higher speeds for a fee. Nearly 2.5 million
residents of an area covering 1,500 square miles will be able to access
the network outside, though they will need to purchase boosters to use
the signal inside homes or offices.

*HEADLINE NEWS AVOIDED BY MOST OF THE MAJOR U.S. MEDIA


*QUOTATION OF THE WEEK

"It is a part of the acceptance of the rule of law that the courts
will be able to exercise jurisdiction over the executive.
Otherwise the conduct of the executive is not defined and
restrained by law. It is because of that principle, that the USA,
deliberately seeking to put the detainees beyond the reach of the
law in Guantanamo Bay, is so shocking an affront to the principles
of democracy. That we disagree on this issue does not detract from
the fact that the USA is a close and staunch ally of the UK.
Without independent judicial control, we cannot give effect to the
essential values of our society. To give effect to our democratic
values needs the participation of executive, legislature, and
judiciary together. How well they do it, as in every endeavour,
depends on the quality of the individual decisions each branch of
the state takes. The ability to give effect to these values is not
just the morally correct position to take, though I believe it is
most certainly that. It is also a vital part of providing security
for our peoples."

Head of the British Judicary, with permission of Prime Minister
[Just this morning on the BBC]

/

History is replete with examples of such lopsided relationships
within nations or between one nation and another. Here in southern
Africa, there were cases of this nature in the former white-minority
led countries of Rhodesia and South Africa, and between these
countries and their majority-ruled neighbours. The minority
governments of the two countries were rich and militarily powerful
compared to their black subjects and the governments of their
majority-ruled neighbouring countries. It was, therefore, not
surprising that the governments of the two white-ruled states reacted
so arrogantly to the legitimate demands of their black populations
and the criticisms of their neighbouring states. They saw themselves
surviving indefinitely and comfortably, so long as they did enough to
extinguish the aspirations of their black populations and inflicted
painful-enough military punishments on their troublesome, black-ruled
neighbours. Needless to say, this was not to be.

Nelson Mandela


*STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer,
heard from many locales around the world, even those most
economically powerful and with the highest growth rates.



*DOUBLESPEAK OF THE WEEK

Dick Cheney on the Sunday morning news program Meet The Press:

About the Iraq War being the proper response to 9/11:

"If we had it to do over again, we'd do exactly the same thing."

"Exactly the same thing?" replied host tim Russert, giving V.P.
Cheney a graceful way out.

"Yes, sir," was Cheney's reply.

Later in the same program he said he would do things differently.

/

President Bush also rang the same note when he said
about doing the right thing:  "I am often asked why
we are in Iraq when Saddam Hussein was not responsible
for the 9/11 attacks, the answer is that the regime
of Saddam Hussein was a clear threat."

This literally only days after gov't reports that there
was no connection, no weapons of mass destruction, etc.



*PREDICTIONS OF THE WEEK

Iraq will continue to be a quagmire, simply because
there is no plan, and never was, just like Korea in
1950 and Viet Nam in in the 1960's and 1970's.

The Iraq War will be shown to already have cost $1T.

9/11 will be shown to have already cost $1 Trillion, too.


*ODD STATISTICS OF THE WEEK

While al this was going on, the number of military deaths
in Iraq and Afghanistan passed 3,000, more than 9/11.

*

By the way, for those interested, the official U.S. population
estimates just passed 299 million, though many say estimations
of this nature leave out as much as 5% of the population, with
the obvious exclusion of the 11-12 million immigrant workers
now being mentioned so much in the news.

Still hoping for more statistical updates and additional entries.
[This one is getting a little out of date, as the US population
is obviously no longer 6% of the world.  In fact, rounding to the
nearest percent, the US will soon fall from 5% to 4%.]

"If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same,
it would look something like the following. There would be:

57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both North and South America
  8 Africans
  52 would be female
  48 would be male
  70 would be non-white
  30 would be white
  70 would be non-Christian
  30 would be Christian
   6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth
   and all 6 would be from the United States
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
  1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
  1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
  1 would own a computer [I think this is now much greater]
  1 would be 79 years old or more.

Of those born today, the life expectancy is only 63 years,
but no country any longer issues copyrights that are sure
to expire within that 63 year period.

I would like to bring some of these figures more up to date,
as obviously if only 1% of 6 billion people owned a computer
then there would be only 60 million people in the world who
owned a computer, yet we hear that 3/4 + of the United States
households have computers, out of over 100 million households.
Thus obviously that is over 1% of the world population, just in
the United States.

I just called our local reference librarian and got the number
of US households from the 2004-5 U.S. Statistical Abstract at:
111,278,000 as per data from 2003 U.S Census Bureau reports.

If we presume the saturation level of U.S. computer households
is now around 6/7, or 86%, that is a total of 95.4 million,
and that's counting just one computer per household, and not
counting households with more than one, schools, businesses, etc.

I also found some figures that might challenge the literacy rate
given above, and would like some help researching these and other
such figures, if anyone is interested.

BTW, while I was doing this research, I came across a statistic
that said only 10% of the world's population is 60+ years old.

This means that basically 90% of the world's population would
never benefit from Social Security, even if the wealthy nations
offered it to them free of charge.  Then I realized that the US
population has the same kind of age disparity, in which the rich
live so much longer than the poor, the whites live so much longer
than the non-whites.  Thus Social Security is paid by all, but is
distributed more to the upper class whites, not just because they
can receive more per year, but because they will live more years
to receive Social Security.  The average poor non-white may never
receive a dime of Social Security, no matter how much they pay in.
