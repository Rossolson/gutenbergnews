Buying books would be a good thing if one could also buy the
time to read them in: but as a rule the purchase of books is
mistaken for the appropriation of their contents.
-Arthur Schopenhauer, philosopher (1788-1860)

Using Project Gutenberg Etexts saves you enough time
to read a major portion of the book, as opposed to
actually going to physically hunt up the books, and,
hee hee, our books are never out of stock. . . .

***

When we send out the Project Gutenberg Newsletters, we
have already posted all the files listed in that index
listing we include in the Newsletters [excepting those
marked as "reserved," of course.

While our human cataloguers and indexers of course can
not had time to add them to their files yet, computers
will already have them listed. . .and thus you will be
able to download them, literally only one second after
we have started to post them, even before our own post
of them has been completely uploaded. . . !

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:
http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02
or
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02

Or 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91, 90.

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.

***

We have produced approximately 500 new Etexts in 2001,
for an average of 100 per each of the 5 monthly Newsletters.
[This would yield a total of 1200 total new Etexts for 2001]
[We would need to do 83 1/3 Etext per month for 1000 per year]
[Last month we did 81 new Etexts]

However, things are slowing down somewhat. . . .

Here are the 18 new Etexts we have done since last Wednesday:
[18 per week for a year would be a total of 936 for the year]

COPYRIGHT BATTLE ERUPTS OVER E-BOOKS
Bertelsmann's Random House and startup Rosetta Books will square off this
week in a court battle that could have as much influence on the future of
publishing as Napster had on the music industry. Random House is pursuing
its claim that authors who sign over the rights to publish their works in
"book form" before the existence of the Internet also granted the rights
for e-publications. Rosetta Books had contracted directly with a group of
authors, including William Styron and Kurt Vonnegut, for the electronic
publishing rights to some of their Random House titles, which it says are
not included in the print contracts. E-books are poised to become the third
branch of online copyright disputes, which are already causing upheaval in
the music and film industries. The music industry has pressured Napster to
add filters to its popular file-sharing service, and the film industry last
week announced plans to go after Gnutella users who traffic in pirated
movies. (CNet News.com 6 May 2001)
