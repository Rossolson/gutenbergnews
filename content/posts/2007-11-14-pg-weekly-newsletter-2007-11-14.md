HOW TO TURN E-BOOKS INTO MP3, AND HOW TO LISTEN TO THEM
                             by Nick Hodson

One of the easiest ways to start creating MP3 files of e-books is to visit
NextUp.com and download their TextAloud 2 product, which you can use for a
while as a free download.TextAloud 2 Logo The product costs $29.95. You can
pay by various methods including Paypal. Then you will need a "voice". Because
I am British I use "Graham" from Acapela. Voices from this manufacturer cost
$35. There are lots more voices that you can hear samples of at that website.
Male, female, US, Australian, Indian, just take your personal choice.

RealSpeak voices cost $45. AT&T Natural Voices generally cost $35. A pair of
NeoSpeech voices cost $35. The larger the file-size of a "voice" the better
it should be, because it will have the pronunciation of more words than a
smaller sized voice, and it should also have rules for deciding between the
pronunciation of the roughly 120 words in the English language that have two
or more different pronunciations. If there is a choice between 8 kHz
(kilohertz) and 16 kHz voices take the 16 kHz, because this number indicates
the sampling rate per second. Your computer comes complete with some voices
that will work with TextAloud, but they are not as good as, say, the Acapela
voices. When you are listening to a good, modern, voice, it is hard to believe
it is not a real person that is speaking. Any voice you buy should be
described as SAPI5, as that is the most modern standard.

Now take an e-book, such as one you have downloaded from Project Gutenberg.
The simplest ones to do are the ones that have the word "Chapter" or "CHAPTER"
at the start of each chapter. Sometimes you find e-books that have......

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
