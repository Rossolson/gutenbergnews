ANOTHER BATCH OF NEWSSCAN ARTICLES:

SOME STATES BALK AT MICROSOFT DEAL
Led by California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, at least half a dozen of
the 18 states involved in the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit plan to tell U.S.
District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly that they cannot support the
settlement agreement brokered with the U.S. Justice Department last week.
As written, "the agreement is full of loopholes and does little more than
license Microsoft to crush its competition," said Massachusetts Attorney
General Thomas Reilly. "This was thrust on the states at the last minute,
under enormous pressure, without enough time to review the details." If
even a few states reject the settlement, they could force the case back
into court to determine a remedy. Unless Microsoft agrees to further
concessions, California, Wisconsin, Iowa, Connecticut, Kansas, Maryland,
Florida, Massachusetts, West Virginia and the District of Columbia are
favoring opposition, according to states' lawyers. Illinois, Ohio, North
Carolina, New York and Utah are seen as likely to join the settlement, with
the remaining states' positions unknown. (Wall Street Journal 6 Nov 2001)

NAPSTER ALTERNATIVE USE UP 20%
The use of Napster-like peer-to-peer music file-sharing sites like Kazaa,
MusicCity and Grokster rose 20% during the month of October, signaling U.S.
Internet users' insatiable demand for digital music and video downloads.
All three sites use software licensed from FastTrack, an Amsterdam-based
technology company, and share the same network. "The growth of the
FastTrack network continues to be astounding," says a Webnoize analyst.
"During the last four months the number of users typically logged on has
risen by 480%, and in November will likely surpass the 1.57 million
simultaneous users that Napster... enjoyed at its peak... As higher
awareness translates into higher usage, the FastTrack network may
ultimately become many times larger than Napster ever was." Meanwhile, a
recent Jupiter Media Metrix survey shows that song-swapping has declined in
Europe over the same period. According to the report, music downloads are
down by 50% in Europe since February, the point at which Napster usage hit
its zenith. (Reuters 5 Nov 2001)

HONORARY SUBSCRIBER: FRIEDRICH SCHILLER
      Today's Honorary Subscriber is the German dramatist and poet
Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805), whose plays, along with those of Goethe,
established a theatrical renaissance in Germany known as "Weimar
Classicism."
      Schiller's father was in the employ of Duke Karl Eugen of
Wirttemberg, and at age 13 Schiller entered the Duke's military academy,
where the Duke insisted he study law. He later switched to medicine, and
when he was 21 he was appointed to the Duke's Stuttgart regiment as a
military surgeon. Repelled by the tyranny of the Duke and his schooling,
Schiller was attracted by the revolutionary spirit of the time, he
expressed his troubled feelings in a play, "The Robbers," which had a
successful run in Mannheim, but so angered the Duke that he was placed
under military arrest and ordered to cease writing plays.
      Schiller fled the Duchy, relocating in Mannheim where he began work
in earnest as a dramatist. Later he moved to Leipzig and then Weimar,
eventually settling in Jena. During this period he continued to write
successful plays and expanded his literary output to include poetry and
historical writing.  His poem, "Ode to Joy" was later used by Beethoven in
the composer's "Ninth Symphony," and his "History of the Revolt of the
United Netherlands " led to his appointment as Professor of History at the
University of Jena. Other writings for which Schiller is noted are the
treatises he wrote on aesthetics, foremost among them being "On the
Aesthetic Education of Man."
      In 1790, he met and married Charlotte Von Lengefeld, with whom he had
two sons and two daughters. In 1794 a chance meeting with Goethe led to a
lifelong friendship and literary collaboration. Under Goethe's influence,
Schiller resumed his playwriting, which he had neglected for some years in
favor of his other writings. He now undertook to compose his most mature
dramas including "Mary Stuart" (1800), "The Maid of Orleans" (1801), and
"William Tell" (1804.)
      In 1799 Schiller re-settled in Weimar, partly to be near Goethe who
was director of the regional theater located there. Together they made the
Weimar Theatre one of the most prestigious theatrical houses in Europe.
      Schiller was only forty-six years old when he died of the
tuberculosis that had plagued him for many years.

MAILBAG: THE WORLD AS WE FIND IT

FREE SPEECH 1, TRADE SECRETS 0
http://www.newsscan.com/cgi-bin/findit_view?table=newsletter&id=4863
In response to the statement from the DVD industry rep that "Beyond our
case, if this decision becomes the law of the United States, all trade
secrets are unconstitutional," I can only respond "Well, duh!" The court
argued that the legal threshold for prior restraint of free speech is very
high, and businesses are crazy if they think their economic interests trump
the Constitution. I am very pleased to see some common sense come from the
courts on this issue, and hope the trend continues. (Conn McQuinn)

NUMERATION
http://www.newsscan.com/cgi-bin/findit_view?table=honorary_subscriber&id=468
In Arabic script, numerals don't obviously resemble ours. For example, "5"
resembles an inverted card-deck heart. But they are indeed the source of
our numerals today. Western scribes wrote the original Arabic numerals in
vertical columns, as on a scroll. When western script evolved from vertical
alignment to horizontal alignment, scribes correspondingly rotated the
Arabic numbers 90 degrees. For example, in written Arabic the numeral for
"7" resembles a Latin "V". Rotate "V" 90 degrees counterclockwise, so that
the cusp is at the right. The resemblance to "7" becomes obvious. The other
Arabic numerals evolved similarly. In several cases, the orientation became
reversed, such as for 3. A source about the evolution of the original
Arabic numerals to western script is
www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html.

COOKIE CUTTING
http://www.newsscan.com/cgi-bin/findit_view?table=newsletter&id=4833
The AOL client on the users desktop communicates with the AOL servers using
a proprietary protocol and is therefore capable of recording, silently and
invisibly to the user, whatever the user is doing. This however has nothing
to do with cookies or what can be done with cookies. An apt analogy for an
unwary surfer might be the stickers that some travelers accumulate on their
luggage but with the following differences: Cookies can last forever;
cookies can be a multitude potentially recording every click, and thus
every action by the surfer over an indefinite time and (cyber) space;
cookies and particularly their import are not easily visible to the person
carrying them; cookies and their import is easily visible to those who
plant them and who can relate them to other information. Those who are
concerned with their privacy are concerned with the capabilities of those
that would collect data, not their expressed intent. (John A. Martin)
