So far we have sent out 15 million eBooks via SnailMail!

We currently have access to a dozen DVD burners. If you have a DVD burner and are interested in lending a hand, please email Aaron Cannon (cannona@fireantproductions.com).

We can set you up with images, or snail you these DVD's for you to copy. You can either snail them directly to readers whose addresses we can send you, or you can do a stack of these and send the whole box back for reshipping.

We can also reimburse you for supplies and postage if you wish.

Please note that we can only use DVD's which are burnt in the DVD-R format, as we have had some compatibility issues with the DVD+R format.
