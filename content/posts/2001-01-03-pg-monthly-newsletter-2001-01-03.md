Be sure ALL address are bcc'd. . . .

This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, January 3, 2001

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*


!!!!!This is Book Month. . .please put some of our Etexts on floppies
or CDs and give them to people who aren't yet into Etexts or the Net!


Prairienet is going down in one hour, as I am writing this, so please
accept my apologies for any rough edges, I haven't slept much, and am
in a big hurry, after posting 10 Etexts already this morning. . . .

Please note, the prairienet.org system will be down January 3, for an
assortment of upgrades and changes, so please be sure to email me at:

hart@pobox.com, and/or hart@archive.org and/or hart@prairienet.org
I also have a new address:  hart@spaceship.com I will be trying out,
and it seems to be the best one for a backup email site. . .Michael

If you don't hear back from me within a few days, always resend!!!
Prairienet may be pretty flaky for the entire coming week. . . .



Headline News:

no email addresses came with the following copyright research requests:

Tolstoi clearance from Mike S. . .and several others I was finally able
to track down. . . .

**!!!PLEASE include your email address when you send us snail mail!!!**


Subject: Re: Donations from other countries.
You must include a disclaimer saying that our tax exempt status
applies only within the United States.


For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:

http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02
or
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02

You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.


With 3100 eTexts online it now takes an average of 100,000,000 readers
gaining a nominal value of $3.23 from each book, for Project Gutenberg
to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion Dollars] in books.

*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

This "cost" is down from $3.33 when we had 3000 Etexts on December 6
This "cost" is down from $3.40 when we had 2870 Etexts on October 18/Nov 1
This "cost" is down from $3.48 when we had 2870 Etexts on September 3
This "cost" is down from $3.55 when we had 2820 Etexts on August 16
This "cost" is down from $3.60 when we had 2775 Etexts on August 2
This "cost" is down from $3.70 when we had 2650 Etexts in July
This "cost" is down from $3.77 when we had 2650 Etexts in June
This "cost" is down from $3.92 when we had 2550 Etexts in May
This "cost" is down from $4.00 when we had 2500 Etexts in April

Can you imagine each one of thousands of books reduced by 77 cents???
Just from one spring to the next winter???

and there is no time limit,
so let's supply more books."

There is no end to the great things we can accomplish
if we don't worry about who gets the credit.  - Anon.

on FTP, and let the rest of the world mirror it ;)" - Linus Torvalds

"Life is no brief candle to me.  It is a sort of splendid
torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want
to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it
on to future generations."            George Bernard Shaw

We have posted a new translation of the New Testament of the Bible
(etext02/comed10.zip).  Volunteers skilled in HTML are needed to
create valid HTML code from existing code that may be found at
http://www.commonbible.com.  This is a significant task, as the
current HTML (produced by MS Word) needs to be edited carefully
so that it is completely valid according to the W3 validator,
http://validator.w3.org.  If you are interested in working on
one or more chapters of this project, please contact
Timothy Clontz &lt;teclontz@yahoo.com&gt;.


and


I still haven't been paid for some 24 months now, and hope to
be posting some suggestions on how we can work this out. . .I
will be posting these on a separate mailing list, so tell me
if you want to be on that list.  Make sure you get a confirm
message from the listserver next month.

John O. noticed Greg Newby had messed up filenames for Society's Child.
Greg Newby fixed them, and posted a new sochi-README.txt in etext02.

These entries from GUTINDEX.ALL are still almost
good:  12 becomes 22 in sochi22.wav, and underscores become
hyphens in the .mp3s.  The Lyrics entry stays the same.

FTC GETS COMPLAINTS ABOUT AMAZON.COM'S NEW PRIVACY POLICY
Privacy groups Junkbusters and the Electronic Privacy Information
Center (EPIC) are raising complaints about changes Amazon.com has
made to its consumer privacy policy and have asked the FTC to
investigate the matter. The policy changes allow Amazon.com to
share consumer data with third parties, according to the two
groups. Indeed, Amazon.com announced in August that it was
changing its policy so that it would have the option of selling
its customer data as assets if it ever went bankrupt. At the
time, Amazon.com also removed a feature from its Web site that
allowed customers to opt out of sharing their data with other
companies. Nonetheless, Amazon.com insists its privacy policy is
stronger than ever because the old policy permitted the company
to sell or rent personal data. "The privacy policy is absolutely
stronger now than it was before," said Amazon.com's Patty Smith.
Junkbusters and EPIC say that the FTC should force Amazon.com to
install technology that would give consumers the option of
removing their personal data from Amazon.com's site. The groups
are also calling for Amazon.com to tell customers what data is
being shared with other companies.

COMPUTER SECURITY EXPERTS QUESTION INTERNET WIRETAPS
The furor surrounding the FBI's Carnivore e-mail monitoring system
intensified after a high-profile group of computer security
experts released a report that raises new privacy and legal
questions about the Internet wiretapping system. The report also
concluded that a Justice Department-sponsored review of Carnivore
by the Illinois Institute of Technology's Research Institute was
limited in nature and "simply cannot support a conclusion that
Carnivore is correct, safe, or always consistent with legal
limitations." The group of security experts said that the Illinois
review failed to conduct a true search for programming flaws. The
Illinois review was also scrutinized by the Privacy Foundation,
which concluded that Carnivore has "technical deficiencies" that
must be addressed. The head of the Illinois review, Henry H.
Perritt Jr., agrees that Carnivore should be subjected to periodic
review and that wiretapping law must be updated to address digital
technologies.

COMMUNITY COLLEGES FIGHT TO USE '.EDU' INTERNET ADDRESSES
The government established rules that permit the .edu top level
domain to be used by "four-year, degree-granting colleges and
universities," thereby officially keeping community colleges out
of that domain. Wanting access to .edu domain names, the
American Association of Community Colleges has increased
pressure, writing letters to both the U.S. Department of Commerce
and Network Solutions (NSI). The Department of Commerce letter,
written by association President George R. Boggs, expressed
community colleges' frustration and recommended that management
of the .edu TLD be handled by EDUCAUSE. A new .edu administrator
is currently in the process of being chosen, and that
administrator will have close connections with the higher
education community and would be asked to "work with" colleges to
create .edu policies that are better for community colleges, says
the Commerce Department. Locating a new .edu administrator is a
top priority, and the decision should be made quickly, with the
administrator taking over the .edu domain by December 2001,
Commerce says.

TRYING TO MEET IT NEEDS
Schools that offer IT training are struggling to keep up with the
growing demand for their courses. Huge enrollments are forcing
schools to add more courses, hire more instructors, and seek
additional classroom space. In addition, many schools are
turning to online learning as a way of accommodating more
students without needing more physical classrooms. Northern
Virginia Community College's (NVCC) Loudon Campus says it
oversubscribed IT classes this year by assuming incorrectly that
the usual number of students would drop the courses. The college
now has large waiting lists for many IT courses, including its
Java certificate program and Java script classes. NVCC says the
online classes it began offering last year have helped meet
demand. Still, NVCC needs more classroom space, because its
current lab space is full every day until 10 p.m. Meanwhile, the
professional education program at George Mason University's
School of Information Technology and Engineering, which teaches
skills such as Java, Web development, and C++, is also expanding
rapidly. The school has grown from one instructor and six
courses two years ago to five instructors and 12 courses today
and is planning to expand even further.

BOSTON UNIVERSITY LOOKS TO KNOWLEDGENET
Boston University's Corporate Education Center (BUCEC) partnered
with KnowledgeNet to provide online IT training for students.
With the demand for IT workers continuing to grow, BUCEC needed a
way to make classes more convenient for working adults. "We
recognize that for our clients, time is money so we needed a way
for them to learn on their own time, wherever they wanted,
whenever they wanted," says BUCEC director Andy Kelley. BUCEC
licensed KnowledgeNet Live, Interactive, and Express to provide
online solutions for its students in areas such as Cisco,
CompTIA, and Microsoft. Live offers synchronous online courses
led by an instructor, while Express plays back the synchronous
class. Interactive is an asynchronous online learning solution
that lets students learn at their own speed. Many universities
are partnering to provide IT training, says KnowledgeNet CEO Tom
Graunke. Universities want to prepare students for high-tech
careers, but often need a partner to provide content and skilled
instructors, Graunke says.

STUDENT AID ON THE WEB
Prospective college students can apply for federal financial aid
through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), a
service of the Education Department. That application has been
online for four years now, and director of application processing
Jeanne Saunders says online usage has increased every year. The
department forecasts 10.2 million applicants this year, and
Saunders estimates that applicants will file 2 million online.
However, that prediction may be an underestimate, as 1.5 million
applications had been filed online as of August. Saunders says
the department was aware of the advantage to students and parents
that an online application would bring. FAFSA online illustrates
two aspects of e-government: it is a new avenue of service that
coincides with but does not eliminate the original, and it offers
electronic data continuously through a tie-in to the department's
mainframe. Hyperlinks on the site provide help to students, whose
time required to process applications has dropped thanks to the
online option.

FBI SPLIT OVER E-MAIL SURVEILLANCE RULES
Law enforcement officials have long held that a 1986 law allowing police to
record phone numbers by someone tied to a criminal investigation permits
them to secretly copy e-mail addresses in messages sent to people involved
in criminal probes, but a newly disclosed e-mail message suggests there is
internal dissension over the legality of such "pen traps": "We have agents
that would like to use a pen for e-mail, but our [chief division counsel]
thinks that we can only use a pen to get the telephone number dialed by the
modem," one agent wrote in the Feb. 14 e-mail. "I don't think we in the
field have a grasp of how the existing telecommunications laws apply to
computer communications." Highlighting the depth of confusion over the
issue within law-enforcement circles, the agent noted that this legal
opinion came from the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center,
which includes the bureau's top computer-crime experts in Washington. The
uncertainty brings into question the legality of using Carnivore, the FBI's
e-mail "sniffing" software, which has been justified under the 1986 law
that covers any device that "records or decodes electronic or other
impulses, which identify the numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted" and
that is attached to a telephone line. "Carnivore is not attached to a
telephone line and does not obtain a number dialed," says Philip L. Gordon,
a lawyer with the Privacy Foundation, who notes that privacy protections
for e-mail addresses should be greater than those for phone numbers.
"They're clearly different." (Wall Street Journal 7 Dec 2000)

E-BOOKS -- A NEW LITERACY?
"E-books are not just another imprint," said McGraw-Hill VP Bob Bolic.
"They represent a new literacy." That comment came as e-books headlined the
opening of this year's BookTech West conference, where exhibitors showcased
their latest e-reading devices, as well as digital rights management and
e-commerce tools. While panel participants generally agreed that the key to
e-book success was universal standards and uniform business models, others
stressed the need for industry-wide cooperation. "If e-books take off, it
won't just be about the size of the screen or the clarity of type," said
Bolic. "It will be about publishers mastering the skills of versioning
(creating and managing different versions of the same document." (Wired.com

Y2K BUG BELATEDLY BEDEVILS NORWAY'S TRAINS
The Y2K glitch hit Norway's national railroad company a year later than
expected, when none of the company's 16 new airport express trains or 13
high-speed long-distance Signatur trains would start on the morning of Dec.
31. The company performed a quick work-around by resetting the computers to
Dec. 1, 2000, and the trains were able to start up on ignition. "We didn't
think of trying out the date 31/12/00," says a spokesman for Adtranz, the
German producer of the new trains. "Now we have one month to find out what
went wrong so we can fix the problem for good." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 1
