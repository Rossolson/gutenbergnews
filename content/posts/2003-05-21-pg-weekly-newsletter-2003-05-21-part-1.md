We are hoping we can make it from 100 to 10,000 in exactly 10 years. . .!
December 10, 1993 was the actual date of #100, 10,000 this December 10th?
Without any increase in this rate of growth:  1,000,000 on Dec. 10, 2013!


[The Newsletter is now being sent in three sections, so you can directly
go to the portions you find most interesting:  1.  Founder's Comments,
2. News, Notes & Queries, and  3. Weekly eBook Update Listing.]

Note:  Due to circumstances beyond her control, Alice Wood, your regular
newsletter editor, will not be sending out the newsletter today; so you

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT, PROOFERS AND SCANNER TYPES

We need a volunteer near Chicago to help feed books to our newest
super-scanner. . .we have a stack of 200 waiting, and just cannot
stay away to feed them in 24/7.

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can
help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!


Charles Franks
9030 W. Sahara Ave. #195
Las Vegas, NV 89117


We will also have this
new address in Chicago!


Charles Aldarondo
701 Riverside Drive
Park Ridge, IL 60068


Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

charlz@lvcablemodem.com

***

David R. &lt;mr_der@hotmail.com&gt; is looking for a copy of:
M. P. Cushing's "Baron D'Holbach" (1914)
1971 reprint is not good for this purpose.

***

From: Miranda van de Heijning &lt;m_vandeheijning@yahoo.com&gt;
I don't have a scanner and cannot undertake any large
projects myself, but I would like to volunteer as a proofreader.
I would like get in touch with Dutch-speaking volunteers.

Statistical Review

In the 20 weeks of this year, we have produced 1278 new eBooks.
It took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our FIRST 1278 eBooks!!!

         That's 20 WEEKS as Compared to 27 YEARS!!!


The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of
production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,
starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 1st was
was the first Wednesday of 2003, and thus ended the production
year of 2002 and began the production year of 2003.

With 8,021 eBooks online as of May 21, 2003 it now takes an average
of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.25 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000
[One Trillion Dollars] in books.

100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world's population!

This "cost" is down from about $1.91 when we had 5236 eBooks A Year Ago

Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing $.66 less a year later???
Or. . .would this say it better?
Can you imagine 7,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???

INTERNET FILTERING BILL STALLED
An attempt in Oregon to require libraries to install filtering software to
protect children from explicit content on the Internet has stalled in
committee. Defending the bill against charges that it violates
Constitutional protections for freedom of speech, attorney James
Leuenberger argues: "The government clearly can decide on limits of what it
can or cannot say. To the extent the library wants to accept funding from
the state, the state should have the ability to tell the library what it
should or should not express." Connie Bennett, president of the Oregon
Library Association and director of the Eugene Public Library, says the
bill is "an unfunded mandate." (AP/USA Today 21 May 2003)

W3C ADOPTS POLICY ON PATENTS
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved a policy on patents that
requires all those who participate in the development of a W3C
recommendation must license essential claims on a royalty-free basis. It
also requires W3C members to make disclosures on patents they own and
requests that anyone else who sees technical drafts share their knowledge
of patents which may be essential. At the same time, the policy suggests a
process for handling unexpected patent claims that are inconsistent with
the terms of the W3C Patent Policy. In that instance, the W3C will convene
a Patent Advisory Group, which may then recommend: a legal analysis of the
patent, the removal of the patented feature, or cessation of work in that
area altogether. The W3C's efforts to create a patent policy have been
contentious since it first released its Patent Policy Framework Draft in
2001, says Daniel Weitzner, chair of the Patent Policy Working Group, who
cautioned technology companies against trying to exploit the patent
exception process. "Anyone who thinks that's going to be an easy way to
squeeze fees out of Web standards I think is mistaken," says Weitzner.

PRIVACY ADVOCATES DOUBT PENTAGON PROMISES ON SPYING
The Pentagon has changed the name of its planned anti-terrorist
surveillance systems, but critics say the fundamental program remains the
same and would risk violating citizens' privacy if fully implemented. Now
renamed the Terrorist Information Awareness program (from Total Information
Awareness), the system would broaden government surveillance activities to
encompass passport applications, visas, work permits, driver's licenses,
car rentals and airline ticket purchases as well as databases including
vast amounts of personal information, such as financial, education, medical
and housing and identification records. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a major
opponent of the TIA, says, "What most Americans don't know is that the laws
that protect consumer privacy don't apply when the data gets into
government's hands. Lawfully collected information can include anything,
medical records, travel, credit card and financial data." Testing of the
system is already underway, raising privacy advocates' concerns about
"false positives" based on erroneous data. "If TIA is relying on personal
information contained in databases to determine whether someone is a
suspect, what recourse does that person have whose information has been
entered incorrectly?" says a spokeswoman for the Free Congress Foundation,
which estimates that an error rate as small as .10% could result in more
than 30,000 Americans wrongly being investigated as terrorists.

NEW YORK AUTHORITIES ARREST BUFFALO SPAMMER
Authorities in New York have arrested Howard Carmack, the so-called
"Buffalo Spammer," on charges of identity theft in connection to a spam
ring Carmack operated. Last week EarthLink won a $16 million judgment
against Carmack as well as an injunction preventing him from sending
further spam. Carmack is accused of stealing identities and setting up
nearly 350 EarthLink accounts, from which he sent or helped other send
hundreds of millions of unsolicited messages. New York Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer said Carmack is the first to be prosecuted under the
state's recently enacted identity-theft law. Dave Baker of EarthLink
said, "Carmack's arrest demonstrates that spamming has both civil and
criminal consequences."

'BUFFALO SPAMMER' COULD GET UP TO SEVEN YEARS
Howard Carmack, the so-called "Buffalo Spammer," has become the first
person in New York state to be charged under the state's identity theft
laws. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 2-1/2 to 7 years in prison for
identity theft, forgery, criminal possession of forgery devices (in the
form of software used to create phony return addresses), and falsifying
business records. According to the indictment, Carmack "stole the
identities of innocent New Yorkers to spam millions of consumers throughout
New York and the nation." He is charged with using 343 stolen identities to
send his unsolicited bulk mailings through Earthlink accounts. An Earthlink
executive said the main impact of the arrest would be to demonstrate to
others the "very high cost of doing business" in spam.

RIAA SENDS AN APOLOGY TO PENN STATE
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) apologized this
week for a copyright warning notice that it sent in error to the
department of astronomy and astrophysics at Pennsylvania State
University. The RIAA uses automated programs to locate servers that are
distributing copyrighted files, which reported that one of the
department's servers was distributing files by the band Usher. The
server in question contained no such files, but the department has a
professor emeritus named Peter Usher. This, combined with the presence
of an MP3 file of a group of astronomers singing about a satellite, set
of the RIAA's crawler. According to the RIAA, all notices are checked
before they are sent out, but this one was not properly reviewed and
was sent in error. A statement from the RIAA said, "In this particular
instance, a temp employee made a mistake and did not follow RIAA's
established protocol." The RIAA also said that of the tens of thousands
of notices sent out, this was the first faulty notice discovered.

TEXAS EXPECTED TO ESTABLISH ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOL
The Texas Legislature will likely pass a bill to create a virtual
charter school to offer online courses to primary and secondary
students. The Texas Legislature, however, is currently deadlocked due
to partisan rivalry and a resulting lack of quorum. The proposed school
would be run by two state universities, which have yet to be selected.
Republican State Senator Florence Shapiro sponsored the legislation to
"provide flexibility and the use of available technology and online
resources to meet students' individual needs." A similar bill was
rejected due to concerns over the program's potential cost with
unlimited enrollment. The bill proposes a 2,000 student cap and will
cost roughly $9 million over two years. The state government created a
similar program two years ago that is administered by school districts
and enrolls 450 students. The University of Texas, which already runs a
virtual charter school without state assistance, would like to
participate in the state-run program to increase students' options,
according to Robert Bruce at the Austin campus's Distance Education Center.

13 STATES SUE OVER POP-UP ADS
Thirteen states have sued a New Jersey company that allegedly billed
Internet users who tried to close pop-up windows advertising p*rnographic
Web sites. The lawsuit maintains that Alyon Technologies automatically
connected users to its toll telephone number when they tried to close the
ads, and then charged them $5 a minute, resulting in bills ranging from $14
to more than $1,000. "The way this organization has allegedly been doing
business is illegal, irresponsible and an outrageous misuse of Internet
technology," said Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager. Joining
Wisconsin in the suit are California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois,
Kentucky, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, North Carolina, Nebraska, Texas and
West Virginia. (AP 16 May 2003)

U.S. CRACKS DOWN ON INTERNET FRAUD
The Justice Department has charged more than 130 people with perpetrating a
variety of Internet scams, as well as identity theft and failure to deliver
goods purchased online. The crackdown, dubbed Operation E-Con, involved
more than 90 investigations involving 89,000 victims whose losses totaled
at least $176 million. In one case, the suspects used a Web site to sell
more than $2 million worth of pharmaceutical drugs without any
prescriptions or physician involvement with the purchasers. In another
scam, about 400 men lost about $3,000 each when they sent money off in the
hope of winning the hand a Russian bride. Other scams promoted fraudulent
investment opportunities, Ponzi-type pyramid schemes and the illegal sale
of copyright-protected software, games and movies. Officials say they've
managed to recover about $17 million from alleged perpetrators.

MICROSOFT DISCOUNTS COULD RAISE EYEBROWS AT EU
Microsoft is offering hefty discounts on its products in an apparent effort
to undercut the cost advantage of Linux -- behavior that one European
antitrust lawyer says appears to violate European law. "If it's true, the
discounts would constitute an abuse," said competition law attorney Thomas
Vinje. Microsoft is under investigation by European regulators for possibly
abusing its dominance in the software market. The company said it had set
aside two funds as part of its strategy to combat Linux. One is set aside
for providing discounts to governments and the education sector, and the
other is earmarked for enabling the sales force to undersell competitors
peddling Linux software. "The primary objective is to make technology
available to customers at low prices," says a Microsoft spokesman.

VIDEOGAMES GO FROM WAR ROOM TO LIVING ROOM
The U.S. Army has been using videogames as part of its recruiting efforts
for the past year, but in coming months it will rely on a combat simulation
game to train squad leaders in real-life combat tactics. The game,
developed by Pandemic Studios, features lead characters heading up two
light infantry teams locked in a running firefight in a city that looks
vaguely Middle Eastern. Bad guys pop out from behind walls and zoom up in
pickup trucks outfitted with automatic weapons. "If you enroll in the army
of the future, you'll get your helmet, your gun and one of these discs,"
says a Pandemic game designer. "You have an Xbox -- they assume -- at
home." And for game enthusiasts not inclined to sign on the dotted line,
the commercial version of "Full Spectrum Warrior" is expected to be
available in early 2004 for the Xbox console. (Reuters 15 May 2003)

MICROSOFT SCOOPS UP UNIX LICENSE FROM SCO
Microsoft is buying the rights to SCO Group's Unix technology for an
undisclosed amount, in a move that will bolster SCO's controversial
campaign to demand royalties from users of the Linux operating software,
which SCO claims infringes on its Unix patents. Linux supporters have
demanded that SCO identify which parts of the code are duplicative, but SCO
says that doing that would allow programmers to cover up their
transgressions by rewriting the software. "That's like saying, 'show us the
fingerprints on the gun so you can rub them off,'" says SCO CEO Darl
McBride. Microsoft, which competes fiercely with both Linux and Unix, at
the same time has been a long-time backer of SCO and some in the Linux
community have speculated the software giant is secretly bankrolling SCO's
litigation to reduce the Linux threat. A Microsoft spokeswoman denied that
rumor. (Wall Street Journal 19 May 2003)

GROWTH IN RESIDENTIAL BROADBAND LEVELING OFF
The percentage of experienced Internet users who said they wish to upgrade
from dialup to broadband connections declined this year -- 43% compared to
53% last year -- in a development that signals the stabilization of the
residential broadband market. Pew Internet and American Life Project
director Lee Rainie said of the study's results: "The overall Internet
population has stopped growing in the United States. If there is no net
growth, you eventually run out of veteran users who have spent a couple of
years in dialup mode and want to move to broadband." The study also found a
slight shift among broadband users toward favoring cable modem connections.
In March, 67% connected via cable, compared with 63% a year earlier. In
contrast, 28% reported connecting via DSL, down from 34% the year before.
Although the percentage of DSL users dropped, overall growth is still up --
9 million users in March, up from 7 million. That compares with 21 million
cable modem users. Almost a third of Internet users now have broadband
connections -- up from 21% last March. (AP 19 May 2003)

ARBITRATION PLAINTIFF CAN NOW TELL DEFENDANT: 'SHOW ME THE E-MAIL'
Federal District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin has ruled that UBS Warburg
must search its archives and restore a number of e-mail messages the
company removed from its system after a former employee filed a suit
against the company for sexual discrimination and retaliatory dismissal.
The ruling sets a precedent that investment banks must pay for the
restoration of e-mail evidence if plaintiffs can show that it's relevant to
their cases. Arbitration lawyer Jacob H. Zamansky says, "The decision is
very significant and will help customers get crucial evidence for their
cases. As long as you can make a showing that the evidence you are asking
for is relevant, the banks must bear the cost for searching through the
e-mails." Up until now, investment banks have argued that the technical
difficulties (as well as the costs) involved in retrieving old e-mail
messages is prohibitive, and therefore a sufficient reason to dismiss
arbitration claims. (New York Times 17 May 2003)

[Up To A Million "Wiretaps" Per Year in the UK Alone???]
[Up To A Billion "Factoids" "Tapped" Per Year in the UK Alone?]

BRITISH DEBATE INTERNET SNOOPING
British privacy experts this week presented their estimates that
authorities in the United Kingdom make roughly one million requests
each year for data on Internet and phone usage, totaling perhaps one
billion individual pieces of information. The numbers were presented at
a public debate regarding proposals to expand governmental authority to
access such records. According to privacy experts, requests are made
for e-mail logs, personal information about customers, and telephone
billing data, including numbers called. Parliament has passed a
controversial act, the Regulatory of Investigatory Powers Act, which
collects all data-access rights under one piece of legislation. The
Home Office is currently investigating how to implement many of the
provisions of the act and is working with companies to reach agreement
on such issues as how long companies are required to preserve data. A
spokesman for the Home Office rejected the estimates of a million
information requests each year, saying the number is perhaps half that.

[Then Why Do the Universities Claim Copyright for
Files They Make From Public Domain Books???????]
[Could There Be A Double Standard?]

STUDENTS OBJECT TO ONLINE POSTING OF DISSERTATIONS
Some students and faculty at Ohio State University are objecting to a
policy that requires doctoral dissertations to be submitted
electronically and posted online. Opponents of the policy, many of whom
are in the English and history departments, argue that work posted
online is less likely to be accepted for publication later. Concerns
have also been raised over copyright issues for dissertations and the
perception of increased risk of plagiarism of the online dissertations.
University administrators said the policy reflects the institution's
responsibility for ensuring that academic work is "available to the
community at large." William A. T. Clark, associate dean of the
Graduate School, tried to allay plagiarism concerns by noting that
increased access to the dissertations may actually decrease plagiarism
because it is more likely to be detected. Students can apply for a one-
to three-year delay in the posting of their dissertations. Clark said,
however, that eventually all dissertations will be posted online
because the university has the right to do so.

STUDY PREDICTS SLOWING ADOPTION OF BROADBAND
A new study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project predicts
that, despite strong growth in recent years in the broadband market,
many users satisfied with current access will not upgrade to
broadband. An estimated 31 million U.S. households have high-speed
access, up 50 percent from a year ago, and a number of companies are
trying various approaches to encourage consumers to continue moving up
to broadband at a similar rate. The new study, however, indicates that
a large percentage of dial-up users are content to continue with their
existing service. Pew analyst John B. Horrigan said the good news is
that 13 percent of current dial-up users are ready to upgrade, but, he
said, the bad news is that "the pool of dial-up users most primed to
migrate to broadband ... is shrinking."

CHINESE MAN SENTENCED FOR ONLINE POSTINGS
Huang Qi has been sentenced by Chinese officials to five years in
prison for allowing users of his Web site to post articles about the
1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations in which demonstrators were killed
by the Chinese army. Huang did not write any of the articles. He began
the Web site as a clearinghouse for information on missing persons,
though many visitors to the site covered topics including alleged
human-rights violations and political issues. Huang, who was arrested
in June 2000, was the first person charged for Internet crimes in
China. Since then, Chinese authorities have detained others for similar
crimes. Huang's sentencing, for subversion, comes as the Chinese
government continues to seek a balance between promoting commercial
uses of technology while limiting political content and dissent.
