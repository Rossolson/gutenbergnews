## New eReader platform: proLibro

In April, Project Gutenberg met with the executives at CogniLore for a demo of their eReader platform called proLibro. Among the free eBooks available through the application were a selection of popular titles from Project Gutenberg. CogniLore showed how the content could be “brought to life” by interactive features and functionalities such as annotations, advanced searching, favourites, text to speech, and more.

CogniLore is excited to announce the release of the proLibro eReader trial software for the Microsoft Windows platform. This offers access to a selection of popular Project Gutenberg titles in an enhanced format. Share your feedback in a simple survey to shape the future of digital reading and stand a chance to win a $15 gift card! Your feedback on the tool will inform CogniLore’s technology roadmap and ensure that the product responds well to the needs of readers.

## Podcast about audiobooks and AI with Greg Newby

This newsletter has previously featured the work done in collaboration with Microsoft, MIT and other partners to create nearly 5000 free audiobooks using text-to-speech automation. Audiobooks from Project Gutenberg are described on the main page of <https://www.gutenberg.org>.

A new podcast describes this collaboration and also gives some background on Project Gutenberg's decades of effort to make literature more widely available. It also includes some of the background and motivations of Project Gutenberg's CEO (i.e., your humble newsletter editor).

The title of the podcast is, "Project Gutenberg expands access to literature by creating audiobooks with AI." It's hosted by Microsoft vice president Hayete Gallot.

You can listen and read a transcript here, as well as links to the podcast on major streaming services:
