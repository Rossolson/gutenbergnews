## Help with Social Media

From one of our great social media volunteers:

> "I wonder if someone is willing to back me up at Mastodon (@gutenberg\_org), only when it's needed. Mastodon is a fediverse platform similar to others social media. Only 2-3 posts a day are enough for this purpose. You can take a look at our account here <https://mastodon.social/@gutenberg_org>."

If you might be interested in helping out with Project Gutenberg's social media, you can respond to this newsletter directly and I'll put you in touch.


## AI Roles for Free eBooks

Have you noticed that most books now have summaries and browsing categories?

Project Gutenberg has been corresponding with innovators seeking to leverage today's new artificial intelligence (AI) systems to improve access to free literature, as well as increase human capabilities for benefitting from literature.

In 2022-2023, we partnered with Microsoft and others to make thousands of new audiobooks, leveraging AI techniques to improve the quality of the audio speech. You can find these via a section on the main page at <https://www.gutenberg.org/>.

In the September 2024 newsletter, we celebrated the addition of AI-derived browsing categories in the Bookshelves section of the website, making it easier to browse the collection. You can find those categories here:

> <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/>

We then worked with the same programmers to provide automated summaries of nearly every book in the collection. You can find those summaries on book landing pages. These summaries are intended to be helpful for people trying to decide what book to read, or to get an idea of what a book is about.

For example, here is the automated summary from book #1, the US Declaration of Independence (<https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1>):

>	"The Declaration of Independence of the United States of America" by Thomas Jefferson is a historic and foundational document penned in the late 18th century during the American Revolutionary period. This work primarily serves as a formal statement declaring the thirteen American colonies' separation from British rule, asserting their right to self-governance and independence. It encapsulates the philosophical underpinnings of democracy, highlighting fundamental human rights and the social contract between the government and the governed. The text begins with a powerful introduction that outlines the principles of equality and the unalienable rights of individuals to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It details the various grievances against King George III, illustrating how his actions have eroded the colonists' rights and justified their decision to seek independence. By listing these grievances, the document seeks to assert the colonies' legitimate claim to self-determination. The Declaration culminates in a solemn proclamation of independence, stating that the colonies are entitled to be free and independent states, free from British authority and capable of forming their own alliances, levying war, and engaging in commerce. The Declaration's closing emphasizes the signers' mutual pledge to support this cause, reinforcing the commitment of the colonists to their newly proclaimed liberty. (This is an automatically generated summary.)

If you spot errors in summaries, let us know. Summaries of most books are based only on the first 12,000 characters, because the costs would have been too high for if we included all of every book.

We have also been corresponding with another programmer seeking to instruct AI technologies to "read" books from Project Gutenberg, summarize them, and answer questions about them. We hope this might be described further in a future newsletter.
