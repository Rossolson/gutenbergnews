## Wikipedia links for books and authors

Thanks to Johannes and colleagues, Project Gutenberg now has around 11000 Wikipedia links added to book landing pages. For example, see:

>  <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10095>

When a Wikipedia article was found, an entry like this was added to the landing page: "Note: Wikipedia page about this book: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_of_the_Gods_and_Other_Tales>"

These Wikipedia pages were identified by carefully prompting an AI large language model. Previously, two other tasks were accomplished using similar methods.

First, we added bookshelf "browsing" categories to nearly every book in the Project Gutenberg collection. Second, we added a summary of the book, based on the first 12,000 or so characters.

The outcome of these months of work is that Project Gutenberg book landing pages now have additional information, to help people see what a book is about and decide whether to read it.


## Project Gutenberg is now on Bluesky

Project Gutenberg now has a presence on the Bluesky social media platform. This will have similar content to the Mastodon channel.
