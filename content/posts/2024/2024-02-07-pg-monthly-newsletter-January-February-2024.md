## Audiobook listening app

Gutenberg_AWP is a web app with enhanced accessibility features for
searching and listening to the audiobooks made possible by the
collaboration between Project Gutenberg, Microsoft and MIT.

From Gutenberg_AWP's author, Jim Luther:

> I was excited to learn this past fall about the collaboration to
convert 4,840 texts from the Project Gutenberg collection to
audiobooks. The audiobook project page (
https://marhamilresearch4.blob.core.windows.net/gutenberg-public/Website/index.html)
has all 4,840 books on it as well links to many popular podcast sites
where these audiobooks can be found and played.
> 
> In addition to all the laudable efforts by the collaboration, and the
generous participation of all the podcast providers, I thought I would
put together a web app that simplifies access, allows search by title
or author, and offers supportive playback features for those who may
find the podcast providers websites challenging to use. Supports
include text-to-speech feedback, multiple access methods, a simple
layout, and multiple foreground/background color schemes for enhanced
readability. The web app is still a work in progress, but it is
usable. I invite you to visit it for a try:
