## Give Freely browser extension to make donations to Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg has signed up with Give Freely to provide options for readers to generate donations of funds. Give Freely has a mission and philosophy that emphasizes transparency and accountability.

The Give Freely model is to install a browser extension. The extension automatically detects when you visit a participating online merchant. Then, if you make a purchase, a donation is channeled from that merchant to your selected charity. There is no cost to you. The browser extension also helps to find coupons in the online merchant sites.

The Give Freely browser extension can be disabled or uninstalled at any time.

It is available for Chrome and Edge for people in the US, Canada or the UK.  Additional browsers will be supported later in the summer.

Give Freely expects to release their extension for the Safari browser on iPhones and desktops by the end of June.

Give Freely does not work well with some ad-blockers.  It is suggested that you turn off ad-blockers before you activate any donations on partner stores.

More information, as well as links to install the browser extension, are online at <https://givefreely.com/>
