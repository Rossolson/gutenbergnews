## Scribble, for authors and aspiring authors

From Torrey Butler:

> In 2016, I began writing my first book. Foreign territory at the time
because I didn’t have a clue where to start. Everyone I sought out for
help either gave me the run around, tried to offer illegitimate
services, or flat out didn’t care to help me along the way. Despite
the adversity &amp; uncertainty, I pushed through, publishing my first
book 4-years later in 2020. This disparity is what millions of people
are faced with. In today’s literary world, many talented voices with a
story to tell are silenced, as they struggle to find the adequate
support where their voice can be heard and appreciated.

> Not anymore, because we are here to change that forever. I introduce
Scribble, an inclusive, user-friendly social platform where you can
write, publish, and market your book(s), connect directly with
readers, all within a supportive community. Our goal is to make book
publishing and book reading accessible to everyone. Your voice will be
heard and appreciated! Join us on the journey.

## Bookshelf "Browsing" categories

Visit <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/> to see some new browsing categories.

Bookshelves are hand-curated groupings of eBooks, which have not been updated since 2020. This means that many books do not have bookshelf categories. Volunteers Johannes & Alex developed an AI-based method for automatically assigning browsing categories to the entire Project Gutenberg collection.

These 64 categories are intended to be similar to what you would find when browsing a bookstore. Thanks to Johannes & Alex for this innovation for browsing the collection.


## Help Wanted

Got programming skills? Web development skills?

Can you help with finding problems in current Project Gutenberg eBooks, or figuring out problems when automatic conversion fails?

Project Gutenberg welcomes specific suggestions or fixes, including "pull requests" to our software.

You can find most of the code behind the Project Gutenberg website here:
>  <https://github.com/gutenbergtools>

It is intentional that we have very little dynamic content on <https://www.gutenberg.org/>. We use Javascript only to pre-fill the search box with suggestions, and the site works fine without that.

It is a design requirement that the site passes WCAAG2 accessibility, and works properly with screen readers and plain text browsers (such as elinks or lynx).

Project Gutenberg's focus is on creating and distributing the content (70,000+ books), so we have a site that's easy to maintain without requiring much special expertise. The autocat3 program, which generates landing pages and handles search, is already more complex than we would prefer due to organic growth over the years.

We do have some features we are hoping to add in the future. For example, a "shopping cart" approach where people would be able to select items, then return to see their flagged items or perhaps get a bulk download. Feature ideas are always welcome, regardless of whether you know how to implement them.

Specific skills of interest include Python programming and CSS, along with familiarity with HTML5 and other standards used for Project Gutenberg's content.

Respond to this newsletter to write back to me with your interests.


## Join Distributed Proofreaders
