.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.org/find

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.org/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

.:: Please note the following additional changes, corrections, improvements:

The title is changed from Fritofs to Fritiofs (and no,
there should be no apostrophe in that) and, for those
who keep note of such things, Andrew A Stomberg is now
listed as editor. Maybe that should be Editor / Contributor,
but I'm not fully up with the etiquette.

The language is correct in GUTINDEX, but listed as English
instead of Swedish in the database.

Further, it was individually posted as 7ftfs and 8ftfs;
I have deleted the ASCII 7ftfs10.* as valueless.

Jim Tinsley offers the following additional information regarding book
number 15559:

The value of the TeX/PDF in this posting is that it displays
the text with its original Fraktur font.

This is the third language for Robur; we already have it in
French and English, and this is our first translation of
Verne into German.

David Widger offers the following additional information regarding book number
15548:

This is the first Ilocano project to be submitted to PG. Ilocano is a
Philippine language spoken in the northern portion of the country.

Jim Tinsley offers the following additional information regarding a new
revision of Anna Kernina (#1399):

While the original text wasn't bad, this is a pretty major revision;
Eve sent me a heavily corrected version a few months ago, and I've
been picking at it since, restoring accents and italics, and fixing
more errors.
