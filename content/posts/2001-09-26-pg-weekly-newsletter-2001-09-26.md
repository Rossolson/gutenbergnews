Project Gutenberg's Weekly Newsletter for Wednesday, September 26, 2001

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*

*This month, with only four Wednesdays, we managed to make about the*
 same number of eTexts as we did last month, with five Wednesdays!!!

***

We need someone to write the weekly Newsletters for November. . . .
I'll be on the road. . . .
I can give you a kind of "fill in the blanks" approach to make it easy.
I should be able to do the monthly Newsletters. . . .

***

We got volunteer in North Dakota, and still need one in Wyoming.

***

We need some volunteers who can spend just a minute or two looking
over each of the three or so eTexts we post on the average day....
Just to download them and check to see that nothing went wrong in
final save and upload process.  Some times there will be missing
"hard returns" or there will be trailing spaces on some or all
of the lines, or there won't be the proper end of file marker,
margination, or header entries.  Nothing sophisticated here, we
just want to be able to catch obvious errors, and we can provide
a program we are porting to various operating system to make this
even easier as we go along.  100 Etexts per month is just too much
for any small group of people to do well. . . .

***

Please send in as much copyright research as you can in the next
month, as I plan to be away for November, and don't want to swamp
Greg Newby with more copyright research than is necessary.

Reuters writes that Clear Channel Communications, owner of 1,170 U.S.
radio stations, reportedly issued a list of 150 songs it doesn't want
deejays to play. Less concerned with offensive words and sites than the
public's militant-readiness state of mind, some of the "banned" tunes
include Simon and Garfunkel's "Bridge Over Troubled Water," John Lennon's
"Imagine," Neil Diamond's "America," and Peter and Gordon's "A World
Without Love."


***News Headlines From Edupage***


FACT-DRIVEN? COLLEGIAL? THIS SITE WANTS YOU
Wikipedia is a Web site where volunteers are striving to create a
free online encyclopedia that is built by consensual collaboration.
Participants are encouraged to supply new entries as well as edit
other people's entries. The encyclopedia is being built with Wiki
software, which allows text to be continuously updated by multiple
parties. Wikipedia may be even more valuable as a communal
environment for those who compile it than for those who merely use
it as a resource, according to the University of Pennsylvania's
vice provost for information systems, James J. O'Donnell. However,
the simplicity of the Wiki software makes it easy for less
objective participants or vandals to come in and disrupt the
project. Thus far, Wikipedia has avoided such unpleasantness, said
co-founder and Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales, who added that backup copies
exist so that any ruined data can be repaired.

KEY HOUSE LEADERS LOBBY TO DEFEAT DIGITAL MUSIC BILL
Six state representatives have begun lobbying their colleagues
to reject the Music Online Competition Act (MOCA), which seeks
to smooth the playing field for online music services. MOCA would
limit the power of the new online distribution services MusicNet
and Pressplay, which are supported by music industry linchpins
and hold the distribution rights to 40 percent of the digital
music market. Under the legislation, the two services would be
forced to issue uniform licenses to all competing online
broadcasters and music services. The bill is supported by Reps.
Boucher (D-Va.) and Chris Cannon (R-Utah), but the judiciary
subcommittee chairman overseeing the bill's progress is still
undecided on the issue. The six legislators opposing the bill
include the ranking Democrat and the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee.  (Newsbytes, 20 September 2001)

INFECTED DSL USERS LOSE ACCESS
Broadband service providers such as Speakeasy and DSL Inc. have
decreed that customers whose computers have not been patched to
block viruses such as Nimda and Code Red risk losing network
access if they become infected. Such ISPs say that customers have
been supportive of such action. "If people haven't applied the
patches, they are obviously clueless," said London systems
administrator Tony Monty. "Denying them access until they fix
their system is the only thing that will get their attention."
Even those who run computers invulnerable to viruses suffer
from slow connections due to the increased network traffic
that results from infected machines that continuously scan
the Internet for other potential hosts.
(Wired News, 21 September 2001)

DESPERATELY SEEKING SEARCH TECHNOLOGY
E-commerce companies that do not keep up on the latest search
technology or that have Web sites with paltry search options
risk losing business. Eighty percent of online users who encounter
poor search functions are likely to leave the site, according to
Jupiter Media Metrix. An obvious search button is a simple
solution that companies can take advantage of. Successful
e-commerce firms such as eBay have learned that improving search
tools results in more purchases from customers. Search engines
should also be designed to take common misspellings into account.
Perhaps the biggest hurdle e-commerce sites face is making their
private product databases available to public search engines.
This requires a change in thinking among technology staff, who
are very protective of what they consider proprietary data,
explained Google CEO Eric E. Schmidt.
