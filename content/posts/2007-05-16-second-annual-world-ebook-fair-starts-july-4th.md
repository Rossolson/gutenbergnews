### 100,000 Commercial eBooks from Sponsors of the World eBook Fair

In addition we are hoping to present over 100,000 commercial eBook titles from our friends at Digital Pulp Publishing, & eBooks About Everything and other fine commercial eBook sources...for a grand total of nearly 3/4 million eBooks.

The commercial eBooks are from Digital Pulp Publishing, presenting a wide and eclectic array bringing independent access to the broad open market through the efforts of many publishers; and also great numbers of additional books, perhaps totalling ~100,000 by July 4, from eBooks About Everything. Contact information is below.

* * *This collection of 3/4 million electronic books is of high quality and not to be confused with the un-proofread collection of eBooks a person finds at locations such as Google where not only are eBooks usually only available as snippets and graphics files, but are not always available from day to day.These are all full text editions that are yours to keep once their files have been downloaded to your computer, enough titles to fill 25 average public libraries.The Second World eBook fair includes the entire ~100,000 eBook set from Project Gutenberg's various collections as well as a ~400,000 set of collections from The World eBook Library, all of which will be available free of charge.</p>

~100,000 eBooks from The Internet Archive
+ 87,000 downloadable in progress eBooks
