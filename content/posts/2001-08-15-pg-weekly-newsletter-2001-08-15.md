has been $1250. . .no kidding. . .but they can't do this without some $$$.
If you can keep us running until the end of this year, they want me to be

more volunteer than Greg Newby who is willing to post Etext when I am gone.

We need people in the following countries to handle "life +50" books,
such as 1984 and Animal Farm, by George Orwell; Edgar Rice Burroughs,
H. G. Wells, and other authors who died in 1950 or earlier. . . .

We are hoping some people in these countries will make Etext sites.
WARNING!!!  Canada is hiding it, but they are contemplating moving
to "life +70". . .so if you want to get these and pass them on in
a legal manner. . .now is the time!!!  We have a site starting up
in Australia, so let me know if you would like to help it start!

Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Bulgaria,

Iceland, Japan, (South) Korea, Latvia, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Panama, the Philippines, Poland, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad
and Tobago, and Ukraine are all "life plus 50 years" countries,
or were last time I checked.) and Portugal.

People from these countries, and any others with copyrights of
"life +50" or less, should be able to legally download these.

Books posted on these sites may not yet be in the public domain in the
United States or other countries.  All users should check copyright
laws for the country in which the user is located since their own
law will generally govern what any user can legally download or do
with what they download.  I would NOT hot-link these URLs in the US
or "life +70" countries. . . .

If you would like to support this effort, either with Etexts,
sites to post one, or to help create a Project Gutenberg group
in Australia or other "life +50" countries please email:

***News Headlines From Newsscan and Edupage***

[Watch where your passwords go!]

ENCRYPTION AND ORGANIZED CRIME
When Phil Zimmerman created the encryption software known as PGP ("Pretty
Good Privacy") he knew that his program would be used not only by honest
citizens but also by criminals, and he says "I felt bad about that," but
notes that "the fact that criminals use cars doesn't mean that the rest of
us shouldn't have cars." Criminal use of PGP is now being examined in a
federal case against Nicodemo S. Scarfo Jr., accused of running gambling
and loan sharking operations for the Gambino crime family. The defendant's
lawyers are arguing that federal law enforcement officials acted
unconstitutionally when they evaded the privacy protections of PGP by
surreptitiously installing on Scarfo's personal computer some technology
that recorded every keystroke made, including his password. Their position
is that this action amounted to a wiretap, for which they should have
obtained a special court order, called a "Title III" order. But assistant
U.S. attorney Ronald Wigler says that "letters do not become 'electronic
communications' subject to Title III merely because they happen to have
been typed on a computer." (New York Times 30 Jul 2001)

PRIVACY ADVOCATES OBJECT TO "KEY LOGGING" TECHNOLOGY
Privacy advocates are strenuously criticizing the use by federal law
enforcement officials of "key-logging" technology to monitor the
communications of "Little Nicky" Scarfo, a reputed Philadelphia mob boss.
Rather than obtain a court-approved wiretap order, the officials used a
simple search warrant (much easier to obtain) in order to plant on Scarfo's
computer a yet-to-be-explained technology that monitors every keystroke,
including e-mail. Mark Rasch of the security consulting firm Predictive
Systems says: "The logical consequence of the government's argument is that
the government will never need to get a wiretap order for a computer. With
the technology that's available today, the government can remotely install
software on a computer to capture all keystrokes and transmit that report
to its agents in real time." (Washington Post 14 Aug 2001)

JUDGES TOLD THEY CAN'T REFUSE TO HAVE THEIR COMPUTERS MONITORED
In mid-September a policy-making group of 27 judges will decide whether to
accept the recommendations of a report urging denial of one court's request
to put an end to the monitoring of its computers for Internet misuse. One
observer says: "When the courts find themselves as not the arbitrators but
the victims of such a policy, all of a sudden you find judges saying 'this
could very well be a violation of our rights.' Now the judges are beginning
to understand how difficult this has been for the private sector so long."
The judge who objects to the monitoring says it should be used to prevent
vandal attacks by outside hackers, and not focused on internal computer
uses. (AP/San Jose Mercury News 14 Aug 2001)

INTERNET REGISTRAR TO CHALLENGE NAME CLAIMS
In response to widespread criticism, Afilias -- the company that runs the
new ".info" domain -- says it will challenge some of the more shaky claims
made on the most desirable names. The situation arose when Afilias allowed
businesses to claim their trademarks before registration was opened up to
the general public. Many of those claims were made on common dictionary
words, with registrants providing little or no trademark documentation.
Afilias rules allowed would-be challengers to register their complaints,
but charged them $295 to begin the process. Even if they were successful,
challengers were refunded only $220 of that fee. More than 25,000 .info
names have been claimed since preliminary registration opened July 25, and
Afilias exec Roland LaPlante says his company expects to file hundreds of
challenges with arbiters at the World Intellectual Property Organization.
Some of the names already claimed include books.info, consumers.info and
business.info. (AP 15 Aug 2001)

PRIVACY GROUPS STILL UNHAPPY WITH MICROSOFT
A coalition of consumer and privacy groups, including Junkbusters and the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, is making a new assault on
Microsoft, objecting to the Microsoft Passport service that will be
included in the forthcoming Windows XP: "We charge Microsoft with specific
unfair, deceptive and illegal behavior in collecting information [about
Passport users], and their [Microsoft's] response is to make merchants use
this pseudo-privacy technology. It's just insultingly nonresponsive."
Microsoft denies the group's claims, and says that Passport will give
people more convenience and control over what information they reveal about
themselves. (USA Today 15 Aug 2001)
http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/2001-08-15-xp-privacy-complaint.htm

MICROSOFT MAKES CONCESSION ON WINDOWS XP LINKS
Microsoft says it will modify its upcoming Windows XP software to make it
easier for users to work with digital photography software from Kodak and
others. The system originally had been designed to launch a "camera wizard"
(which was really Microsoft's competing program), and Kodak had complained
that it took considerable effort to install the software that it ships with
digital cameras. Microsoft had softened its stance on controlling the
interaction between Windows XP and digital photography after Kodak took its
case to antitrust officials and lawmakers in Washington. Still under
negotiation is Microsoft's plan to charge Kodak and others for placement in
a list of companies offering photo-finishing services online. (Los Angeles

WIRELESS INTERNET SPARKS SECURITY CONCERNS
Business travelers plugging into wireless Wi-Fi networks now found in
airports and coffee shops should beware -- those networks can easily be
intercepted, according to security experts. "When you sit in an airport and
use your laptop you might as well be broadcasting to anyone within listening
distance," says a digital forensics specialist with Predictive Systems. No
special software is required to intercept data off a Wi-Fi network, and
eavesdropping on other's e-mail exchanges is easy to do, says one security
expert. "Everyone who is touching the Internet should know that it is wide
open to everyone," says MobileStar chief technology officer Ali Tabassi.
"People should think of it as a pay phone or a cell phone, in a public
place." (AP 12 Aug 2001)

CRITICS SAY MICROSOFT SONG IS: 'IT'S MY PARTY AND I'LL CRY IF I WANT TO'
"Clarifying its policies," Microsoft announced yesterday that if PC
manufacturers plan to use the Windows XP desktop to display icons of
products that compete with its own, then the desktops will have to feature
at least three Microsoft products as well. In July, Microsoft had relaxed
its licensing requirements and allowed other manufacturers' products shown
on Windows desktops; now, critics are attacking it for changing course. An
AOL Time Warner executive says the company's decision "reveals the July 11
announcement of flexibility to be truly a farce. Microsoft's message to
consumers, computer makers and the government is, 'We own the desktop and
there's nothing you can do about it.'" (AP/San Jose Mercury News 10 Aug 2001)

NEW VIRUS SPREADS USING ACROBAT FILES
Portable Document Format (PDF) files used in Adobe Acrobat are
susceptible to an experimental virus, according to analysis by
HispaSec Sistemas head Bernardo Quinteros and Privacy Foundation
CTO Richard M. Smith. Quinteros and Smith say the virus,
Outlook.pdf, embeds itself in PDF files via Outlook. Users who
open the file with Acrobat are encouraged to click on an image
of a peach, thus releasing the virus. The e-mail addresses in
Outlook's Address Book and its folder are used to spread
Outlook.pdf. "Since PDF files are considered safe by Internet
Explorer, it means that Acrobat security holes are easy to
exploit from Web pages and HTML e-mail messages," warned Smith.

MORE ASTERISKS ADDED TO WINDOWS XP ICON POLICY
Microsoft has amended its decision to allow computer makers to
configure the Windows desktop. Although the company previously
said it would require only an MSN service icon if competing
services were added, Microsoft now asks for three specific
service icons, including Windows Media Player, MSN Explorer, and
Internet Explorer. Manufacturers can choose to remove icons for
Internet Explorer and MSN Explorer, but if they remove the MSN
Explorer icon, it must be replaced with an icon for MSN Internet
service. The Media Player icon cannot be removed. Critics see
the move as backtracking from the July 11 announcement that the
company would open up the desktop.
