3) News

Project Gutenberg has received a generous donation of over 20 Pentium
Pro 100 computers.  If you have a need for a computer to do Project
Gutenberg work or can make good use of computers (setting up a
"Project Gutenberg" section at a local library or school) please
let William Fishburne (william.fishburne@verizon.net) know!
The computers are physically in Northern Virginia and if you are not,
it would be necessary for you to arrange for the shipping cost.
Please send in your thoughts and ideas on how PG can make best use
of this dated windfall!  There are no boxes for most of these, so it
would be MUCH easier to organize a sort of "bucket-brigade" of people
who COULD get to the DC area [20 miles down towards Manassas] and get
some of these a day or two closer to others who may be able to make a
trip part way to get them, etc., etc., etc.  These are GREAT for any
wordprocessing, etc. . .it's just about exactly what I am using here,
for all my Project Gutenberg work.  However, these are NOT good for
the "bloatware" operating systems and programs if you are going to
reload and reboot a lot. . .takes some real time for this.  However,
I scanned the first books I ever OCRed on something much slower. . . .

Thanks!!!

News reaches us this week that 'Time Out New York' are featuring an article on
Project Gutenberg and Distributed Proofreaders. At publishing time there is
no sign of this on their website, but if you live in the TONY distribution
area you might want to ski down to your local store and take a look  (wrap up
warm now). If anyone can send me a copy of the article or finds it on the
web, I will run it in the newsletter next week.

4) Readers letters

I really enjoyed the newsletter.

{Thank you so much}

That said, I also need help.

Because of a misprint in my copy of The Bridal March
and One Day by Bjornstjerne Bjornson, I don't have
pp.162-175.   Unfortunately, no library in my area has
a copy of the book.  Could you put a note in the
newsletter to see if someone has access to the book
and can email me picture files of the pages?  The book
was published in 1912 by The Macmillan Company.

Thanks,
Nicole Apostola
napostola@yahoo.com


{There are no prizes for this, this weeks quiz question. Which country is
Bjornstjerne Bjornson from? Answer (I got it wrong) at the bottom of the
newsletter.}
                    -------------------

On the Distributed Proofreaders you asked for critiques of good works
that have gone through our site.

Although I have not actually read the following, I was impressed
enough that I downloaded them. (I am still looking for a cheap PDA to
read e-books on, I don't like reading from a desktop PC.)

- Darwiniana, by Thomas Henry Huxley. This is a collection of essays
(the second in the series) by the man they called Darwin's watch dog.
It is a very clear and intelligent defense of Darwin's ideas of
evolution, which is the more interesting because creationists are
often still rehashing the same arguments that Huxley defeated in
these essays over a hundred years ago.

- The Junior Classics, Volume 7. This is a series of short stories. I
don't know if they're all supposed to be true stories. I've read a
couple of these, and they are well written, though perhaps the
readers may already know them. The ones I read were about how Caesar
crossed the Rubicon, and how Jeanne d'Arc was defeated, but there is
also 'smaller' stuff in there.

- Bars and Shadows by Ralph Chaplin. Poems the author wrote in
prison. I don't normally go for poetry, but I could not say why I
like what I have seen from this.

- The School for Husbands by Moliere. I forgot why this was
important.

HTH,

with kind regards,

                    -------------------

I found a small text "Imperial Purple" (by Saltus?)six or seven months ago. An
extremely well written populist history that was very well received when it
came out, but has lapsed into obscurity. The notebooks of Leonardo DeVinci
were recently recommended by Barzun in From Dawn to Decadence, and they
are very hard to find.

5) Featured author

Ethel PEDLEY (1860-1898)

Dot and the Kangaroo

Dot and the Kangaroo is a children's book which will be enjoyed by readers
of all ages. When Dot is lost in the bush, she is befriended by a kangaroo
which has lost it's joey. She then meets many bush creatures including the
koala, platypus and many birds.

However, there is more to this story, which deliberately sets out to make a
plea for conservation of the bush and its animals--a remarkable objective
coming as it did at the end of the nineteenth century.

Pedley was a person of her time and the Australian aborigines are treated
unsympathetically. However, the whites also come in for criticism for their
attitude towards killing bush creatures.


Ethel Pedley's Preface to Dot and the Kangaroo

To the children of Australia
in the hope of enlisting their sympathies
for the many beautiful, amiable, and frolicsome creatures
of their fair land,
whose extinction, through ruthless destruction,
is being surely accomplished

The reference at the online books page is
http://digital.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=3703.
Apparently, it doesn't show up on the PG search engine at the moment.

--WHERE TO GET EBOOKS

http://promo.net/pg (aka http://www.gutenberg.net) allows searching by
title, author, language and subject.  Mirrors (copies) of the complete
collection are available around the world.

http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.


These sites and indices are not instant, as the cataloguing needs to be
done by our professional Chief Cataloguer. . .who is half way around the
world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.

--"INSTANT" ACCESS TO EBOOKS

Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download
site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:

http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04
or
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

and look for the first five letters of the filesname.  Note that updated
eBooks usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:

http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you can

help, by scanning just a few pages per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

More. . . .

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

We will also have this address in Chicago!

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful if
you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

7) Headline News from around the world

U.S. BACKS EMERGING ELECTRONIC NUMBERING SYSTEM
The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended support for an international
proposal to map telephone numbers to Internet addresses. The emerging
electronic numbering system, known as ENUM, would allow people to use one
number for many different purposes, including cell phones, e-mail, instant
messaging and faxes. "The United States should seize this opportunity and
take steps to participate in e164.arpa, consistent with the highest
standards of security, competition and privacy," says Assistant Secretary
Nancy Victory. The ENUM proposal grew out of the Internet Engineering Task
Force's Telephone Number Mapping working group and when implemented, would
allow users to have a telephone number that matches their e164.arpa
Internet address. Thirteen countries have signed onto the ENUM proposal
thus far and plan trials. The International Telecommunication Union is
coordinating the efforts. (CNet News.com 13 Feb 2003)

PACEMAKERS FOR THE BRAIN
Researchers from Arizona State University have shown that they could
predict more than 80% of brain seizures using software that's based on
chaos theory to analyze brain waves. University of Pennsylvania neurologist
Brian Litt explains that such prediction is possible because "seizures
develop over time. They don't just strike you like lightning." Dr. Leon
Iasemidis of Arizona State says he and his colleagues envision an implanted
device that "would automatically release a very low dose of anti-epilepsy
drug or an electrical signal that would block the seizure." (New York Times

RED HAT EARNS GOVERNMENT CERTIFICATION
The Advanced Server platform from Linux vendor Red Hat has been
certified compliant with the Defense Department's Common Operating
Environment (COE) standard. COE was created in 1993 to identify
security and interoperability requirements for software used by the
Defense Department, and Red Hat's certification marks the first such
approval for a Linux product. Officials from Red Hat said the company
worked for nearly a year to achieve the certification and that their
success will address some lingering concerns over "the
enterprise-readiness of open source software." Analysts agreed, saying
the COE certification will reassure many businesses that might
otherwise have been reluctant to use Linux products.
