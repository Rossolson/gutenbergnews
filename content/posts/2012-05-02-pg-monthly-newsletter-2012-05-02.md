This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for May 2012.

This is the Monthly Newsletter for Project Gutenberg.  Greetings from
sunny Alaska, where it will not be completely dark at night for another
4 months!

Springtime is a great time to think of new projects.  One that you
might consider is helping to bring literature to your friends, family,
colleagues, and strangers.  The www.gutenberg.org web site provides
access to nearly 40,000 eBooks, in dozens of different formats and 61
languages.  These books come in formats friendly for mobile devices
(kindle, nook, smartphone, etc.), and can be saved for reading any
time.

If you would like to help produce new eBooks, the easiest place to
start is at Distributed Proofreaders.  Visit www.pgdp.net to see how
to contribute your time to aid in creating new eBooks.

Here are our new postings from the past month.  Thanks to all the volunteers
who helped bring these titles to us!
