<img class="alignleft" title="World Annual Book Fair" src="/images/world-ebook-fair-logo.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="147" />The 5th Annual World eBook Fair hopes to hand out 1 million to 2 million eBooks every day from July 4 to August 4 for a total of 50 million eBooks in a single month.

Once again The World eBook Fair has added over a million new freely downloadable items in a single year to offer you many new items in many new formats, errors corrected, etc.

About a million of these bear smaller resemblance to today's average eBook, as they have been proofread and formatted for easier reading, search, and research, and many are available in various formats that include cellphones, PDA's, etc.

Celebrate the 40th Anniversary of eBooks with us July 4th to August 4th. . .Pick Up A Personal eLibrary from 3.7+ million eBooks, not to mention music, movies, artwork, etc.

All you have to do is visit the portal ([www.worldebookfair.org](http://www.worldebookfair.org "World eBook Fair")) and follow the pointers to the following collections, etc.

### The 40th year of eBooks will start on July 4 with 3.5+ million FREE eBooks available.

These books run the range from light to heavy literature and a host of other subjects and have been made available for you by hundreds of eLibraries around the world from extreme polish of The World Public Library's 750,000 titles to Project Gutenberg with over 100,000 well proofread eBooks to the 2+ million from The Internet Archive.

eBooks will be available in over 100 languages!!!

<!--more-->All of these should be in the public domain in the US, as well as in most other countries. Check your local copyright law to be sure they are public domain in your location.

If you ever wondered why you should buy a new terabyte drive–this is the reason. . .you can put a million plain text eBooks on a terabyte drive at a million characters per book. This is is pretty decent sized book of about 300 pages. If you run in .zip files or other similar compression formats you can have a terabyte drive with about 2.5 million similarly sized eBooks.

2.5 million eBooks in the palm of your hand!!! For $75!!!

You may also wish to try a relatively new eBook site:

http://www.freeliterature.org

Since april 15, 2010.

Two goals: supporting Project Gutenberg by producing eBooks, and so by producing and distributing free eLiterature on the web in general ... and more by linking to 600+ eBook sites, all over the world in many different languages – including general literature, poetry, Greek, Roman and Medieval, Art, Music, Audiobooks, Books and Literature in general, plus a body of Research, Education and Scientific Publications.

From the Projects page, check out a book you like to work on for a first or second round proofreading. Beginners are fully welcome and supported. Those wanting to do more will be hand guided through the whole process – all the way from scanning to a pleasantly readable e-book available to millions.

(Links will be more ordered thematically and by language in the near future...site still under construction, so we can't give firm details)

### DISCLAIMERS

The World eBook Fair presents both copyrighted and public domain in these various eLibraries. While you have permission to download an eLibrary of your own, and to pass it on free of charge, please make sure you honor copyrights where indicated, and check your own local copyright laws before presuming the others are in public domain out of the U.S. copyright jurisdiction. Copyright laws are changing so you might want to ask at your local libraries.

While most of the Project Gutenberg eBooks are in the public domain there many that are copyrighted for a variety of reasons. Before a sales attempt, we suggest you consult a copyright attorney after an earlier reading of the information accompanying each title.

While most of The World eBook Fair Materials are free of charge for any personal use via The World eBook Fair, note all copyrights.

### Grand Totals, Sub-Totals, etc.

Please note: In any combination of large collections of books will be any number of duplications, sometimes of the same edition or the same title and author, but a different edition. For example, these collections each have a number of editions of Shakespeare's works– but–in addition to this, both World Public Library and in Internet Archive collections, as well as many other such collections, nearly all of the Project Gutenberg collection appears. In addition, many of the items at http://www.gutenberg.cc are new electronic editions of the original Project Gutenberg editions at http://gutenberg.org.

Out of each million eBooks presented in The World eBook Fair, I may guess that about 10%, or 100,000, are more or less duplicates of an electronic edition available in one of the other collections.
