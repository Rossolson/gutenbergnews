Michael Hart gives us a couple of of intresting pieces of news in [this months PG Newsletter](https://www.gutenbergnews.org/20110121/pg-newsletter-archives-2011/ "PG Newsletters 2011").

In a recent article, [CNN wrote](http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/05/19/kindle.outsells.books/index.html?hpt=Sbin), "[a]s further proof of how digital media dominate today's entertainment, Amazon announced Thursday that its customers now buy more e-books for its Kindle device than all print books — hardcover and paperback — combined."

"Customers are now choosing Kindle books more often than print books. We had high hopes that this would happen eventually, but we never imagined it would happen this quickly — we've been selling print books for 15 years and Kindle books for less than four years," according to Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos.

Also, the Association of American publishers are saying that ebook sales for March 2011 were just about 2.5 times [in dollars] what they were in March, 2010, and there's more and more reports stating that eBooks are now outpacing paper in the various retail markets, and that's not even counting the number of free eBooks being handed out all over the world.

This really is the "Year of the eBook!!!"
