Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions.

archives, it will be at the end.



Headline News



More eBooks To More People Via More Hardware and Software


The 39th year of Project Gutenberg has started July 4th, 2009 and we are once
again be one of largest sponsors of The World eBook Fair at
http://www.worldebookfair.org, which will reach the neighborhood of ~2.5
million eBooks from July 4 to August 4, endin in about two weeks.

One of the major developments this year is the advance in the variety of
hardware and software methods of reading eBooks in more circumstances, more
locations, and, of course, with more eBooks in wider and wider circulation.

We will be sending out a special edition of this Newsletter a few weeks from
now reporting on these events.



Our 25,000th eBook In English Will Be Coming Up Shortly


If you have any ideas, suggestions, comments, etc., about how we might
commemorate this event, please let us know.


Our 30,000th eBook created under U.S. copyright law will come out a month or
two after that, please advise on suggestions.





We Recently Published Our:

200th eBook in Italian
400th eBook in Chinese
500th eBook in Finnish


We are coming up on our 250th in Spanish. . .suggestions???





iPhone Acquisition


As you know, we try to get one of each of the popular reading devices to test
how our eBooks work on them and demonstrate a wide variety of reading options.

A friend is updating his iPhone today and I am buying his old one, so we would
appreciate any suggestions of which programs we should load to demonstrate the
widest variety of readers.



Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!



FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The ideal piece around which to center this collection is one of the 8
megabyte USBs.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems and these were OEMed
by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular in a recognizable fashion because their
snapon connectors resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

We received two examples of RAM actually labeled "Flash,"
for the H-P 95 pocket DOS machine from 1991, and a sample of Fairchild bubble
memory, as well, from down under.

Thank you, Mate!



POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.





Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and totals from PG of
Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at

httpwww.gutenberg.cc

Where there are eBooks representing over 100 languages.

Here is the July emergency Newsletter in toto for archiving.


Extra Edition of the PG Newsletter

I'm sending this out now because I have serious doubts as to whether I will be
able to do this very easily when the Newsletter is actually due.  This may be
the last time on this hard drive that I actually get booted up, and it was
pretty much just luck that got me this far.

I'll be buying some new computers this week, I hope, with the hopes that I
will be more or less back to normal, but right now the thing won't even let me
make backups as the USB ports have power, but don't recognize any drives.

I'm actually dialed up on the modem right now.

If any of you have any suggestions as to the best deals I should be looking at
for laptops and netbooks, please let me know, and please cc:
gbnewby@pglaf.org



The Brief News


We are rapidly coming up to our 25,000th eBook in English and all suggestions
for what title to use are welcome.

This should take place next month.

In addition, we are coming up on our 30,000th PG eBook of all languages
perhaps a month or so after that, so we are also looking for a great eBook in
another language to put up as #30,000.

We are giving away about 75,000 books per day through the http://www.gutenberg
org server, for ~2 million per month and the monthly total was often over 3
million per month, all told over the past 4 years or so.

This means we have given away over 100 million books over the past 4 years,
just through that one site alone.



The World eBook Fair


In addition, over these same four years we have sponsored The World eBook Fair
along with The Internet Archive, The World Public Library,
ebooksabouteverything.org, etc.

http://www.worldebookfair.org handed out a million files, just on one day
alone, July 4, to start up this 39th year of presenting eBooks on the
Internet.

Please note:  this is less than a million eBooks, as some entries are multi-
file in nature.

Traffic has since dropped to about half that, with a very healthy 50,000
downloads per day of our "best sellers."

In its first year The World eBook Fair gave away nearly a total of 30 million
eBooks, and if the averages have been at 25 million over the 4 years, that's a
200 million book total over those two URLs over a 4 year period, or totals
somewhere in that range.

This does not count all the other sites such as Australia or Canada or PG of
Europe, etc.



The Current PG Totals

I'm not sure I have time right now to fill in everything, with monthly
comparisons as I usually do, as I am running mostly on adrenaline right now
and will have to stop soon to eat, sleep, shower, etc.

Here are the brief reports you can compare to last month:

I will also try to get back online after the fact and try to redo a real
Newsletter with all info as of July 21st.

Here are today's numbers for languages with 200+ eBooks:

Grand total for today: 29326

24725   English en
1442    French  fr
587     German  de
508     Finnish fi
433     Dutch   nl
402     Chinese zh
338     Portuguese      pt
242     Spanish es
202     Italian it

We have recently been averaging just under 10 books per day with some very
good days that are much better.

If we are lucky, we may do 3,500 to 4,000 books for 2009.

Not to mention the hundreds of books that have been updated and improved,
corrected, etc.


Many thanks to all who have helped us reach our 39th year!
