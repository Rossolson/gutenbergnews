<pre>The Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter--Nov. 21, 2009
eBooks Readable By Both Humans And Computers Since 1971


37 Months to The End of the World Via Mayan Calendaring
on December 21, 2012 [some now saying October 11, 2011]

Leaving 3 years 1 months, 12 1/3 seasons or 37 months.

Not to worry, I will still make long range predictions,
such as that there will be affordable petabytes [2021],
and enough eBooks to fill an entire petabyte around the
same time.



40 Years Ago The Following Just Got Started


The Lunar Landings

The Internet

Sesame Street

Wendy's Hamburgers





Only about 1/3 of Project Gutenberg readers are U.S.



We Recently Published Our:

200th eBook in Italian
250th eBook in Spanish
400th eBook in Chinese
500th eBook in Finnish
600th eBook in German
and our
400th eBook on PG of Canada
and
1800th eBook from Project Gutenberg of Australia


Our 1500th in French is expected right about now.

It is the four volume set of de Toqueville's "Democracy."





Our All Time Hottest Requests!!!!!!!


FLASH RAM


I am looking for the earliest flash RAM possible.

The ideal piece around which to center this collection is
one of the 8 megabyte USBs.

The very earliest were PCMCIA cards, such as used for the
Poqet computer, etc.

The earliest USB flash drives were DisgoDizgo, M-Systems
and these were OEMed by IBM, HP, etc. They are particular
in a recognizable fashion because their snapon connectors
resemble the connectors of jigsaw puzzles.

We received two examples of RAM actually labeled "Flash,"
for the H-P 95 pocket DOS machine from 1991, and a sample
of Fairchild bubble memory, as well, from down under.

Thank you, Mate!



POWERPOINT


We need someone who can do PowerPoint illustrations.

One in particular, building a 3-D box of 1,000 dominoes.





Additional Newsletter Services


In addition, we will provide the PG Canada Newsletter and
totals from PG of Australia, Europe, PrePrints, etc.

These totals do NOT include 75,000+ at

httpwww.gutenberg.cc

Where there are eBooks representing over 100 languages.

As you may have noticed, I cheated by a few days on the
date of this Newsletter so I could include #25,000 so I
should warn you that the monthly totals will be larger,
this month, and smaller next time.
