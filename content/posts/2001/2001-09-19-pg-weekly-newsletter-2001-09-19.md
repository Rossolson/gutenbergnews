Project Gutenberg's Weekly Newsletter for Wednesday, September 19, 2001

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*

***

This is being prepared a day early, as the site I normally work out of
seems to be having huge network problems, and I can't actually DO much
of the "virtual" work I would normally be doing today.  Luckily, a few
of our best volunteers are stepping in for me, and we may yet have the
extraordinary "normal" amount of Etexts you have come to expect from a
band of volunteers. . . .  I guess this turned out to be the best time
for me to train people to actually load up the Etexts for downloading,
directly, without me as the final editor and FTP agent. . .as I mayn't
be able to do it all that well tomorrow, certainly not easily today.

I had planned to do 6 books today, and barely managed to do one, and I
haven't been able to do all my email yet, either. . .things just lock,
for minutes at a time. . .so I work on local files while I continually
manage to think globally.

So far, as of about midnight, David Widger managed to add 8 more books
so we WILL have a reasonable total by the time the Newsletter goes out.

***

We still need volunteer in North Dakoka, and now one in Wyoming.

***

We need some volunteers who can spend just a minute or two looking
over each of the three or so eTexts we post on the average day....
Just to download them and check to see that nothing went wrong in
final save and upload process.  Some times there will be missing
"hard returns" or there will be trailing spaces on some or all
of the lines, or there won't be the proper end of file marker,
margination, or header entries.  Nothing sophisticated here, we
just want to be able to catch obvious errors, and we can provide
a program we are porting to various operating system to make this
even easier as we go along.  100 Etexts per month is just too much
for any small group of people to do well. . . .

***

Please send in as much copyright research as you can in the next
month, as I plan to be away for November, and don't want to swamp
Greg Newby with more copyright research than is necessary.

MASSIVE E-MAIL GROWTH PREDICTED
E-mail use is set to grow 138% over the next four years, according to
researchers at IDC, who are forecasting 1.2 billion e-mail mailboxes by
2005. By that time, the number of personal e-mail messages sent in an
average day will exceed 36 billion. Growth will be fueled by increased use
of free Web-based services, such as Hotmail, and the proliferation of
Web-enabled devices, such as cell phones and PDAs. "Wireless access through
e-mail devices will offer new ways for e-mail users to remain connected
longer while on the move," says IDC researcher Mark Levitt. (Ananova 18 Sep

MICROSOFT POSTPONES FLIGHT SIMULATOR UPDATE
Saying that "it's just an inappropriate time to release the product,"
Microsoft is delaying the launch of the new version of its Flight Simulator
software, which game players use to pilot simulated flights of a variety of
aircraft (from gliders to jet liners) over much of the world, including New
York City and the World Trade Center towers. If a player's aircraft strikes
a building the program shows that the plane has crashed, but the buildings
do not blow up. Microsoft is removing depictions of the World Trade Center
from new releases of the game, and offering a software patch on its Web
site allowing owners of existing copies of the game to remove the towers.

NEW WORLD ORDER, COPYRIGHT STYLE  [!!!!!!!]
An international treaty currently being drafted would force
foreign companies to abide by domestic court judgments and vice
versa. Representatives of more than 50 countries are currently
drafting the framework in the Hague, including China, the European
Union, and the United States. The U.S. Patent Office will host a
discussion of the topic this week, which is expected to draw
spokespeople from the many different industries the law would
affect. Morrison & Foerster lawyer Barbara Welbery, who will speak
on behalf of Yahoo! at the hearings, said ISPs fear the law would
subject them to multitudes of lawsuits, making them responsible
for content delivered over their networks. However, groups from
the movie and music industries look forward to the law that would
help them enforce copyright infringement protection overseas and
allow them to attack file-trading sites based in other countries.

DUELING ESSAY CONTESTS IN FRAY INVOLVING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is hosting
a contest that offers a prize of $600 for the best essay that
answers the question, "What does intellectual property mean to
you in your daily life?" Last week, an organization of academics,
artists, and proponents called Wipout announced a contest that
asks participants to answer the same question, but with a more
critical eye. Wipout's members oppose the extensive intellectual
property protection that WIPO favors, calling such measures
detrimental to the public. Patent laws, for instance, could
hinder access to AIDS drugs in South Africa, according to the
Treatment Action Campaign, one of Wipout's supporters. It
has yet to be seen if WIPO will sue Wipout's self-described
"intellectual property counter-essay contest" for copyright
infringement.  (New York Times, 10 September 2001)
