Project Gutenberg's Weekly Newsletter for Wednesday, October 10, 2001

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*

***

Please send in as much copyright research as you can in the two weeks!
. . .as I plan to be away for November, and don't want to swamp Greg Newby
with more copyright research than is necessary.

If you have sent in over a week ago that have not gone through, please resend.
We didn't get much of any mail for the 10 days after 9/11, and I don't think
it's ever going to come.

***

Any volunteers around Salt Lake City?
We need someone who can help out there.
Please reply to:
Anne Wingate &lt;gutenberg77@aol.com&gt;



***

We need some volunteers who can spend just a minute or two looking over each
of the three or so eTexts we post on the average day....
Just to download them and check to see that nothing went wrong in final save
and upload process.  Some times there will be missing "hard returns" or there
will be trailing spaces on some or all of the lines, or there won't be the
proper end of file marker, margination, or header entries.  Nothing
sophisticated here, we just want to be able to catch obvious errors, and we
can provide a program we are porting to various operating system to make this
even easier as we go along.  100 Etexts per month is just too much for any
small group of people to do well. . . .

We created 22 new eTexts for you this week.

With 3967 eTexts online as of October 10, it now takes an average of
100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.52 from each book, for
Project Gutenberg to have alreacy given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One Trillion
Dollars] in books.

*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

We currently have 58 *reserved* slots, which is why the total number of titles
is not as high as the Etext ####'s might indicate. . .and we are also working
on two sections now, the 4000's and the 4100's

Our Total For The Year Is About 931 For 282 days, this is 3.30 per day or 99
Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1205 For The Year. . . .
We are about 41 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.

"What we become depends on what we read after all of the professors have
finished with us. The greatest university of all is a collection of books."
(Thomas Carlyle)

YAHOO WON'T CHANGE CHATROOM POLICY
Trading in shares of Viasource Communications and Extreme Networks was halted
Monday after a bogus document resembling a PR Newswire release was posted in a
Yahoo Finance chatroom. Yahoo took the release off the message board as soon
as it was contacted by PR Newswire. A spokeswoman said, "All of our message
boards are considered unmoderated pieces of public forum. We don't proactively
monitor the content of our boards." Citing Yahoo's user-privacy policy, she
did not comment on whether Yahoo intended to pursue an investigation to
determine who posted the press release. (Wall Street Journal 10 Oct 2001)

[Reality and TV Coincide. . .just 12 hours before this was sent to me, the
"Judging Amy" courtroom drama dealt with the same issue.  The perp was a 14
year old who had expanded a school project into real trading, and was
experimenting with responses to such postings.  Judge Amy gave her the tough
love treatment usually reserved for people such as "Zero Cool" and Kevin
Mitnick "Phyber Optik" and forbade her access until she [the perp was female]
turned 18.]

AMAZON DEBUTS 'LOOK INSIDE THE BOOK' FEATURE Amazon.com is moving to enable
online shoppers to thumb through a few pages of the books it sells through a
"Look Inside the Book" feature that includes images of covers, flaps and
actual pages. "It's something that customers have been telling us they'd like
to do," says Steve Kessel, VP of Amazon's media division. "It's sort of the
logical next step for them in terms of making a purchase decision... For art
and photography books, people can check the quality of the images. They can
look at children's books to see what the graphics look like and how big the
font is and whether it's suitable for their child; they want back covers of
mystery books so they can see quotes from other mystery writers." The new
feature is available for some 25,000 book titles. (Reuters 10 Oct 2001)

JOURNALISTS WIN ANOTHER CONTEST OVER DIGITAL RIGHTS The U.S. Supreme Court has
refused to hear an appeal by National Geographic after an appellate court
sided with a photo journalist who sued the publication for including his work
in CD-ROM form without his permission and without offering him additional
payment. The freelancer's photographs had appeared in the National Geographic
over three decades. (San Jose Mercury News 10 Oct 2001)

MICROSOFT OFFERS NEW POCKET PC VERSION
On Thursday Microsoft launched the latest version of its Pocket PC, a move
that may strengthen its competitive stance against Palm. Palm leads the
handheld market with an 80 percent share, compared to Microsoft's 16 percent.
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer touted the device as a "connectivity machine,"
boasting links to products such as Microsoft's Exchange server and the
Microsoft SQL server database. The company hopes that such advantages and
their popularity among corporate users will enable Microsoft to garner a
bigger market share. Compaq Computer, Symbol Technologies, and Toshiba are
among the manufacturers building the Pocket PCs.

About the Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter:

About the Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately at noon each Wednesday, but various different relays
will get it to you at different times; you can subscribe directly, just send
me email to find out how, or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by
yourself.]

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about how to
subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings, and retrieve
back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in receiving
regulary newsletters and other announcements about the Project Gutenberg
etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers "gutvol-d" =
Discussion among active volunteers "hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for
active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe, the
others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list into two
new lists:

   gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
   gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to one of
these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter on a monthly
basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which help people to hear
sooner about the latest books that were published by Project Gutenberg.  Each
list receives periodic announcements about Project Gutenberg, as well.
Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an email
message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the message
should contain text such as:

	subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is replaced
by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message might
contain:

	subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it from the
header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't address
your message to an address such as "listserv" or "listprocessor" or
"majordom".  However, for backward compatibility, "listproc@lyris.unc.edu"
still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different mailing
lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and
that it is possible you do not receive our newsletters directly from us.  In
any case of that nature, you would have to deal with that mailing list
directly.  If you look through the email header information, you should be
able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

	unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every message
you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list contents,
and change some personal settings.  Visit http://lyris.unc.edu and select one
of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything else
related to the mailing lists, please email "owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu"
to contact the lists' (human) administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris features, you can
find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you would
like more information about Project Gutenberg, including an easy search tool
to find and read our etexts, visit the Official Web Pages at
