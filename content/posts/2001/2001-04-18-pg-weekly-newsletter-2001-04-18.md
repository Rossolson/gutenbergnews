This is still a test of doing the Newsletters on a weekly basis. . . .

This will only be a test for the next few weeks, expect a full Newsletter
the first Wednesday of May, and perhaps even June and July. . .but if we
continue to grow, we will have to eventually go to a shorter format. . .

So far all responses have been to go to a weekly format, so I will work
on getting into that format, with one extra for monthly progress report.

TRANSITION TO DIGITAL TV IS SLOW, SLOW, SLOW
Only 1.1 million digital TV sets (about 1% of all TV sets in U.S.
households) have been sold as of January 2001, far fewer than Congress
anticipated four years ago when it gave the nation's 1600 TV channels new
blocks of airwaves for digital programming. So far, only 186 of those
stations are broadcasting in digital format, covering 64 U.S. cities. To
speed up the process, President Bush's budget proposal includes a plan that
would levy a US$200 million yearly fee on broadcasters that continue to
broadcast in analog after 2006, thereby blocking the reassignment of radio
spectrum for uses, such as next-generation wireless phone services. (San
Jose Mercury News 13 Apr 2001)

INTEL CHIP CUTS MAY LEAD TO PRICE WAR WITH AMD
Intel thinks that economic factors have begun to stabilize, and is
reporting that the company has slightly beat its lowered earnings
forecasts. Intel is about to introduce its next-generation 1.7
gigahertz Pentium 4 chip, possibly for as low as $350, and research
analyst Eric M. Thomas says that "if it debuts at $350, that's a big,
big drop," likely to lead to a price war between Intel and Advanced
Micro Devices. (New York Times 18 Apr 2001)

LAPTOP PRICES FALLING
A number of computer laptop models are being priced close to the
$1,000 level, which is thought to be the magical number required to
cause significantly increased consumer purchases of low-end devices.
The lowest price so far is offered by Dell, with its Inspiron 2500
starting at $1,049. IDC industry analyst Alan Promisel is predicting
that Dell is "really going to hit a sweet spot in the consumer
market." (USA Today 17 Apr 2001)

Project Gutenberg has three mailing lists.  Here is information
about how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration
settings, and retrieve back issues.

In January 2000, UNC (who hosts our mailing lists) changed from
Listprocessor to Lyris software for managing mailing lists.  Lyris has
similar capabilities, but also offers a convenient Web interface.
However, we recommend using email for subscribing and unsubscribing.

The lists:

"gutnberg" = General Public Announcements, including the monthly newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers

To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@lyris.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-l Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-d Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message might contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@lyris.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom" (for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works).

To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with the mailing in question, presuming you still wanted
to unsubscribe in that case.  If you look through the email header
information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.
Send email to "lyris@lyris.unc.edu" with the text:

	unsubscribe gutnberg
or	unsubscribe gutvol-l
or	unsubscribe gutvol-d

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@lyris.unc.edu"
to contact the lists' (human) administrator.


Thanks!
