This is still a test of doing the Newsletters on a weekly basis. . . .

This will only be a test for the next few weeks, expect a full Newsletter

continue to grow, we will have to eventually go to a shorter format. . .

So far all responses have been to go to a weekly format, so I will work
on getting into that format, with one extra for monthly progress report.

A federal appeals court has ruled that accessing restricted Web
sites or e-mail is a violation of the Wiretap Act. Under that
interpretation, law enforcement officials would have to apply
for a wiretap order instead of a search warrant. Police and
prosecutors say getting a wiretap order is out of the question
in many cases because of the restrictions placed on obtaining
one. However, privacy advocates say that the ruling is overdue,
because e-mails and information on restricted Web sites are no
different from other stored information such as messages in
voice mailboxes, which are already protected under wiretap law.

KNOWLEDGE KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES
Brazil, Columbia, and Venezuela are collaborating on an
Internet-based education program to provide math and science
software to their secondary schools. The programs will be
developed in modules of curriculum by teams from each country,
posted on the Web, and critiqued by the other teams. The
International Virtual Education Network program is funded in part
by the Inter-American Development Bank and will be designed to
take advantage of the benefits of technology and the Internet.
Brazilian physics professor Cesar Nunes, an advisor for the
program, says the simulation focus of the curriculum will help
motivate students to learn. Because the Internet infrastructure
of these countries is somewhat underdeveloped, versions of
browser software and proxy servers will be installed in schools
without good Internet connections so that classrooms can run the
programs from CD-ROMs. Altogether, the trans-national curriculum
will cost the countries $5 million and has already caught the
interest of Argentina, Peru, and African nations.
