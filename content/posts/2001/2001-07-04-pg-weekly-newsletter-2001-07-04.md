Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet

"When I was a young man I observed that nine out of ten things I did were
failures. I didn't want to be a failure, so I did ten times more work."
George Bernard Shaw


30 years ago today, Project Gutenberg posted the first electronic text
for download on what would eventually become the Internet. . .it was a
simple 5,000 byte file. . .all in CAPS. . .since computers didn't have
lower case yet back then. . .it was the US Declaration of Independence
and one similar Etext was added each year for the rest of the 1970's--

The 1980's saw a great expansion in the size of the Etexts being done,
with two majors works, each 1,000 times larger than the first one. . .
The Bible and The Complete Works Of William Shakespeare.

By July of 1991, there were 17 such Etexts including Project Gutenberg
receiving three major Etexts from outside sources:  Moby Dick, Roget's
Thesaurus, and The 1990 CIA Factbook.  Along with such classics as The
Adventures of Peter Pan and Alice [Wonderland and The Looking Glass] a
new generation of readers had been born.

For each one of those 17 Etexts that were available in 1971, there are
now over 1,000 Etexts listed in the Internet Public Library alone!!!

Just a few years ago, when there were only 10,000, people said this is
the kind of growth pattern that could not continue, but as you read on
below, you will see that it will not only continue, but that we should
still be able to expect 1,000,000 files by 2010 if support continues.

It's hard to realize that Project Gutenberg has been around as long as
Sesame Street and Big Bird, as long as ABC's Wide World Of Sports or a
variety of other continuing events we think of historically, even such
events as the Super Bowl only came into their own about 30 years ago--
believe it or not, the first Super Bowl, even though it was broadcast,
taped, and filmed by BOTH CBS and NBC, all the complete TV recordings,
no kidding, were tossed out, along with most of the other recordings a
world of television and movies has lost throughout the years. . .

Yet not one word of Project Gutenberg has been lost throughout all the
time since July 4th, 1971. . . .

During that time Project Gutenberg has release approximately 3600 text
and other files, for an average of 120 per year, about 1 every 3 days.

Of course, as with all logathrimic growth, half of our work was done a
much shorter while ago with our 100th Etext not coming until then very
end of 1993, officially released in January, 1994. . .even then we all
tried to be a little ahead of schedule for better proofreading. . . .

The 1,000th Etext would come in 1997, and would be Dante in Italian, a
major effort to include the classics of other languages. . .though our
releases that same day included two English translations.

Our 2,000th Etext would continue this trend, with the Spanish classic,
Don Quijote.

We started a new trend of original translations with Siddhartha, since
the original translations were still under copyright monopoly, but the
original German had just expired under US copyright law.  Again we did
both the English and German versions, a trend we hope to continue with
more efforts similar to those of our Etexts #2499 and 2500.

For #3000 we started our collection of Proust, in the original French.

And for our recent #3500, we did Ceiriog, in Welsh.

So far we have released Etexts in 16 different languages, and have our
first Greek Etext in progress, as well as one that will include a text
in translation in at least 77 languages.

It looks as though we will complete 1,000 Etexts this year, and soon a
monthly count of 100.

Welcome to the future. . .

in which we hope to post Etexts in all languages, with sites in nearly
all countries, and through which we hope to give away a quadrillion of
these Etext titles to a billion readers around the world.

***

I give my heartfelt thanks to the thousands of volunteers who bring us
these Etexts. . .

Never in the field of education have so many received so much from so few.

MICROSOFT PULLS CONTROVERSIAL SMART TAG FEATURE
Bowing to a wave of criticism, Microsoft says it will kill plans to include
a Smart Tag feature in its forthcoming Windows XP operating system. The
feature would have allowed Internet Explorer to turn any word on any Web
site into a link to Microsoft's own sites and services, or to a site of
Microsoft's choosing. The company continues to defend Smart Tags in
principle, and plans to work toward including it in a future version of
Windows or Internet Explorer, but group VP Jim Allchin said the decision
was made to remove the Smart Tags because "we got way more feedback than we
ever expected." Although many people view the public reaction against Smart
Tags as excessive, Wall Street Journal columnist Walter Mossberg says,
"...Microsoft's dominant Internet Explorer browser is like a television
set, or a digital printing press, for the Web. Its function is to render --
accurately and neutrally -- all Web pages that follow standard
programming... Microsoft has a perfect right to produce and sell its own
Web content with its own points of view. But it is just plain wrong for the
company to use the browser to seize editorial control and to steal readers
from other sites." (Wall Street Journal 28 Jun 2001)

About the Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter:

About the Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately at noon each Wednesday, but various
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]

I've closed down gutnberg (it responds with a message giving
instructions on gweekly and gmonthly if anyone tries to subscribe),
and populated gweekly and gmonthly with all the subscribers.

I will send out info to both lists on how to unsubscribe etc.

Here are the new instructions you asked for:

-------- mailinglist-howto.txt

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

  gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
  gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

	subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

	subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

	unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
would like more information about Project Gutenberg, including an easy
search tool to find and read our etexts, visit the Official Web Pages
at http://promo.net/pg
