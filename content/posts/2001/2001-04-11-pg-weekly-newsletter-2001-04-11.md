AOL INSTANT MESSENGER MAY HAVE SHOT ITSELF IN THE FOOT
AOL's decision to close off its instant messaging system may come back to
haunt it, as other service providers, including Microsoft, Excite@Home and
Yahoo, join forces to pursue an interoperable messaging network. IMUnified,
as it's called, provides members with the ability to send instant messages
to subscribers of other systems, and AOL could eventually find itself
isolated, say some industry analysts. "I think Microsoft is ultimately
going to win the instant messaging wars," says one telecom specialist.
"Microsoft thinks strategic, while AOL thinks tactical." (CNet News.com 5

TRACKING THE BOSTON MARATHON [This is already done with NASCAR]
Boston Marathon fans will be able to track a favorite runner's progress
through automatic e-mail updates sent during the race on April 16. Runners
can register up to two e-mail addresses to receive the updates, which will
be sent as they cross checkpoints at the 10K, half-marathon, and 30K marks
and the finish line. Race results will be available over the Internet and
the Boston Athletic Association Web site, where updates from 11 checkpoints
will be posted, searchable by name or bib number. In addition,
representatives from Compaq will be stationed along the 26.2-mile course,
armed with iPAQ handhelds to assist friends and fans in finding their
runners. The Marathon has used shoelace-mounted transponder chips to track
runners since 1995, but official times for the winners are still determined
by stopwatches. (AP 4 Apr 2001)

MIT'S CATHEDRAL OF LEARNING: ONLINE AND FREE
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has committed up to $100 million
for a 10-year project to create public Web sites that offer, without
charge, learning materials used in almost all of its 2,000 courses. The
materials will include lecture notes, problem sets, syllabuses, exams,
simulations, and video lectures. Called OpenCourseWare, the program is not
intended for "audit" purposes and not as a means for students to earn
college credits. Computer science professor Hal Abelson explained: "In the
Middle Ages people built cathedrals, where the whole town would get
together and make a thing that's greater than any individual person could
do and the society would kind of revel in that. We don't do that as much
anymore, but in a sense this is kind of like building a cathedral." MIT
President Charles M. Vest is confident that the new program will in no way
detract from the value received by residential students who are paying
tuition of $26,000 for the on-campus experience of working directly with
faculty and other students." I don't think we are giving away the direct
value, by any means, that we give to students. But I think we will help
other institutions around the world... I also suspect in this country and
throughout the world, a lot of really bright, precocious high school
students will find this a great playground." (New York Times 4 Apr 2001)
