Subject: [gmonthly] gmonthly welcome, and mailing list instructions
From: Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@ils.unc.edu&gt;
To: "Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter" &lt;gmonthly@listserv.unc.edu&gt;
Date: Thu, 31 May 2001 14:41:41 -0400

Gutnberg subscribers: You should have received my earlier message to
"gweekly" about the mailing list changes.

Below is a much more detailed information file about mailing lists.
At the bottom of this message, you will find personalized unsubscribe
instructions to help unsubscribe from gmonthly.

Remember that you are now on both gweekly and gmonthly.  You are
welcome to stay subscribed to both, but most people will probably want
to unsubscribe from one.  Since every message to the list includes
unsubscribe instructions, it's safe to wait for a little while to
decide which you want to keep.


Here is the mailinglist how-to document:

--------
Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

  gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
  gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

	subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

	subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

	unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
would like more information about Project Gutenberg, including an easy
search tool to find and read our etexts, visit the Official Web Pages
