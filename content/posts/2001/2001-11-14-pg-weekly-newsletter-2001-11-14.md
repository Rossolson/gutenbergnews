NEWSSCAN NEWS SCANS (FROM NOV.9 AND NOV.13 NEWSSCAN DAILIES):

E-BOOK PROGRAM GOES UP IN SMOKE
When book publishing company Random House established its AtRandom e-book
division a year ago a Random House executive said: "This is the brave new
world we want to see. No printing, no paper and binding, no need for a
sales conference or printed catalog -- we don't know the size of the
market, but it could be potentially very profitable for us." A year later,
the company has determined the size of the market -- and is closing down
the AtRandom imprint. A spokesman for the company awarded the project a
grade of A-for-effort, saying: "I think we did a great job putting together
a program that would have made good e-books available had been people been
buying e-books in any real numbers." (New York Times 9 Nov 2001)
http://partners.nytimes.com/2001/11/09/technology/09BOOK.html

NUMBER OF INTERNET USERS UP 15% IN OCTOBER
The number of Internet users grew 15% last month over October 2000 totals,
with a record 115.2 million people going online, according to new figures
from Nielsen/NetRatings. Although the year-over-year growth rate is
significantly below the 35% posted in October 2000, the increase is still
significant, given the current economic climate and the stagnant market for
PCs. The average Internet user spent 19 hours and 2 minutes online in
October, compared with 17 hours and 5 months the month before and 17 hours
and 30 minutes a year earlier. (Wall Street Journal 13 Nov 2001)

GATES REFLECTS ON FUTURE HOPES AND PAST SINS
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates says his two top priorities now are improving
the reliability of his company's software and conquering the market for
"tablet" computers, the laptop-size computers that can be used like a
clipboard. The tablets can be written on with a special stylus, and the
writing is then treated by Microsoft software as though the words had been
typed. Gates says tablet PCs will overtake laptops by 2005. As for software
reliability, Gates is repentant: "We're doing a little bit of mea culpa on
this. These are areas where Microsoft needs to improve. It affects the way
we develop code." (USA Today 12 Nov 2001)

FLASH CARD

"An education isn't how much you have committed to memory, or even
how much you know. It's being able to differentiate between what you know
and what you don't." (Anatole France)

IBM'S NEW SUPERCOMPUTER UPS THE ANTE
IBM is developing a next-generation commercial supercomputer that it says
will run 15 times faster than today's most powerful machines, while
consuming only one-fiftieth of the energy. The new machine is based on
IBM's $100-million Blue Gene model, currently under construction, which is
designed to handle large-scale biomolecular calculations. The
next-generation Blue Gene/L will be built in partnership with the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, and though it will be slightly slower than
the original Blue Gene design, it will still be able to out-compute the 500
top supercomputers in the world combined, according to the company. Its
speed stems from a design that uses 65,000 data-chip cells optimized for
data access. Each chip includes two processors, one for computing and one
for communicating, plus its own on-board memory. The Blue Gene/L, which IBM
sees as the prototype of a new generation that is more geared toward
commercial rather than scientific applications, will be used to simulate
physical phenomena, such as fires and explosions. (Financial Times 9 Nov

EUROPEAN COUNCIL ADOPTS FIRST CYBERCRIME TREATY
The 43-nation Council of Europe has adopted a convention on cybercrime that
criminalizes activities such as fraud and child pornography committed over
the Web and sets up global law enforcement procedures for conducting
computer searches, intercepting e-mail messages, and extraditing criminal
suspects. The convention marks the first treaty on criminal offenses
committed via the Internet. It will enter into force once five states,
including at least three Council of Europe member nations, have ratified
it. States will have that opportunity at a conference on cybercrime to be
held in Budapest on November 23. (Reuters 8 Nov 2001)

CYBERSECURITY CHIEF NOT INTERESTED IN NATIONAL ID CARD
Bush Administration cybersecurity chief Richard Clarke is showing little
interest in a proposal from Oracle's Larry Ellison to create a national
identity card as part of the nation's response to the dangers posed by
terrorists. Clarke says that no one he's talked to in the administration
thinks it's a good idea, and civil liberties groups have uniformly opposed
the plan. (ZDNET/USA Today 9 Nov 2001)

HONORARY SUBSCRIBER: LOUIS PASTEUR
      Today's Honorary Subscriber is the 19th century French chemist Louis
Pasteur (1822-1895), who founded the modern science of microbiology and
made medical history with his "germ theory" of infectious diseases. His
name is honored today by our use of the term "pasteurization" for the
heating process he developed to destroy harmful microbes in perishable food
products without damage to the food.
      What may not be as well known are his discovery of the bacillus
responsible for anthrax and his preparation of an effective immunizing
agent. Another of his groundbreaking contributions to microbiology and
medicine was the discovery that weakened forms of a microbe could be used
as an immunization against more virulent forms of the microbe. In his
search for a vaccine against rabies, he came upon the world of viruses,
microorganisms so small that they could not be seen under a microscope.
      Pasteur was born the son of a relatively poor tanner at Dole, in the
Jura mountain region of France. He was an indifferent student, interested
mainly in the fine arts, until he was inspired by the lectures of his
chemistry instructors to pursue a career in that field. As a young
chemistry instructor, Pasteur achieved early fame for experimental work in
crystal formation that he acknowledged was due less to his arduous efforts
than to a sheer chance factor in the choice of the material used. This gave
rise to his famous aphorism: "Chance favors the prepared mind."
      He followed his early success with investigations of problems wine
makers were having with fermentation, and later the silkworm disease
plaguing the silk industry. Out of these investigations came his
revolutionary findings of the bacterial nature of infectious diseases, and
their control through vaccination, hygiene and sterilization. These and his
many other accomplishments were achieved despite a partially paralyzing
stroke at the age of 46.
      In 1888, Pasteur became the first director of the Pasteur Institute,
a medical treatment and experimental facility established and named in his
honor. It is now one of the most famous centers of biological research in
the world. When Pasteur died in 1895, he was rightly considered the
greatest "physician" of all time, notwithstanding his lack of a medical
degree.
