PROJECT GUTENBERG WEEKLY NEWSLETTER FOR NOVEMBER 28, 2001

HI. . .Michael Hart here. . .only back an hour now, so my
completeness on this should be considered a little suspect,
as I have barely been able to edit up this Newsletter to
include our latest postings and delete duplicated portions.

So, please forgive any errors, but still let me know. . .
but gently, I'm still on Hawaii time. . . .

Bonus:  Greg Newby will also send a Newsletter in a few hours.

Two For The Price Of One. . . .

Of course this will frustrate cataloguers for years to come. . .hee hee!


***4,152 Tree-Friendly Titles Online***

In this issue of the Project Gutenberg Weekly newsletter:
   - The need for donations
   - Copyright research contact info
   - Online proofreading team
   - Anyone in Salt Lake City?
   - Making Donations, States list
   - Access to the collection
   - Non-English Texts
   - Information about Mirrors
   - Project Gutenberg of Australia new web address
   - 7 new etexts at Project Gutenberg of Australia
   - "Life + 50" Copyright Countries Listing
   - 63 updated etexts, including 9 etexts in new formats
   - 24 new U.S. etexts
   - Statistics
   - Newsscan news
   - Information about mailing lists



Copyright and "Life + 50":

The last list we received indicated these were all the "life +50's":

Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Bulgaria,
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, El Salvador,
Iceland, Japan, (South) Korea, Latvia, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Panama, the Philippines, Poland, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad
and Tobago, and Ukraine are all "life plus 50 years" countries.

Please advise of changes.

Works which are in the public domain in Australia and other "Life + 50"
countries may remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not
download, or read online, such books if they are in a country where
copyright protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death. The
author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral rights to
oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot of readers out
there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary works of the
twentieth century.

Col Choat has moved his Project Gutenberg of Australia website
from:  http://au.geocities.com/gutenberg_au/
to:    http://gutenberg.net.au/

Here's more information from Project Gutenberg of Australia:

Here in Oz we are celebrating the launch of our permanent PG site,
gutenberg.net.au, after being temporarily located at au.geocities.com
for a time.

We have 26 books listed which are in the public domain in Australia so
why not drop in and have a look!  We also have listed all of the PG
etexts (from both the US and Oz sites) which were written by
Australians or which relate (loosely) to Australia.

Books enter the public domain in Australia 50 years after the author's
death, provided they were published during the author's lifetime. For
translations, the same rules apply to the person translating.
Therefore, we only need to be satisfied that the author died at least
50 years ago and that the work was published during his/her
lifetime. Copyright cannot be renewed or revived by subsequent
publication, nor does a copyright held by a person other than the
author have any validity in such cases.

Of course, works which are in the public domain in Australia may
remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not download, or
read online, such books if they are in a country where copyright
protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death. The
author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral
rights to oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot
of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary
works of the twentieth century.

If you require more information or would like to submit an etext,
contact Col Choat at colc@gutenberg.net.au.

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 11/28/01**:  4,153
(This number includes the 26 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

"Reserved" count:  57!

Thru 11/28/01:  47 Weeks & 2 Days (331 days)
                 1,093 total new etexts, yr-to-date.  Please advise, I may
                 Weekly avg.:  23.09     have added the 7 new .au's twice!
                 Daily avg:     3.28

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,093 For 331 days,
this is 3.30 per day or 99.06 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1,205 For The Year. . . .
We are about 47 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.

GOOGLE EXPERIMENTS WITH USER RANKINGS
Google is fighting the trend toward the commercialization of Web search
engine rankings by conducting a controversial experiment that gives its
users a say in ranking Web sites' usefulness. If successful, the tool would
provide a more democratic process for determining the company's search
engine results, but the move has already sparked concerns among some search
experts who question its effectiveness. Meanwhile, people who specialize in
pushing sites into top rankings -- a process called search engine
optimization -- say the new twist just represents one more challenge. "Once
a search engine optimizer sets their sights on a search engine, it doesn't
take them long to figure out its weaknesses," says one search engine
optimizer. Google's quest for unbiased results come as search engines are
evolving into a hot marketing tool. Many Web sites, including Yahoo, AOL
and MSN openly run paid listings along with their unpaid results. And some
unscrupulous Web site operators have been known to skew search results by
including hidden text or misleading keywords on pages fed to spiders --
technology agents that search engines use to chart the Web. Google's
user-ranking system is still in the experimental stage, and although some
analysts applaud its good intentions, they say there's still opportunity
for abuse. "People who like their Web sites are going to go to their own
site and punch the happy-face button about a billion times, and people who
want to hurt their competitors will go to their competitors' sites and
punch the unhappy-face button," says Daniel Sullivan, editor of Search
Engine Watch. (CNet News.com 27 Nov 2001)

NEW "WORM" CAN CAPTURE KEYSTROKES
A malicious program called Badtrans is moving around the Internet and
worming itself into vulnerable computers and using a keystroke logger to
surreptitiously record passwords, credit data, and other information. A
virus manager at the security firm McAfee says that the worm "does no
damage to files but does drop a backdoor trojan on the machine which would
allow a hacker to come back and access personal information." Badtrans
spreads through Microsoft's Outlook or Outlook Express e-mail programs and
arrives with an attachment that can be executed simply by reading or
previewing it and doesn't need to be double-clicked or opened separately.

FBI TARGETS SUSPECTS' PCs WITH SPY VIRUS
The FBI is working on software that could insert a computer virus into a
suspect's computer capable of reading encrypted data. The software, known
as "Magic Lantern," installs "keylogging" software that can capture
keystrokes typed on a computer. The virus can be sent via e-mail and once
on the targeted PC, it waits for a suspect to launch the Pretty Good
Privacy encryption program and then logs the passphrase used to start the
program, essentially giving agents access to the keys needed to decrypt
files. The Magic Lantern software is part of the FBI's "Enhanced Carnivore
Project Plan," which operates under the umbrella project name of Cyber
Knight. Electronic Privacy Information Center attorney David Sobel says
privacy issues arise when keylogging results in "overly broad" searches,
since it would be possible to observe every keystroke typed by the suspect,
even if a court order specified only encryption keys. The FBI has already
used a less-sophisticated version of the software to build the high-profile
racketeering case against Nicodemo Scarfo, but had to manually turn the
system on and off in order to comply with the court order.

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers(approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001 we divided the old "gutnberg" list into two new lists:

   gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
   gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

         subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

         subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

         unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
would like more information about Project Gutenberg, including an easy
search tool to find and read our etexts, visit the Official Web Pages
