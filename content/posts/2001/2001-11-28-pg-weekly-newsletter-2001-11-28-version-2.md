Col Choat has moved his Project Gutenberg of Australia website
from:  http://au.geocities.com/gutenberg_au/
to:    http://gutenberg.net.au/

Here's more information from Project Gutenberg of Australia:

Project Gutenberg of Australia

Here in Oz we are celebrating the launch of our permanent PG site,
gutenberg.net.au, after being temporarily located at au.geocities.com
for a time.

We have 26 books listed which are in the public domain in Australia so
why not drop in and have a look!  We also have listed all of the PG
etexts (from both the US and Oz sites) which were written by
Australians or which relate (loosely) to Australia.

Books enter the public domain in Australia 50 years after the author's
death, provided they were published during the author's lifetime. For
translations, the same rules apply to the person translating.
Therefore, we only need to be satisfied that the author died at least
50 years ago and that the work was published during his/her
lifetime. Copyright cannot be renewed or revived by subsequent
publication, nor does a copyright held by a person other than the
author have any validity in such cases.

Of course, works which are in the public domain in Australia may
remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not download, or
read online, such books if they are in a country where copyright
protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death. The
author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral
rights to oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot
of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary
works of the twentieth century.

If you require more information or would like to submit an etext,
contact Col Choat at colc@gutenberg.net.au.

***

And now the weekly Etext update:

Total PG ebooks available online **AS OF 11/28/01**:  4,153
(This number includes the 26 etexts posted at the PG Australia web site.)

"Reserved" count:  57!

Thru 11/28/01:  47 Weeks & 2 Days (331 days)
                 1,093 total new etexts, yr-to-date.  Please advise, I may
                 Weekly avg.:  23.09     have added the 7 new .au's twice!
                 Daily avg:     3.28

The above translates to the following;
Our Total For The Year Is About 1,093 For 331 days,
this is 3.30 per day or 99.06 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1,205 For The Year. . . .
We are about 47 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.

The last list we received indicated these were all the "life +50's":

Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Bulgaria,
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, El Salvador,
Iceland, Japan, (South) Korea, Latvia, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Panama, the Philippines, Poland, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad
and Tobago, and Ukraine are all "life plus 50 years" countries.

Please advise of changes.

Works which are in the public domain in Australia and other "Life + 50"
countries may remain copyrighted in other countries. People may not
download, or read online, such books if they are in a country where
copyright protections extend more than 50 years past an author's death. The
author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and moral rights to
oversee the work in those countries. That still leaves a lot of readers out
there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary works of the
twentieth century.

INTEL ANNOUNCES ANOTHER TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH
Intel has developed a new structure and material for making transistors,
enabling the chipmaker to pack more and faster circuits onto silicon chips,
while reducing heat and power consumption. The new technology, dubbed "the
terahertz transistor," will enable Intel to develop chips with capabilities
such as real-time voice and face recognition. The company says the
terahertz transistors will be as small as 15 nanometers across, compared
with the 70 nanometers currently possible. Some elements of the new
technology will begin appearing in Intel chips as early as 2005. (Wall

SEARCH ENGINES DIG TOO DEEP

Search engines increasingly are unearthing private information such as
passwords, credit card numbers, classified documents, and even computer
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. "The overall problem is
worse than it was in the early days, when you could do AltaVista searches
on the word 'password' and up come hundreds of password files," says
Christopher Klaus, founder and CTO of Internet Security Systems, who notes
that a new tool built into Google to find a variety of file types is
exacerbating the problem. "What's happening with search engines like Google
adding this functionality is that there are a lot more targets to go
after." Google has been revamped to sniff out a wider array of files,
including Adobe PostScript, Lotus 1-2-3, MacWrite, Microsoft Excel,
PowerPoint, Word, and Rich Text Format. Google disavows responsibility for
the security problem, but the company is working on ways to limit the
amount of sensitive information exposed. "Our specialty is discovering,
crawling and indexing publicly available information," says a Google
spokesman. "We define 'public' as anything placed on the public Internet
and not blocked to search engines in any way. The primary burden falls to
the people who are incorrectly exposing this information. But at the same
time, we're certainly aware of the problem , and our development team is
exploring different solutions behind the scenes." (CNET News.com 26 Nov

WORTH THINKING ABOUT: LIFESTYLES AND CHOICES

      NewsScan Daily subscriber Lynn Kearny writes: "I was really glad to
see ideas from "The Lexus and the Olive Tree" featured in Worth Thinking
About. I've gotten a lot of things worth thinking about from reading
Friedman's book. Here is the concept that I find resonates most in my mind
since reading it, and even more so since the events of 9/11:

      "Olive trees are important. They represent everything that roots us,
anchors us, identifies us and locates us in this world -- whether it be
belonging to a family, a community, a tribe, a nation, a religion or, most
of all, a place called home. Olive trees are what give us the warmth of
family, the joy of individuality, the intimacy of personal rituals, the
depth of private relationships, as well as the confidence and security to
reach out and encounter others. We fight so intensely at times over our
olive trees because, at their best, they provide the feelings of
self-esteem and belonging that are as essential for human survival as food
in the belly. At worst, though, when taken to excess, an obsession with our
olive trees leads us to forge identities, bonds and communities based on
the exclusion of others, and at their very worst, when these obsessions
really run amok as with the Nazis in Germany or the Serbs in Yugoslavia,
they lead us to the extermination of others.

      "Conflicts between Serbs and Muslims, Jews and Palestinians,
Armenians and Azeris over who owns which olive tree are so venomous
precisely because they are about who will be at home and anchored in a
local world and who will not be. Their underlying logic is: I must control
this olive tree, because if the other controls it, not only will I be
economically and politically under his thumb, but my whole sense of home
will be lost. I'll never be able to take my shoes off and relax. Few things
are more enraging to people than to have their identity or their sense of
home stripped away. They will die for it, kill for it, sing for it, write
poetry for it, and novelize about it. Because without a sense of home and
belonging, life becomes barren and rootless. And life as a tumbleweed is no
life at all.

      "So then what does the Lexus represent? It represents an equally
fundamental, age-old human drive -- the drive for sustenance, improvement,
prosperity and modernization -- as it is played out in today's
globalization system. The Lexus represents all the burgeoning global
markets, financial institutions and computer technologies with which we
pursue higher living standards today. Yet, for millions of people in
developing countries, the quest for material improvement still involves
walking to a well, plowing a field barefoot behind an ox or gathering wood
and carrying it on their heads for five miles. These people still upload
for a living, not download.

      "For millions of others in developed countries, though, this quest
for material betterment and modernization is increasingly conducted in Nike
shoes, shopping in integrated markets and using the new network
technologies. While different people have different access to the new
markets and technologies that characterize the globalization system, and
derive highly unequal benefits from them, this doesn't change the fact that
they are the defining economic tools of the day and everyone is either
directly or indirectly affected by them...

      "What we are looking at and for is how the age-old quests for
material betterment and for individual and communal identity -- which go
all the way back to Genesis -- play themselves out in today's dominant
international system of globalization. This is the drama of the Lexus and
the olive tree."

HONORARY SUBSCRIBER: ALBERT SCHWEITZER

      Today's Honorary Subscriber is Albert Schweitzer (1875-1965), who
gained fame in his lifetime as a musician, philosopher, theologian, and
medical missionary.

      Born in Kaysersberg, a town near Strasbourg (then part of Germany),
he was educated at the universities of Strasbourg, Paris, and Berlin. His
1899 doctoral thesis in philosophy was on the religious philosophy of
Immanuel Kant and a year later he received a second doctorate in theology.
In 1906 he would publish "The Quest for the Historical Jesus" to begin the
worldwide attention paid throughout his lifetime to his research, lectures,
and writings in philosophy and theology.

      When he was 21 Schweitzer decided on the course for his life. For
nine years he would dedicate himself to the study science, music, and
theology, and then he would devote the rest of his life to serving humanity
directly. In 1900 he was ordained as the curate of the Church of Saint
Nicholas in Strasbourg and a year later became principal of the theological
seminary there. By the age of 30 he was a respected writer on theology, an
accomplished organist, and an authority on the life and work of Johann
Sebastian Bach, whose compositions he performed in the simple, undistorted
style that subsequently became the performance standard.

      In 1904 Schweitzer was inspired to become a medical missionary and in
1906, despite the protests of family and friends, he enrolled in medical
school. In 1912, toward the end of his medical studies, he married Helene
Bresslau, also an accomplished scholar, who studied nursing in order to
share her husband's work.

      In 1913 the Schweitzers sailed for French Equatorial Africa with
medical supplies and 2,000 gold marks they had raised for the construction
of a hospital at Lambarene on the Ogowe River in French Equatorial Africa,
in what is now the republic of Gabon. Over the years his hospital grew into
a large, world-renowned institution that served thousands of African
patients. When his humanitarian work earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in
1952, he used his $33,000 award to expand the hospital further and to build
a leper colony.

      Because he was a German citizen, Schweitzer was twice interned by the
French during World War I. He used these interruptions in his missionary
work to reflect on civilization and to seek a fundamental principle for his
philosophy. He adopted "Reverence for Life" as the key to understanding the
universe and the human mind and spirit, a world view he then set forth in
his 1923 book, "Philosophy of Civilization." For Schweitzer, reverence for
life included not only human life but also all other living things.
Schweitzer died at age 90 in 1965 and was buried at Lambarene in a simple
grave beside his wife who had died in 1957.

The Project Gutenberg Mailing Lists

Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

  gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
  gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

        subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

        subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

        unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg's mailing lists!  If you
