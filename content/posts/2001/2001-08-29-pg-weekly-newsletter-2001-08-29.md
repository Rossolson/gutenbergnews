Subject: S.R. Gardiner's Works

Dear Professor Hart,
thank you for your kind and prompt answer.
The dates of S.R. Gardiner's life and works are as follows:
b.  1829 - d. 1902.
(1863--1882): History of England 1603-1642;
(1886-1891): The Great Civil War;
(1895-1901) Commonwealth and Protectorate (unfinished).
So there shouldn't be any problems for the copyright.

The Great Civil War and Commonwealth and Protectorate were reprinted
in the 1980s by The Windrush Press, and, as far as I am aware, are
still in print.

If you decide to put them on the agenda of Project Gutemberg, and you have
nothing to object, I should feel very flattered if you would entrust the
task to me (at least for one work, provided the copy of the book is
scannable).  I have enough time on my hands to do the job in about a year.
After retiring from teaching (I was reader of Eng. Lit. at the University
of Padua), I am a partner in a typesetting firm and we do a lot of scanning
with Omnipage 8. Of course the scanning is only the first step, as you
know: the most timeconsuming and difficult part of the job is the reading,
correction and encoding of the text (we do all this using MS Word 5.1).
I am aware that all this must be done for free: but I have availed myself
so many times of the e-texts of PG, that I think it a sort of cultural duty
to contribute to the project.
Looking forward to hearing from you
Sincerely
Mario Manzari

Content: "Extensive listing of places where you can download free ebooks,
as well as sites for purchasing ebooks. It also provides hints about how to
read ebooks on different devices, and a pointer to a simple and free tool
that converts plain text ebooks to HTML etc. It even describes how to make
ebooks from paper originals."

On the site is a revised version of the "how to make ebooks" I posted to

*** Progress Chart ***

This is NOT counting the Etexts recently posted on the Project Gutenberg of
Australia site[s]. . .which will be added in a week or so, as we figure up
the ways to include them in our listings, depending on which ones are legal
to post on our US sites.  Even not counting those, we are surpassed 100
Etexts for August. . .but remember, August has five Wednesdays. . . .
However, we HAVE managed to do over 100 Etexts per month since we changed
our scheduled goad from 50 to 100 on our 30th Anniversary, July 4, 2001.

We have added 24 eTexts in the past week.

With 3862 eTexts online as of August 29, it now takes an average of
100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $2.58 from each book,
for Project Gutenberg to have given away $1,000,000,000,000 [One
Trillion Dollars] in books.

*100,000,000 readers is one to two percent of the world's population!*

Our Total For The Year Is About 765 For 241 days,
this is 3.17 per day or 95 Per 30 day month. . . .
This Would Yield About 1159 For The Year. . . .
We are about 35 weeks through the year. . . .
counting each Wednesday as ending one week.

***News Headlines From Newsscan and Edupage***

DIGITAL PIRACY SPREADS FROM MUSIC TO BOOKS
Book publishers are beginning to see the same kind of piracy tactics
recently experienced by the recording industry, and Internet monitoring firm
Envisional predicts that the illegal downloading of books could become as
big a problem as Napster. Envisional found nearly 7,300 copyrighted titles
available for free through file-sharing networks such as Gnutella, including
more than 700 individual copies of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books. In
most cases, the book has been scanned and converted into downloadable text,
but in a few instances hackers had cracked the copyright protection codes to
e-books and made them available. Envisional says the files it found are
simply the tip of the iceberg. "It's a relatively conservative estimate of
the number of illegal books out there," says an Envisional executive.

INTEL INTRODUCES PENTIUM 4 CHIP
Intel is releasing its new 2-gigahertz microprocessor, to be priced in the
mid-$500 range (about half of what it charged for its fastest chips a year
ago); prices on the older Pentium chips will be cut by as much as 54%, as
part of a continuing price war between Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.
Industry analyst Douglas Lee says, "Intel has made it very clear that they
are going to rapidly push the Pentium 4 into the mainstream desktop. I don't
think Intel's mission is to kill AMD. Their primary mission is to stimulate
PC demand. What that does to AMD is helpful to their business, but I don't
think it's the primary objective." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 23 Aug 2001)

WORK FROM HOME, SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT
The U.S. Commerce Department has begun a pilot program that will give
economic incentives to companies in five cities with poor air quality --
Los Angeles, Houston, Denver, Philadelphia and Washington -- for allowing
their employees to telecommute. Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta assured a
group of Los Angeles executives: "E-commuting is a tool that help your
employees be more productive workers. It could be the best thing you do for
your bottom line this year." (AP/San Jose Mercury News 22 Aug 2001)

LIBRARY PACT SIGNALS NEW CHAPTER IN E-BOOK LENDING
California State University system is working with NetLibrary to provide
simultaneous access to electronic books for multiple borrowers -- a
significant change in how subscription models generally work. Previously, a
single copy of an e-book could be borrowed by only one reader at a time --
just like a print version. Under the new rules, half of the 1,500 e-books
owned by Cal State will be available to multiple readers at the same time,
at no extra cost. Libraries need to exert more influence in the ongoing
debate over the fledgling e-book industry, says Evan Reader, of the CSU
Chancellor's office. "They accept what's put on the plate.  We don't want
to do that." The Cal State system has 23 campuses and 370,000 students. "I
suspect (NetLibrary) went along with it because of our size," says Reader.

FBI'S CARNIVORE MIGHT TARGET WIRELESS TEXT
An association of telecommunications carriers warns that the
FBI could soon be using the Carnivore electronic eavesdropping
device to capture wireless text messages. In a letter sent to the
FCC, Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association general
counsel Michael Altschul said that the telecom industry could
not devise sufficient standards and procedures to allow FBI
investigators to capture the contents of wireless text messages
the same way they can listen in on analog communications. Such
ability is required by law, and thus the industry's failure to
provide the FBI with a solution could mean the use of Carnivore,
which privacy and technology experts say gleans far more
information than is needed by investigators. Privacy advocates
say that Carnivore has not been shown to be as selective in the
gathering of information as targeted data collection carried
out by ISPs.  (Washington Post, 24 August 2001)

MOBILE COMPUTER LAB COMBATS DIGITAL DIVIDE
The Community College Foundation of California promotes
technology awareness in poor urban areas with eBuses. An eBus
is a mobile computer lab with workstations and a satellite
linkup that travels through underprivileged neighborhoods,
offering computer training and Web access services. The
foundation is sponsoring a six-week eBus tour in Illinois.
Corporate sponsors and state organizations will work with the
eBus to facilitate its state-wide promotion.  The foundation's
Joyce Schriebman noted that raising technology awareness through
initiatives like eBus is one way to bridge the digital divide in
communities that lack funding, local facilities, and Internet
connectivity. "We can just park the bus and people come right
up," she said. "We'll park in front of a library, do some
training, and then show people that the same technology is
available inside that library."
(Wireless Newsfactor, 23 August 2001)

MALAYSIA'S INTERNET ROAD SHOW
Malaysia's Mobile Internet Unit is sparking interest elsewhere in
similar initiatives to bridge the digital divide. Ghana already
has buses filled with computers rolling through rural areas, and
Lebanon, Iran, and other countries are interested in having a bus
program of their own. Started in Malaysia in 1998, the Mobile
Internet Unit is a bus tour through the countryside designed to
introduce poor children to computers and the Internet. Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamed said Malaysia, which has nearly half as
many Internet users per capita as the United States, is committed
to a "knowledge economy," and the government plans to increase
the number of the project's buses by 20 over the next four years.
The Mobile Internet Unit is a United Nations Development Program,
and the agency's Asia-Pacific Development Information Program
hopes the bus program can be used to relieve some fears often
associated with the Internet in some parts of the world. The bus
program was the idea of the former head of the Asia-Pacific
Development Information Program, Gabriel Accascina.

E-TEXTBOOKS OFFER LIGHT READING
College educators sympathize with students over the rising
costs of textbooks as well as the inconvenience of carrying
them around, while sales of used textbooks do not yield any
revenue for publishers and authors. These developments are making
both teachers and publishers see the advantage in providing
customized, interactive digital textbooks to students, said
Forrester Research analyst Dan O'Brien. The University of Phoenix
has initiated a plan to convert itself into a "bookless college."
And efforts such as Adobe's eBook Initiative help teachers develop
their own digital courseware. Experts such as the University of
Phoenix's Dr. Adam Honea believe that e-textbooks will eventually
supplant print textbooks.
