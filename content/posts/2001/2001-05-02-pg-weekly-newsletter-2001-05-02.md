50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVAC
Computer aficionados are now celebrating the 50th anniversary of the
UNIVAC, the first computer designed for commercial use. The first UNIVAC
("Universal Automatic Computer") was sold to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Another early model of the machine was used in 1952 to predict Adlai
Stevenson's defeat by Dwight D. Eisenhower in that year's presidential
election. The accurate prediction made word "UNIVAC" synonymous in the
public mind with "computer." The typical UNIVAC cost at that time $1-1.5
million (almost $10 million in today's dollars) and took up 350 square feet
of floor space. (San Jose Mercury News 1 May 2001)
