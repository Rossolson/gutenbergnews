Doug Paul, we have a copyright clearance for you, but no email address.


If you have sent in Etexts to be posted, but are not sure they have been,
or have sent in copyright research, please let me know [hart@pobox.com].

If our catalog on gutenberg.net [promo.net/pg] misses them, please let Alev,
our Chief Cataloguer know Alev Akman &lt;alevwho@mediaone.net&gt;.  She is sure
she is up to date with all the entries she has, but some may not have been
received in her email, or could have been lost in various crashes.


When we send out the Project Gutenberg Newsletters, we
have already posted all the files listed in that index
listing we include in the Newsletters [excepting those
marked as "reserved," of course.

While our human cataloguers and indexers of course can
not had time to add them to their files yet, computers
will already have them listed. . .and thus you will be
able to download them, literally only one second after
we have started to post them, even before our own post
of them has been completely uploaded. . . !

For "instant" access to our new Etexts you can surf to:
http://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03
or
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91, 90.


You will need the first five letters of the filenames listed below.


We have a total of 18 new files to download this week:
[This would yield a total of 936 new files per year.]


If you sent in a file you don't see here, or sent in a revision, or xeroxes
for our copyright research, and haven't heard from me let me know.  Most of
these should only take a few days.

COURT SIDES WITH WRITERS OVER COPYRIGHT DISPUTE
In a blow to big media firms, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that
freelance writers may control whether articles they write for print
publication can then be reproduced in electronic form. Large publishers
have argued that if they have to renegotiate over electronic publication
rights, they probably will remove a substantial amount of material from
their electronic databases. "Historians, scholars and the public lose
because of the holes in history created by the removal of these articles
from electronic issues of newspapers such as the Times," said New York
Times chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. The ruling will affect primarily
content written before the mid 1990s, which most publishers updated their
contracts to include electronic as well as print publishing rights. The
National Writers Union, however, estimates a range of potential liabilities
between $2.5 billion and $600 billion. The decision in this case could have
broad ramifications in similar disputes in the book and music publishing
businesses. (Wall Street Journal 26 Jun 2001)

MICROSOFT SHUTS DOWN FREE LISTBOT SERVICE
In a continuing effort to replace free services with paid-subscription
services, Microsoft is shutting down its free newsletter-distribution
service but will continue to offer business list-management software for a
fee. One newsletter publisher said sympathetically: "It doesn't really make
sense to offer free services anymore on the Internet. It's about revenue
now, and if it's not revenue-generating, there's no value from a business
perspective." (AP/Washington Post 24 Jun 2001)
