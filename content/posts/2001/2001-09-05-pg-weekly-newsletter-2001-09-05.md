***News Headlines From Newsscan and Edupage***

HP TO ACQUIRE COMPAQ
Hewlett-Packard is buying Compaq Computer in a $25-billion deal that would
create an information technology behemoth with annual revenues of about $87
billion. The deal presents a potential threat to industry giant IBM, which
had revenues of slightly more than $88 billion last year. HP chairman and
CEO Carly Fiorina will retain her titles and Compaq chairman and CEO
Michael Capellas will become president of HP. "This is a decisive move that
accelerates our strategy and positions us to win," says Fiorina. "At a
particularly challenging time for the IT industry, this combination vaults
us into a leadership role." (Financial Times 4 Sep 2001)

BITS OF EVIDENCE
A growing number of consultants now specialize in helping law firms prepare
for trail by sorting through electronic documents and e-mail messages found
either on a defendant's own computer or on file server systems. Computers
can identify documents by date, authors, recipients and keywords, and can
frequently yield information the author thought had been erased. Attorney
Michael Epstein says: "You know for a paper document, it's either there or
it isn't. With e-mail, it's a little different." He provides the example of
a lawsuit bought by one company against its former employees, whose denials
of working for themselves on company time were refuted by evidence of their
personal activities obtained by restoring files erased from the computers
they had used at work. (New York Times 4 Sep 2001)
