 Project Gutenberg's Weekly Newsletter for Wednesday, October 17, 2001

           ***Over 4000 titles online, as of today***

We need your support more than ever. . .donation information follows!

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]

*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*

***

Please send in as much copyright research as you can this week!
. . .as I plan to be away for November, and don't want to swamp
Greg Newby with more copyright research than is necessary.

If you have sent in over a week ago that have not gone through,
please resend.  We didn't get much of any mail for the 10 days
after 9/11, and I don't think it's ever going to come.

Project Gutenberg a finalist in The Tech Awards:

We are pleased to share the news that Project Gutenberg has been
selected as a finalist in the education category for the Tech Museum
of Innovation Awards- "Technology Benefiting Humanity."  Our work, and
that of four other finalists, was chosen from over 400 candidates in
over 50 different countries.

Our work will be honored in San Jose at the Tech Museum's Award Gala
on November 1, 2001, an event celebrating the application of
technology to improve the human condition.  One finalist in each of
the five categories: Education, Equality, Economic Development
Environment and Health will be presented a $50,000 award for the
furtherance of their work.  If you are interested in more information
or attending the Tech Museum of Innovation Awards gala event, please
visit http://www.thetech.org/techawards/info.html.

Dr. Greg Newby, incoming CEO of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation, will be traveling to San Jose to attend the awards ceremony.

We need some volunteers who can spend just a minute or two looking
over each of the three or so eTexts we post on the average day....
Just to download them and check to see that nothing went wrong in
final save and upload process.  Some times there will be missing
"hard returns" or there will be trailing spaces on some or all
of the lines, or there won't be the proper end of file marker,
margination, or header entries.  Nothing sophisticated here, we
just want to be able to catch obvious errors, and we can provide
a program we are porting to various operating system to make this
even easier as we go along.  100 Etexts per month is just too much
for any small group of people to do well. . . .

HANDSPRING TO DEBUT ALL-IN-ONE UNIT
Handspring announced its new line of handheld organizers that will
incorporate built-in cell phone, Web-browsing and e-mail features. The
all-in-one Treo devices, which will hit the shelves in early 2002, could
help revitalize the sluggish PDA market, analysts say. "Over the past year,
of all othe devices that have come out -- the Palms, the Handsprings, the
Pocket PCs -- all of them have given current users very little reason to
upgrade," says an IDC analyst. The Treo 180 features a tiny keyboard
similar to those used in e-mail pagers and the Treo 180g uses Palm's
Graffiti handwriting recognition system. Both weigh 5.4 ounces and are
priced at $399. A color-screen version, the Treo 270, is tentatively priced
at $599 and will be available by mid-2002. (AP 15 Oct 2001)

GOV'T PLANS NEW CELL PHONE PRIORITY SYSTEM FOR CELLPHONES
Presidential cybersecurity advisor Richard Clarke has proposed a new system
for prioritizing cell phone calls. Currently, new callers get through on a
first-come-first-served basis; in the future, priority will be given to 911
calls and calls made by government officials who have special access codes.
The wireless industry says it fully supports implementation of the new
system. (AP/New York Times 11 Oct 2001)

[PBS Finally Publicly Admits To Wanting To Air Commercial Ads]

FCC WILL ALLOW ADS ON PUBLIC TV'S DIGITAL BROADCASTS
The Federal Communications Commission has voted 3-1 to let public
broadcasters sell ads and other services on their digital television
broadcasts, which are now offered by 38 of the nation's public TV stations.
FCC chairman Michael K. Powell says that the change in policy in no way
compromises "the soul of public broadcasting." Andy Schwartzman, president
of the nonprofit Media Access Project, disagrees, and intends to challenge
the decision in court: "The whole point of creating public television was to
have a noncommercial preserve for television," Schwartzman says. (Los
Angeles Times 12 Oct 2001)

RIAA WANTS TO HACK YOUR PC
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) tried
to attach amendments to the antiterrorism act that would allow
it to hack people's computers with impunity in order to delete
illegally copied files. Privacy and consumer advocates were
alarmed over the original language of the amendment, language
which the RIAA has now backed away from. The RIAA now is trying
to keep the Deterrence and Prevention of Cyberterrorism portion
of the act from changing current federal law allowing copyright
holders to take limited action against networks trading pirated
files. Under language currently in the legislation, any persons
involved in hacking attempts that total $5,000 in damages over
one year would be guilty of a criminal act.

PROBE OF ONLINE MUSIC BUSINESS EXPANDS
The Justice Department has served subpoenas to the five major
record labels and their two new online music services in order
to determine whether there was illegal coordination to block
other companies from the market. Although companies are allowed
some coordination to discuss copyright and licensing matters,
the industry's own online music services, pressplay and MusicNet,
have been granted universal licenses when independent services
have fought long for the same rights. European antitrust
investigators are also looking into the jointly launched
services, which are divided in terms of technology and
competitors. MusicNet relies on RealNetworks technology and
licenses from AOL Time Warner, Bertelsmann, and EMI, whereas
pressplay operates on Microsoft technology and music from Sony
and Vivendi.  (Wall Street Journal. 15 October 2001)

BROADBAND AND MAIN
Evanston, Illinios is pioneering an all-broadband community as
it strives to remain independent of Chicago, the metropolis
bordering the city's south side. The town's business and
community leaders joined together to form e-Tropolis Evanston
and have managed to boost high-speed Internet access to 15
percent of the 33,000 resident households, compared to the
national average of 6 percent. E-Tropolis Evanston has
encountered many obstacles in its quest for ubiquitous broadband,
including the shutdown of independent ISPs the group originally
contracted with and a stark demographic divide between the city's
rich and poor. E-Tropolis Evanston organizers signed a deal with
AT&T to extend more reliable cable modem service to that city
and launched a Recreation Education Center in the city's poor
southeast neighborhood to boost the Internet skills of all its
residents.  (Business Week, 8 October 2001)

SAYING GOODBYE TO THE STYLUS
Technologists at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center and other
speech recognition labs are pioneering new software that makes the
handheld computer a voice-computing platform. Such computers are
able to accept voice commands and reply to questions. Currently,
IBM has succeeded in equipping Palm and Compaq PDAs and other
handhelds with microphones, speakers, and extra processing power
so that they can be operated without a stylus. This approach
capitalizes on recent improvements in battery life and processing
power. The strategy differs from that of Microsoft, which favors
wireless connections between handhelds and central processors
that translate voice data. Meanwhile, speech software company
Voice Signal Technologies has succeeded in compacting its voice
recognition software to about one megabyte of memory, letting
handhelds process e-mail dictation.

DIGITAL FREELANCERS WIN AGAIN
The Supreme Court turned down an appeal Tuesday regarding
reprinted photos from National Geographic, which insisted it
would be impossible to find all freelance journalists whose
stories and photographs were used in each of the issues. The
problem came to light when the magazine was sued by freelance
photographer Jerry Greenberg after National Geographic sold a
CD-ROM that included computer versions of issues from 1888 to
1996. Greenberg said the CD release had music, a new
advertisement, and other items not included in the original
versions, which makes it a new product worthy of reimbursement
to freelancers. The Supreme Court agreed with Greenberg, having
also ruled in favor of freelance journalists in New York Times
v. Tasini, saying journalists have rights in regards to work
posted on the Internet.  (Associated Press, 9 October 2001)
