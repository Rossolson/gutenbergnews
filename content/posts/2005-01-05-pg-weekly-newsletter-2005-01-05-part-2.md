.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

   http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).  And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language
at the above link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.  To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate
the one nearest to you, visit:

   http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

If you prefer to download eBooks via other methods than from the search
page, and need additional information, please refer to the file
GUTINDEX.ALL, available for viewing or downloading at:

   http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL

That file contains descriptions and explanations about the filenaming
process, directory structure, file formats, and more.

And to directly access the file directories:

   http://gutenberg.net/dirs/

Please note that the Project Gutenberg Production Team continues the
process of manually re-posting those eBooks originally posted prior to
Nov 2003 to the new filenaming and directory system (based on the eBook
number).  This process includes some file maintenance (repairing,
correcting and re-formatting to current PG standards where practicable).
These re-postings are noted in the "corrections" listings below.  More
information can be found in the file GUTINDEX.ALL mentioned above.

                        [ This Week's Other Stuff ]
=============================================================================

Milestone:  EBook #400 was posted this week at Project Gutenberg of
Australia.  Congratulations to Col Choate and the rest of that "huge" &lt;g&gt;
posting team "down under"!

~ ~ ~

&gt;From David Price, about #14547, Gwaith Mynyddog.  Cyfrol II:

For those interested: Mynyddog (real name Richard Davies) was born in
Llanbrynmair, Mont. in Wales in 1833.  Well known as a conductor and
soloist he was also a poet.  This book is the second volume in a
collection of his works. Most of the literary criticism of today damns
his poetry but some of his verse is still popular.

In pure conincidence the last Welsh eBook (Gwaith Samuel Roberts) also
had an author born in Llanbryn-mair (in 1800).  The place itself is very
small and it's noteworthy that it produced two important Welsh literary
figures within a few decades.

~ ~ ~

And about #14540, When William Came:

For those wishing to know: Murrey Yeovil has been away from England for a
long time.  When he returns the "fait accompli" has occured.  The story
follows his life as he attempts to make sense of the new England.  What
was the "fait accompli"?  Well, for that you have to read the story.  The
occasional witty remark breaks up a rather depressing novel.

~ ~ ~

Also, about #14576, Modern Mythology, by Andrew Lang:

For those wishing to know: Max Muller (a famous Victorian researcher and
linguist) had written a rather nasty piece about Andrew Lang's views on
mythology.  This book is Lang's response and is in part a defense of
Lang's method and also a critical look at Max Muller's approach to
mythological research.  It's very technical those looking for an
introduction to the ideas might be better reading Custom and Myth by
Andrew Lang first.

~ ~ ~

And from David Widger, about #14568, Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight:

NOTE: The Old English "yogh" characters have been translated both upper
and lower-case yoghs to digit 3's. There are Unicode allocations for
these (in HTML Ȝ and ȝ) but at present no font which implements
these. Substiting the digit 3 seemed a workable compromise which anybody
can read. The linked html "Old English 'yogh' file" uses Ȝ and
ȝ representations, and is included for users with specialist fonts.

~ ~ ~

A true friend reaches for your hand and touches your heart.
