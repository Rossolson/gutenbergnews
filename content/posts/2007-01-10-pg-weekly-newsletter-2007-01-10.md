                  THE PROJECT GUTENBERG YEARLY REPORT FOR 2006
                               by Michael Hart

Last year we first started counting PGEu and PrePrints but I never got an
accurate listing of the duplications from a PGEU listing and the overall
totals. Our new editor has it much more accurately figured out since he
started and will start accounting for these duplications next week. Expect
the grand total to drop by about 350, from where you might have expected it
under last years accounting. Please note the addition of the PGEu totals will
make last year bigger and this coming year smaller, as we started with about
200 PGEu duplications and ended up with about 350.

You will notice certain statistical changes pointed out in the counts as
the years change.


Counting ONLY Books as under US or Australian copyright:

2007  21,669 -- 2006  17,926  [Includes Australian totals]

3,723 new

4,104 counting 381 added from PrePrints


We started with 218 PG Europe eBooks and ended with 408 with a gain of 190,
nearly doubling the PGEu collection, thus:

2007  22,077 -- 2006  18,144  [Including BOTH PGAU & PGEu]

3,933 added

4,314 counting 381 added from PrePrints

WARNING: In the future these numbers will appear smaller as we account for
the PGEu duplications.


2006 ended with 20,215 under US copyright up 2808
2006 ended with  1,454 under AU copyright up  935
2006 ended with 21,669 combined effort    up 3743

2005 ended with 17,407 under US copyright
2005 ended with    519 under AU copyright
2005 ended with 17,926 combined effort

WARNING: After our 35th anniversary, the PGAu counts were kept separately
rather than added in this count, and any error in making up for that
is MINE (M. Hart). Our 35 anniversary was July 4, 2006.


Adding in the PGEu total of 408 yields the following:

2006 ended with 20,215 under US copyright  up 2808
2006 ended with  1,454 under AU copyright  up  935
2006 ended with    408 in the PGEu library up  190
2006 ended with 22,077 combined effort     up 4151


Adding in the PGEu total of 218 yields the following:

2005 ended with 17,407 under US copyright
2005 ended with    519 under AU copyright
2005 ended with    218 under EU listings
2005 ended with 18,144 combined effort

WARNING: My own calculations are being done by hand and in a rather
hurried manner, we should have a new report for you next week, perhaps
somewhat improved.


Adding in the PGPP total of 381 yields the following:

2006 ended with 20,596 under US copyright  up 2808
2006 ended with  1,454 under AU copyright  up  935
2006 ended with    408 in the PGEu library up  190
2006 ended with    381 in the PGPP section up  381
2006 ended with 22,458 combined effort     up 4314


NOTES: There may be some counting discrepancies or errors between the various
and sundry counting methods we have employed.

These figures run from January 4, 2006 to January 3, 2007, as our production
statistics run Wednesday to Wednesday at 10:45AM, Central Standard Time.

NOTES:

At the start of 2007, the PG-US total had been adjusted (by -350 eBooks) to
take into consideration the duplications from PG-EU. Please remember that
other totals may also have been affected.
This figure (-350) is only approximate, we will update once we have received
the exact figure from PG-EU.

We have several counting methods that often differ by several books. There
is also some duplication between the various collections. Volunteers will
need to take these duplications into account.

The PG Australia total does NOT include PGAU eBooks posted at the U.S.
website; www.gutenberg.org.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire collections to fully
appear in the PrePrints Section, thus the count sometimes jumps by a large
number when the files are eventually completed and added in. Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move later to other
locations, including the main collection or The Project Gutenberg Consortia
Center, etc. For example, on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks
appeared, and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send them to the
PrePrints Section took well over a month.
Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section, it still takes a
certain amount of time to collect and put such a large collection online in a
proper manner.
