 ** IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT * IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT * IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT **

Modifications to the count of Project Gutenberg eBooks for 2007.

On the second Wednesday of 2007 the Project Gutenberg Newsletter will start
another official year of recording the progress of an attempt to create a
world public library on the Internet.

This is because Project Gutenberg runs on a weekly schedule from the first
Wednesday of each year to the first Wednesday of a new year, so the first
weekly totals of the new year come out on the second Wednesday of that year,
after the first production week.

There will be one particularly noticeable change, in that eBooks from Project
Gutenberg of Europe that appear in both the listing of PG of Europe and the
US public domain listings will now be in a mode that subtracts out the
duplications.

Due to poor communications I was uncertain as to how many of the PG of Europe
eBooks were actually also listed as in US copyright lists and appeared on both
European and American server lists.

Michael Cook, our new Newsletter Editor, has been very judicious in his efforts
to create the most accurate totals possible, so this new counting methodology
should appear for the first time on the second Wednesday of the
new year. . .i.e. next week.

As you may know, Project Gutenberg of Europe just celebrated the completion
of their 400th eBook, and I think you will be greatly surprised to find out
how many of these are included in the U.S. public domain listings.

that's ~269 eBooks per Month for ~72.00 Months.


NOTES:

We have several counting methods that often differ by several books. There
is also some duplication between the various collections. Volunteers will
need to take these duplications into account.

The PG Australia total does NOT include PGAU eBooks posted at the U.S.
website; www.gutenberg.org.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire collections to fully
appear in the PrePrints Section, thus the count sometimes jumps by a large
number when the files are eventually completed and added in. Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move later to other
locations, including the main collection or The Project Gutenberg Consortia
Center, etc. For example, on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks
appeared, and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send them to the
PrePrints Section took well over a month.
Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section, it still takes a
certain amount of time to collect and put such a large collection online in a
proper manner.
